overview 

marathon petroleum corporation “mpc” has over 130 years of history in the energy business and is a leading integrated downstream energy company we operate the nations largest refining system with approximately 29 million barrels per day of crude oil refining capacity and believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers in the united states we distribute our refined products through one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges in addition our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and ngls from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets 

our operations consist of two reportable operating segments refining  marketing and midstream each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers 

• refining  marketing – refines crude oil and other feedstocks including renewable feedstocks at our refineries in the gulf coast midcontinent and west coast regions of the united states purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products including renewable diesel through transportation storage distribution and marketing services provided largely by our midstream segment we sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally to buyers on the spot market to independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily marathon ® branded outlets and through longterm supply contracts with direct dealers who operate locations mainly under the arco ® brand 

• midstream – transports stores distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for the refining  marketing segment via refining logistics assets pipelines terminals towboats and barges gathers processes and transports natural gas and gathers transports fractionates stores and markets ngls the midstream segment primarily reflects the results of mplx lp “mplx” mplx is a diversified largecap master limited partnership “mlp” formed in 2012 that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets and provides fuels distribution services as of december 31 2021 we owned the general partner of mplx and approximately 64 percent of the outstanding mplx common units 

corporate history and structure 

mpc was incorporated in delaware on november 9 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of marathon oil corporation “marathon oil” on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its refining marketing  transportation business into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil on june 30 2011 our common stock trades on the nyse under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

on october 1 2018 we acquired andeavor andeavor shareholders received in the aggregate approximately 2398 million shares of mpc common stock valued at 198 billion and 35 billion in cash andeavor was a highly integrated marketing logistics and refining company operating primarily in the western and midcontinent united states our acquisition of andeavor in 2018 substantially increased our geographic diversification and the scale of our assets which provides increased opportunities to optimize our system

refined product yields 

the following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years 



a product yields include renewable production 

crude oil supply 

we obtain the crude oil we refine through negotiated term contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market our term contracts generally have marketrelated pricing provisions the following table provides information on our sources of crude oil for each of the last three years the crude oil sourced outside of north america was acquired from various foreign national oil companies production companies and trading companies 



our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks and distribute our refined products through a variety of channels including pipelines trucks railcars ships and barges 

renewable fuels 

the dickinson north dakota renewable fuels facility began operations at the end of 2020 and reached full design operating capacity in the second quarter of 2021 the facility has the capacity to produce 184 million gallons per year of renewable diesel from corn oil soybean oil fats and greases the produced renewable diesel generates federal rins and lcfs credits when sold in california or similar markets these instruments are used to help meet our renewable fuel standard and lcfs compliance obligations as a petroleum fuel producer 

on february 24 2021 we announced our plan to strategically reposition the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility converting the martinez facility from refining petroleum to manufacturing renewable fuels signals our strong commitment to producing a substantial level of lower carbonintensity fuels in california as envisioned the martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022 with pretreatment capabilities coming online in 2023 the facility is expected to be capable of producing approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023 

our wholly owned subsidiary virent operates an advanced biofuels facility in madison wisconsin at which it is working to commercialize a process for converting biobased feedstocks into renewable fuels and chemicals during 2021 virent contributed to an aviation industry first as united airlines flew an aircraft full of passengers using 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel “saf” in one engine and petroleumbased jet fuel in the other virent used its bioform ® process to produce synthesized aromatic kerosene – a critical component that made the 100 percent saf possible 

on december 14 2021 we finalized the formation of a joint venture with archerdanielsmidland company “adm” for the production of soybean oil to supply rapidly growing demand for renewable diesel fuel the joint venture which is named green bison soy processing llc will own and operate a soybean processing complex in spiritwood north dakota with adm owning 75 percent of the joint venture and mpc owning 25 percent when complete in 2023 the spiritwood facility will source and process local soybeans and supply the resulting soybean oil exclusively to mpc the spiritwood complex is expected to produce approximately 600 million pounds of refined soybean oil annually enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable diesel per year 

we hold an ownership interest in ethanol production facilities in albion michigan logansport indiana greenville ohio and denison iowa these plants have a combined ethanol production capacity of approximately 475 million gallons per year and are managed by our joint venture partner the andersons

our refined products are sold to independent retailers wholesale customers our brand jobbers and direct dealers in addition we sell refined products for export to international customers as of december 31 2021 there were 7159 brand jobber outlets in 37 states the district of columbia and mexico where independent entrepreneurs primarily maintain marathonbranded outlets we also have longterm supply contracts for 1086 direct dealer locations primarily in southern california largely under the arco ® brand we believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our market area 

the following table sets forth our refined product sales volumes by product group for each of the last three years 



a refined product sales include volumes marketed directly to endusers and tradingsupply volumes such as bulk sales to large unbranded resellers and other downstream companies 

b sales include renewable products 

refined product sales destined for export 

we sell gasoline distillates and asphalt for export primarily out of our garyville galveston bay anacortes and los angeles refineries the following table sets forth our refined product sales destined for export by product group for the past three years 



gasoline and distillates 

we sell gasoline gasoline blendstocks and distillates including no 1 and no 2 fuel oils jet fuel kerosene diesel fuel and renewable diesel to wholesale customers branded jobbers direct dealers and in the spot market in addition we sell diesel fuel and gasoline for export to international customers the demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months 

feedstocks and petrochemicals 

we are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and petrochemicals product availability varies by refinery and includes among others propylene naphtha xylene benzene butane alkylate raffinate cumene platformate and toluene we market these products domestically to customers in the chemical agricultural and fuelblending industries in addition we produce fuelgrade coke at our garyville detroit galveston bay and los angeles refineries which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications and anodegrade coke at our los angeles and robinson refineries in addition to calcined coke at our los angeles refinery which are both used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry 

asphalt 

we have refinerybased asphalt production capacity of up to 141 mbpcd which includes asphalt cements polymermodified asphalt emulsified asphalt industrial asphalts and roofing flux we have a broad customer base including asphaltpaving contractors resellers government entities states counties cities and townships and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers we sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail barge and vessel 

propane 

we produce propane at all of our refineries propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles our propane sales are split approximately 80 percent and 20 percent between the home heating market and industrialpetrochemical consumers respectively 

heavy fuel oil 

we produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components including slurry at all of our refineries heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering fuel industries though there are other more specialized uses of the product 

terminals and transportation 

we transport store and distribute crude oil feedstocks and refined products through pipelines terminals and marine fleets owned by mplx and third parties in our market areas 

we own a fleet of transport trucks and trailers for the movement of refined products and crude oil in addition we maintain a fleet of leased and owned railcars for the movement and storage of refined products 

the locations and detailed information about our refining  marketing assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of refined products 

we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale including exports spot branded and retail distribution our marketing operations compete with numerous other independent marketers integrated oil companies and highvolume retailers we compete with companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market and refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded independent entrepreneurs in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and retail consumers 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils ans wti and meh crude oils and other market structure impacts also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for our refining  marketing segment for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

midstream 

the midstream segment primarily includes the operations of mplx our sponsored mlp and certain related operations retained by mpc 

mplx 

mplx owns and operates a network of crude oil natural gas and refined product pipelines and has joint ownership interests in other crude oil and refined products pipelines mplx also owns and operates light products terminals storage assets and maintains a fleet of owned and leased towboats and barges mplx’s assets also include natural gas gathering systems and natural gas processing and ngl fractionation complexes 

mpcretained midstream assets and investments 

we have ownership interests in several crude oil and refined products pipeline systems and pipeline companies and have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures through our investment in crowley coastal partners 

the locations and detailed information about our midstream assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

our midstream operations face competition for natural gas gathering crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services in obtaining unprocessed ngls for gathering transportation and fractionation and in marketing our products and services competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants operating efficiency and reliability residue gas and ngl market connectivity the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered and the fees charged for the services supplied to the customer competition for oil supplies is based primarily on the price and scope of services location of gatheringtransportation and storage facilities and connectivity to the best priced markets competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of fractionation capacity proximity to supply and industry marketing centers the fees charged for fractionation services and operating efficiency and reliability of service competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and ngls is based primarily on price credit and market connectivity in addition certain of our midstream operations are subject to rate regulation which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

our midstream segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and ngls and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year 

regulatory matters 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations including those relating to the protection of the environment such laws and regulations include among others the clean air act “caa” with respect to air emissions the clean water act “cwa” with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized 

for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsenvironmental matters and compliance costs for additional information regarding regulatory risks see item 1a risk factors 

rate regulation 

some of our existing pipelines are considered interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” under the interstate commerce act the “ica” energy policy act of 1992 “epact 1992” and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws the ica and ferc regulations require that tariff rates for oil pipelines a category that includes crude oil and petroleum product pipelines be just and reasonable and the terms and conditions of service must not be unduly discriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed tariff rates or terms and conditions of service or any change to tariff rates or terms and conditions of service and authorizes ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such proposal or change for a period of time to investigate if upon completion of an investigation ferc finds that the new or changed service or rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation an interested person may also challenge existing terms and conditions of service or rates and ferc may order a carrier to change its terms and conditions of service or rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may also obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

epact 1992 deemed certain interstate petroleum pipeline rates then in effect to be just and reasonable under the ica these rates are commonly referred to as “grandfathered rates” our rates for interstate transportation service in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of the passage of epact 1992 were deemed just and reasonable and therefore are grandfathered subsequent changes to those rates are not grandfathered new rates have since been established after epact 1992 for certain pipelines and the rates for certain of our refined products pipelines have subsequently been approved as marketbased rates 

ferc permits regulated oil pipelines to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index a carrier must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

air 

greenhouse gas emissions 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to greenhouse gas emissions climate change and climate adaptation will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review discussion or implementation reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities iii capture the emissions from our facilities and iv administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments 

in february 2021 the interagency working group on the social cost of greenhouse gases published interim estimates of the social cost of carbon methane and nitrous oxide and is expected to finalize its estimates in 2022 the social cost of carbon methane and nitrous oxide can be used to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations a higher social cost could support more stringent greenhouse gas emission regulation 

states are becoming active in regulating greenhouse gas emissions these measures may include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to report emissions and impose emission reductions these measures may also include lowcarbon fuel standards such as the california program or a state carbon tax these measures could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented for example california has enacted a capandtrade program much of the compliance costs associated with the california program are ultimately passed on to the consumer in the form of higher fuel costs states are increasingly announcing aspirational goals to be netzero carbon emissions by a certain date through both legislation and executive orders to date these states have not provided significant details as to achievement of these goals however meeting these aspirations will require a reduction in fossil fuel combustion andor a mechanism to capture greenhouse gases from the 

atmosphere as a result we cannot currently predict the impact of these potential regulations on our liquidity financial position or results of operations 

other air emissions 

in 2021 epa announced it is reconsidering the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for ozone and particulate matter lowering of the naaqs and subsequent designation as a nonattainment area could result in increased costs associated with or result in cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities or could require emission reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities 

in california the governing board for the south coast air quality management district “scaqmd” adopted rule 11091 in november 2021 which establishes best available retrofit control technology “barct” oxides of nitrogen “nox” and carbon monoxide “co” emission limits for combustion equipment at petroleum refineries these new requirements will replace the regional clean air incentives market “reclaim” capandtrade program which has required a staged refinerywide reduction of nox emissions over the last several years and will result in additional emission reductions from our los angeles refinery compliance with rule 11091 is being phased in through 2032 and will result in increased costs to operate and maintain our los angeles refinery 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other things requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances opa90 also requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages and provides for civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we operate tank vessels and facilities from which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

on october 22 2019 epa and the united states army corps of engineers “army corps” published a final rule to repeal the 2015 “clean water rule definition of waters of the united states” “2015 rule” which amended portions of the code of federal regulations “cfr” to restore the regulatory text that existed prior to the 2015 rule effective december 23 2019 the rule repealing the 2015 clean water rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts on april 21 2020 epa and the army corps promulgated the navigable waters protection rule “2020 rule” to define “waters of the united states” the 2020 rule has been challenged in court the biden administration has signaled its intent to revisit the definition of “waters of the united states” and replace it with a definition consistent with the 2015 rule a broader definition could result in increased cost of compliance or increased capital costs for construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities 

in april 2020 the us district court in montana vacated nationwide permit 12 “nwp 12” which authorizes the placement of fill material in “waters of the united states” for utility line activities as long as certain best management practices are implemented the decision was ultimately appealed to the united states supreme court which partially reversed the district court’s decision temporarily reinstating nwp 12 for all projects except the keystone xl oil pipeline the united states army corps of engineers subsequently reissued its nationwide permit authorizations on january 13 2021 by dividing the nwp that authorizes utility line activities nwp 12 into three separate nwps that address the differences in how different utility line projects are constructed the substances they convey and the different standards and best management practices that help ensure those nwps authorize only those activities that have no more than minimal adverse environmental effects a challenge of the 2021 authorization is currently pending before the us district court in montana and the plaintiffs request the court vacate and remand the 2021 authorization also a petition has been filed with the united states army corps of engineers asking it to revoke the 2021 authorization the biden administration could repeal or replace the 2021 authorization in a subsequent rulemaking the repeal vacatur revocation or replacement of the 2021 authorization could impact pipeline construction and maintenance activities 

as part of our emergency response activities we have used aqueous film forming foam “afff” containing per and polyfluoroalkyl substances “pfas” chemicals as a vapor and fire suppressant at this time afffs containing pfas are the only proven foams that can prevent and control a flammable petroleumbased liquid fire involving a large storage tank or tank containment area 

in may 2016 epa issued lifetime health advisory levels “hals” and health effects support documents for two pfas substances  perfluorooctanoic acid “pfoa” and perfluorooctane sulfonate “pfos” then in february 2019 epa issued a pfas action plan identifying actions it is planning to take to study and regulate various pfas chemicals epa identified that it would evaluate among other actions 1 proposing national drinking water standards for pfoa and pfos 2 develop cleanup recommendations for pfoa and pfos 3 evaluate listing pfoa and pfos as hazardous substances under cercla and 4 conduct toxicity assessments for other pfas chemicals epa did not issue any further regulations for pfas under the trump administration in october 2021 epa updated the 2019 pfas action plan the biden administration has drafted a proposed rule that would designate variants of pfas as cercla hazardous substances additional pfas regulation could include the designation of pfas as a rcra hazardous waste andor the establishment of national drinking water standards congress may 

also take further action to regulate pfas we cannot currently predict the impact of potential statutes or regulations on our operations or remediation costs 

in addition many states are actively proposing and adopting legislation and regulations relating to the use of afffs containing pfas additionally many states are using epa hals for pfos and pfoa and some states are adopting and proposing statespecific drinking water and cleanup standards for various pfas including but not limited to pfos and pfoa we cannot currently predict the impact of these regulations on our liquidity financial position or results of operations 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of usts containing regulated substances 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain convenience stores and other locations where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the applicable state laws and regulations a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

vehicle and fuel requirements 

fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles 

the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” establishes corporate average fuel economy “cafe” standards for passenger cars and light trucks in addition epa establishes carbon dioxide “co2” emission standards for passenger cars and light trucks at the direction of president biden in his executive order setting a goal that 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030 be zero emission vehicles epa and nhtsa in 2021 issued separate proposed rules setting more stringent requirements for reductions through model year 2026 nhtsa’s proposed amended cafe standards would increase in stringency from model year 2023 levels by eight percent per year over model years 20242026 epa’s revised model year 20232026 co2 emission standards which were finalized in december 2021 result in average fuel economy of 40 mpg in model year 2026 higher cafe and co2 emission standards for cars and light trucks reduce demand for our transportation fuels 

in addition california may establish per its clean air act waiver authority different standards that could apply in multiple states epa has proposed a rule that would reinstate california’s waiver for its advanced clean car program which includes requirements for zero emission vehicle sales through 2025 california’s governor has also issued an executive order requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles in the state be zeroemission by 2035 other states have issued or may issue zero emission vehicle mandates 

renewable fuels standards and low carbon fuel standards 

pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the eisa congress established a renewable fuel standard “rfs” program that requires annual volumes of renewable fuel be blended into domestic transportation fuel the statutory volumes apply through calendar year 2022 after which epa is required to set the annual volumes in accordance with statutory factors when epa promulgates the annual renewable fuel volume obligations epa may reduce the amount of renewable fuel that must be blended using its waiver or reset authority 

in its most recent annual rulemaking epa has proposed the annual renewable fuel standards for the years 2021 and 2022 and has also proposed reopening the renewable fuel standards for 2020 given the unique and unprecedented conditions caused by the covid pandemic because the 2020 and 2021 standards would be promulgated afterthefact epa is setting the standards to align with actual renewable fuel volumes for 2022 epa is proposing standards above the original 2020 standards epa is also proposing to add in a supplemental 500 million gallon total renewable fuel obligation to address the dc circuit court’s 

remand of the 2016 annual renewable fuel standards the supplemental 500milliongallon obligation would be split between 2022 and 2023 

epa’s policy on granting small refinery exemption petitions has changed under the biden administration in december 2021 epa proposed to deny 65 small refinery exemption petitions currently pending before the agency in addition epa is reevaluating 31 small refinery exemptions that had been granted for compliance year 2018 after the dc circuit court remanded the decisions to epa for further consideration under its new policy epa may reverse its original decision and deny these 31 petitions all these actions – the increase in 2022 standards the 2016 supplemental volume epa’s reversal of exemptions previously granted to us or other refiners – could result in a decrease in the rin bank an increase in the price of rins or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend any of which could increase mpc’s rfs cost of compliance 

there is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of most rins sold on the open market we have developed a rin integrity program to vet the rins that we purchase and we incur costs to audit rin generators nevertheless if any of the rins that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be invalid we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid rins 

in addition to the federal renewable fuel standards certain states have or are considering promulgation of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards for example california began implementing its lcfs in january 2011 in september 2015 the carb approved the readoption of the lcfs which became effective on january 1 2016 to address procedural deficiencies in the way the original regulation was adopted the lcfs was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030 we incur costs to comply with lcfs programs and these costs may increase if the cost of lcfs credits increases 

in sum the rfs has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use we may experience a decrease in demand for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced by renewable fuels demand for our refined products also may decrease as a result of low carbon fuel standard programs or electric vehicle mandates 

safety matters 

we are subject to oversight pursuant to the federal occupational safety and health act as amended “osh act” as well as comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers we believe that we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with regulations promulgated pursuant to the osh act including general industry standards recordkeeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 

we are also subject at regulated facilities to the occupational safety and health administration’s process safety management “psm” and epa’s risk management program “rmp” requirements which are intended to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic reactive flammable or explosive chemicals the application of these regulations can result in increased compliance expenditures 

in general we expect industry and regulatory safety standards to become more stringent over time resulting in increased compliance expenditures while these expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time we do not expect such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the dot has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design construction operation maintenance inspection and management of our pipeline assets these regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies these regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans 

tribal lands 

various federal agencies including epa and the department of the interior along with certain native american tribes promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on native american tribal lands where we operate these regulations include such matters as lease provisions drilling and production requirements and standards to protect environmental quality and cultural resources in addition each native american tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal state and local statutes and regulations these laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on native american tribal lands and impact the viability of or prevent or delay our ability to conduct our operations on such lands 

trademarks patents and licenses 

our marathon and arco trademarks are material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole in general we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of knowhow rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations 

human capital

compensation and benefits 

to ensure we are offering competitive pay packages in our recruitment and retention efforts we annually benchmark compensation including base salaries bonus levels and longterm incentive targets our annual bonus program is a critical component of our compensation as it provides individual rewards for mpc’s achievement against preset financial and esg goals encouraging a sense of employee ownership employees in our executivelevel pay grades as well as senior leaders and most midlevel leaders are eligible to receive longterm incentive awards to align their compensation to the interests of shareholders 

we offer comprehensive benefits including medical dental and vision insurance for our employees their spouses or domestic partners and their dependents we also provide retirement programs life insurance education assistance family assistance shortterm disability and paid vacation and sick time in addition we provide generous paid parental leave benefits for birth mothers and nonbirth parents and parents who both work for the company are each eligible for the benefit further we have a substantial accrual cap for vacation banks and also award a significant number of college and trade school scholarships to the high school senior children of our employees through the marathon petroleum scholars program both fulltime and parttime employees are eligible for these benefits 

inclusion 

our companywide diversity equity and inclusion dei program is guided by a dedicated dei team led by our vice president talent acquisition and diversity equity  inclusion and supported by leadership companywide our program is based on our fourpillar dei strategy of building awareness increasing representation ensuring success and measurement and accountability we have employee networks focusing on six populations asian black hispanic veterans women and lgbtq our employee networks have approximately 60 chapters across the company and all networks encourage ally membership this broad support extends also to our leaders throughout mpc with each employee network represented by two active executive sponsors the sponsors form several counsels that meet regularly to share updates gain alignment build deeper connections across networks and pursue collaboration ideas our employee networks not only provide opportunities for our employees to make meaningful and supportive connections but they also serve a significant role in our dei strategy 

safety 

we are committed to safe operations to protect the health and safety of our employees contractors and communities our commitment to safe operations is reflected in our safety systems design our wellmaintained equipment and by learning from our incidents part of our effort to promote safety includes our operational excellence management system which expands on the rc14001® scope incorporates a plandocheckact continual improvement cycle and aligns with iso 9001 incorporating quality and an increased stakeholder and process focus together these components of our safety management system provide 

us with a comprehensive approach to managing risks and preventing incidents illnesses and fatalities additionally our annual cash bonus program metrics includes several employee process and environmental safety metrics 

in 2021 mpc continued to run its critical operations and facilities safely through the ongoing pandemic in addition to covid19 protection measures implemented in 2020 eg masking social distancing barriers etc mpc promoted vaccinations through education campaigns and onsite clinics thousands of employees were inoculated at vaccine points of distribution set up onsite or through collaborative efforts with local public health clinics as a result of these measures mpc was able to welcome most nonessential employees back into the workplace in the spring of 2021 we continue to monitor the situation and adapt our covid protocols as appropriate

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline we have in the past been adversely affected by certain of and may in the future be affected by these risks you should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized 

business and operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material and adverse effect on our business and on general economic financial and business conditions 

the covid19 pandemic and existing covid19 mitigation measures continue to have adverse effects on global travel and economic activity and consequently demand for the petroleum products that we manufacture sell transport and store significant uncertainty remains as to the extent to which further resurgences in the virus the emergence of new variants and waning vaccine effectiveness may spur future actions by individuals governments and the private sector to stem the spread of the virus refinery utilization rates and refined product demand—particularly with respect to jet fuel—remain below historical levels 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact global economic conditions our business and the business of our customers suppliers and other counterparties will depend largely on future developments that remain uncertain and cannot be predicted such as the length and severity of the pandemic the social economic and epidemiological effects of covid19 mitigation measures the extent to which individuals acquire and retain immunity emerging virus variants and how those new variants of the disease affect the human body and general economic conditions 

new or additional mitigation measures required by national state or local governments such as vaccine or testing mandates may result in increased operating costs increased employee attrition and difficulty in securing future workforce needs and may adversely affect discretionary and business travel 

additionally the continuation of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risks identified in this form 10k which in turn could further materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks 

we may be negatively impacted by inflation 

increases in inflation may have an adverse effect on us current and future inflationary effects may be driven by among other things supply chain disruptions and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies continuing increases in inflation could impact the commodity markets generally the overall demand for our products our costs for feedstocks labor material and services and the margins we are able to realize on our products and services all of which could have an adverse impact on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows inflation may also result in higher interest rates which in turn would result in higher interest expense related to our variable rate indebtedness and any borrowings we undertake to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins which are dependent on factors beyond our control 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products historically refining and marketing margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil and other feedstocks the prices of feedstocks and the prices at which we can sell our refined products fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market factors that are beyond our control including 

• worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for feedstocks and refined products 

• transportation infrastructure cost and availability 

• operation levels of other refineries in our markets 

• the development by competitors of new refining or renewable conversion capacity 

• natural gas and electricity supply costs 

• political instability threatened or actual terrorist incidents armed conflict or other global political or economic conditions 

• local weather conditions and 

• the occurrence of other risks described herein 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we generally purchase our feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks can have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products can have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing margins have in the past and may in the future lead us to reduce the amount of refined products we produce which may reduce our revenues income from operations and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures impair the carrying value of our assets such as property plant and equipment inventory or goodwill and require us to reevaluate practices regarding our repurchase activity and dividends 

legal technological political and scientific developments regarding emissions fuel efficiency and alternative fuel vehicles may decrease demand for petroleumbased transportation fuels 

developments aimed at reducing vehicle emissions increasing vehicle efficiency or reducing the sale of new petroleumfueled vehicles may decrease the demand and may increase the cost for our transportation fuels in march 2020 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and the us department of transportation’s national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” released the final safer affordable fuelefficient “safe” vehicles rule setting corporate average fuel economy “cafe” and carbon dioxide “co2” standards for model years 2021 through 2026 passenger cars and light trucks the final rule increased the stringency of cafe and co2 emission standards by 15 percent each year from model years 2021 through 2026 in 2020 california’s governor issued an executive order requiring all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zeroemission by 2035 other jurisdictions have issued or considered issuing similar mandates and we expect this trend will continue 

moreover consumer acceptance and market penetration of electric hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles continues to increase in 2021 several automobile manufacturers jointly announced their shared goal that 4050 of their new vehicle sales be battery electric fuel cell or plugin hybrid vehicles by 2030 other automobile manufacturers have similar or more aggressive goals with respect to vehicle electrification 

together these trends and developments have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on sales of our petroleumbased transportation fuels which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

our operations are subject to business interruptions such as scheduled and unscheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases power outages severe weather labor disputes acts of terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters these types of incidents adversely affect our operations and may result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment impaired ability to manufacture our products environmental pollution and substantial losses we have experienced certain of these incidents in the past 

for assets located near populated areas the level of damage resulting from such an incident could be greater in addition we operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive waters where tanker pipeline rail car and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups certain of our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by tanker or barge mplx operates a fleet of boats and barges to 

transport light products heavy oils crude oil renewable fuels chemicals and feedstocks to and from refineries and terminals owned by mpc transportation and storage of crude oil other feedstocks and refined products over and adjacent to water involves inherent risk and subjects us to the provisions of the opa90 and state laws in us coastal and great lakes states and states bordering inland waterways on which we operate as well as international laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate if we are unable to promptly and adequately contain any accident or discharge involving tankers pipelines rail cars or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil other feedstocks or refined products we may be subject to substantial liability in addition the service providers contracted to aid us in a discharge response may be unavailable due to weather conditions governmental regulations or other local or global events 

damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

we are increasingly dependent on the performance of our information technology systems and those of our thirdparty business partners and service providers 

we are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and those of our thirdparty business partners and service providers for the safe and effective operation of our business we rely on such systems to process transmit and store electronic information including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee customer and investor data and to manage or support a variety of business processes including our supply chain pipeline operations gathering and processing operations credit card payments and authorizations at certain of our customers’ retail outlets financial transactions banking and numerous other processes and transactions 

our systems and those of our thirdparty business partners and service providers are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and attacks including ransomware and other malware and phishing and social engineering schemes which can compromise our ability to operate and the confidentiality availability and integrity of data in our systems or those of our thirdparty business partners and service providers these and other cybersecurity threats may originate with criminal attackers statesponsored actors or employee error or malfeasance because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to disable or degrade systems continuously evolve and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated and can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond in a timely manner we and our thirdparty business partners and service providers are subject to the risk of cyberattacks 

our cybersecurity and infrastructure protection technologies disaster recovery plans and systems employee training and vendor risk management may not be sufficient to defend us against all unauthorized attempts to access our information or impact our systems we and our thirdparty vendors and service providers have been and may in the future be subject to cybersecurity events of varying degrees to date the impacts of prior events have not had a material adverse effect on us 

cybersecurity events involving our information technology systems or those of our thirdparty business partners and service providers can result in theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential financial data regulated personally identifiable information intellectual property and other information give rise to remediation or other expenses result in litigation claims and increased regulatory review or scrutiny reduce our customers’ willingness to do business with us disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers and subject us to litigation and legal liability under international us federal and state laws any of such results could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the availability and cost of renewable identification numbers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the eisa congress established a renewable fuel standard “rfs” program that requires annual volumes of renewable fuel be blended into domestic transportation fuel a renewable identification number “rin” is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins we cannot predict the future prices of rins rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors including epa regulations the availability of rins for purchase and levels of transportation fuels produced which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter additionally the status of epa rfs exemptions may impact the price of rins epas policy on granting certain rfs exemptions has changed under the biden administration and some previously granted exemptions have been the subject of legal proceedings that may ultimately result in the reversal of past exemptions epa’s reversal of exemptions previously granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the rin bank an increase in the price of rins or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend any of which could increase mpc’s rfs cost of compliance there is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of most rins sold on the open market we have developed a rin integrity program to vet the rins that we purchase and we incur costs to audit rin generators nevertheless if any of the rins that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be invalid we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid rins see item 1 business – regulatory matters for additional information on these and other regulatory compliance matters 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks own their own retail sites or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum products we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks our competitors include multinational integrated major oil companies that can obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production competitors that produce crude oil are at times better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

we also compete with other companies for customers for our refined petroleum products the independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily marathonbranded outlets and the direct dealer locations we supply compete with other convenience store chains outlets owned or operated by integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling transportation fuels and merchandise at very competitive prices nontraditional transportation fuel retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market the loss of market share by those who operate our branded outlets and the direct dealer locations we supply could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted or limited because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions 

in particular pipelines or railroads provide a nearly exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries a prolonged interruption material reduction or cessation of service of such a pipeline or railway whether due to private party or governmental action or other reason or any other prolonged disruption of the ability of the trucks pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries can adversely affect us 

a significant decrease in oil and natural gas production in mplx’s areas of operation may adversely affect mplx’s business financial condition results of operations and cash available for distribution to its unitholders including mpc 

a significant portion of mplx’s operations is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production the production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers will naturally decline over time which means that mplx’s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of mplx’s facilities mplx must continually obtain new oil natural gas ngl and refined product supplies which depend in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its system capacity as needed 

we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of mplx’s operations the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline in addition we have no control over producers or their production decisions which are affected by demand prevailing and projected energy prices drilling costs operational challenges access to downstream markets the level of reserves geological considerations governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital reductions in exploration or production activity in mplx’s areas of operations could lead to reduced throughput on its pipelines and utilization rates of its facilities 

decreases in energy prices can lead to decreases in drilling activity production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves the prices for oil natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond our control including global and local demand production levels changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications imports and exports seasonality and weather conditions economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations sustained periods of low prices can result in producers deciding to limit their oil and gas drilling operations which can substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil natural gas and ngls to mplx’s facilities and adversely affect their revenues and cash available for distribution to us 

this impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of mplx’s commoditybased contracts which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and ngl prices than its feebased contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a btu equivalent basis than ngl products in addition the purchase and resale of natural gas and ngls in the ordinary course exposes our midstream operations to volatility in natural gas or ngl prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of production processes also the significant volatility in natural gas ngl and oil prices could adversely impact mplx’s unit price thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital such impacts could adversely impact mplx’s ability to execute its long‑term organic growth projects satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels and may also result in noncash impairments of longlived assets or goodwill or otherthantemporary noncash impairments of our equity method investments 

severe weather events and other climate conditions may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations 

our facilities are subject to acute physical risks such as floods hurricaneforce winds wildfires and winter storms and chronic physical risks such as sealevel rise or water shortages for example in 2021 our galveston bay refinery was adversely affected by winter storm uri and our garyville refinery was adversely affected by hurricane ida the occurrence of these and similar events have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our assets and operations we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to protect our assets and operations from such physical risks and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks to the extent such severe weather events or other climate conditions increase in frequency and severity we may be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from our operations outside the united states and generally to worldwide political and economic developments 

we operate and sell some of our products outside the united states our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets including economic instability restrictions on the transfer of funds duties and tariffs transportation delays difficulty in enforcing contractual provisions import and export controls changes in governmental policies political and social unrest security issues involving key personnel and changing regulatory and political environments future outbreaks of infectious diseases could affect demand for refined products and economic conditions generally as the covid19 pandemic has done over the last two years in addition the deterioration of trade relationships modification or termination of existing trade agreements imposition of new economic sanctions against russia or other countries and the effects of potential responsive countermeasures or increased taxes border adjustments or tariffs can make international business operations more costly which can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are required to comply with us and international laws and regulations including those involving antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

more broadly political and economic factors in global markets could impact crude oil and other feedstock supplies and could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east russia or elsewhere or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other countries lower levels of economic activity often result in a decline in energy consumption which may cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products ngls and natural gas additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability for example the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products ngls natural gas or the conduct of business in or with certain foreign countries in addition foreign countries could restrict imports investments or commercial transactions or revoke or refuse to grant necessary permits 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our reliance on our joint venture partners and their financial condition and our joint venture partners may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours 

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners our joint venture partners may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations failure by us or an entity in which we have an interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

terrorist attacks or other targeted operational disruptions may affect our facilities or those of our customers and suppliers 

refining gathering and processing pipeline and terminal infrastructure and other energy assets may be the subject of terrorist attacks or other targeted operational disruptions any attack or targeted disruption of our operations those of our customers or in some cases those of other energy industry participants could have a material and adverse effect on our business similarly any similar event that severely disrupts the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

financial risks 

we have significant debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile or downgrade of our credit ratings a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

at december 31 2021 our total debt obligations for borrowed money and finance lease obligations were 2595 billion including 1891 billion of obligations of mplx and its subsidiaries we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to changing economic regulatory and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry 

• limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and 

• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases dividends and other purposes 

a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant any changes in our credit capacity or credit profile could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant variations in the market prices of crude oil and refined products can affect our financial performance 

during 2020 there were significant variations in the market prices of products held in our inventories those significant variations required us to record either inventory valuation charges or benefits to reflect the valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect on our financial performance in addition a sustained period of low crude oil prices may also result in significant financial constraints on certain producers from which we acquire our crude oil which could result in long term crude oil supply constraints for our business such conditions could also result in an increased risk that our customers and other counterparties may be unable to fully fulfill their obligations in a timely manner or at all 

a continued period of economic slowdown or recession or a protracted period of depressed prices for crude oil or refined petroleum products could have significant and adverse consequences for our financial condition and the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other counterparties and could diminish our liquidity trigger additional impairments and negatively affect our ability to obtain adequate crude oil volumes and to market certain of our products at favorable prices or at all 

our working capital cash flows and liquidity can be significantly affected by decreases in commodity prices 

payment terms for our crude oil purchases are generally longer than the terms we extend to our customers for refined product sales as a result the payables for our crude oil purchases are proportionally larger than the receivables for our refined product sales due to this net payables position a decrease in commodity prices generally results in a use of working capital and given the significant volume of crude oil that we purchase the impact can materially affect our working capital cash flows and liquidity 

increases in interest rates could adversely impact our share price our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make dividends at our intended levels 

our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate as a result future interest rates on our debt could be higher than current levels causing our financing costs to increase accordingly in addition we may in the future refinance outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with fixedrate indebtedness interest rates payable on fixedrate indebtedness typically are higher than the shortterm variable interest rates that we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also have other fixedrate indebtedness that we may need or desire to refinance in the future at or prior to the applicable stated maturity a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to make dividends at our intended levels 

the expected phase out of libor could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and could cause our interest expense to increase 

a portion of our borrowing capacity and outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor or fca announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 subsequently on march 5 2021 ice benchmark administration limited the entity that calculates and publishes libor or iba and fca made public statements regarding the future cessation of libor according to the fca iba will permanently cease to publish each of the libor settings on either december 31 2021 

or june 30 2023 iba did not identify any successor administrator in its announcement the announced final publication date for 1week and 2month libor settings and all settings for nonusd libor was december 31 2021 the announced final publication date for overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month libor settings is june 30 2023 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after such end dates and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication or representativeness of libor beyond such end dates the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee is seeking to replace us dollar libor with a newly created index the secured overnight financing rate or sofr calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities 

the agreements that govern our variable rate indebtedness contain customary transition and fallback provisions in contemplation of the cessation of libor nevertheless at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere may have on libor other benchmarks or floating rate indebtedness uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks furthermore the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the market value of the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our floating rate indebtedness to be materially different than expected and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance such floating rate indebtedness or raise future indebtedness on a cost effective basis restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases cybersecurity breaches or other incidents involving our assets or operations can reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become further impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

we accounted for the andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded to our balance sheet at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill 

as of december 31 2021 our balance sheet reflected 83 billion and 22 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets respectively we have in the past recorded significant impairments of our goodwill to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes further impaired we may be required to incur additional material noncash charges relating to such impairment our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment 

large capital projects can take years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns 

we have several large capital projects underway including the activities associated with the conversion of the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility delays in completing capital projects or making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

• denials of delays in receiving or revocations of requisite regulatory approvals or permits 

• unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor whether due to inflation or other factors 

• disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials 

• adverse weather conditions natural disasters or other events such as equipment malfunctions explosions fires or spills affecting our facilities or those of vendors or suppliers 

• shortages of sufficiently skilled labor or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages 

• marketrelated increases in a project’s debt or equity financing costs 

• global supply chain disruptions 

• nonperformance by or disputes with vendors suppliers contractors or subcontractors and 

• delays due to citizen state or local political or activist pressure 

moreover our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project for instance if we build a new pipeline the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project if at all 

any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs to meet the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws or regulations future environmental laws and regulations may impact our current business plans and reduce demand for our products and services 

our business is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our business laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following 

• the emission or discharge of materials into the environment 

• solid and hazardous waste management 

• the regulatory classification of materials currently or formerly used in our business 

• pollution prevention 

• climate change and greenhouse gas emissions 

• characteristics and composition of transportation fuels including the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into transportation fuels 

• public and employee safety and health 

• permitting 

• inherently safer technology and 

• facility security 

the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources production processes and subsequent judicial interpretation of such laws and regulations we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations we have incurred and may in the future incur liability for personal injury property damage natural resource damage or cleanup costs due to alleged contamination andor exposure to chemicals such as benzene and mtbe there is also increased regulatory interest in per and polyfluoroalkyl substances “pfas” which we expect will lead to increased monitoring and remediation obligations and potential liability related thereto such expenditures could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas production activities could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

while we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations we do provide gathering processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result of such operations our refineries are also supplied in part with crude oil produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs a range of federal state and local laws and regulations currently govern or in some cases prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions stricter laws regulations and permitting processes may be enacted in the future if federal state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing or other oil and gas production activities are enacted or expanded such efforts could impede oil and gas production increase producers’ cost of compliance and result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather process and fractionate 

the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in mplx units could be subject to potential legislative judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations possibly on a retroactive basis 

the present us federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships including mplx or an investment in mplx common units may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial interpretation at any time from time to time the president and members of the us congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing us federal income tax 

laws that would affect publicly traded partnerships including proposals that would eliminate mplx’s ability to qualify for partnership tax treatment 

for example the biden administration’s may 2021 budget proposal included a proposal that would have repealed the application of the qualifying income exception to partnerships with income and gains from activities relating to fossil fuels for taxable years beginning after 2026 

we are unable to predict whether any such changes will ultimately be enacted any modification to the us federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for mplx to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes or increase the amount of taxes payable by unitholders in publicly traded partnerships 

climate change and greenhouse gas emission regulation could affect our operations energy consumption patterns and regulatory obligations any of which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

currently multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas including carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides and other emissions are in various phases of consideration promulgation or implementation these include actions to develop international federal regional or statewide programs which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for refined products requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments 

for example california and washington have enacted capandtrade programs other states are proposing or have already promulgated low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector if we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

certain municipalities have also proposed or enacted restrictions on the installation of natural gas appliances and infrastructure in new residential or commercial construction which could affect demand for the natural gas that mplx transports and stores 

regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy increasing concerns about climate change and carbon intensity have also resulted in societal concerns and a number of international and national measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions additional stricter measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition 

international climate changerelated efforts such as the 2015 united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations though the united states had withdrawn from the paris agreement president biden issued an executive order recommitting the united states to the paris agreement on january 20 2021 president biden also issued an executive order on climate change in which he announced putting the us on a path to achieve netzero carbon emissions economywide by 2050 the executive order also calls for the federal government to pause oil and gas leasing on federal lands reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible and requires federal permitting decisions to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in a second executive order president biden reestablished a working group to develop the social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane the social cost of carbon and social cost of methane can be used to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations a higher social cost of carbon could support more stringent greenhouse gas emission regulation 

the scope and magnitude of the changes to us climate change strategy under the biden administration and future administrations however remain subject to the passage of legislation and interpretation and action of federal and state regulatory bodies therefore the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time 

energy companies are subject to increasing environmental and climaterelated litigation 

governmental and other entities in various us states have filed lawsuits against various energy companies including us the lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions additionally private plaintiffs and government parties have undertaken efforts to shut down energy assets by challenging operating permits the validity of easements or the compliance with easement conditions for example the dakota access pipeline in which mplx has a minority interest has been subject to litigation in which plaintiffs sought a permanent shutdown of the pipeline there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these types of proceedings as well as their potential effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies 

we operate and develop our business with the expectation that regulations and societal sentiment will continue to enable the development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels however policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation storage and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups additionally societal sentiment regarding carbonbased fuels may adversely impact our reputation and ability to attract and retain employees 

the approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry and concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions downstream of pipeline operations our expansion or construction projects may not be completed on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost we also may be required to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with the design and installation of our facilities due to their location and the surrounding terrain we may be required to install additional facilities incur additional capital and operating expenditures or experience interruptions in or impairments of our operations to the extent that the facilities are not designed or installed correctly 

increasing attention to environmental social and governance matters may impact our business and financial results 

in recent years increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to environmental social and governance “esg” matters in public discourse and the investment community a number of advocacy groups both domestically and internationally have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote esgrelated change at public companies including but not limited to through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers pension funds universities and other members of the investing community these activities include increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change and energy transition matters such as promoting the use of substitutes to fossil fuel products and encouraging the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as pressuring lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with fossil fuel companies if this were to continue it could have a material adverse effect on our access to capital members of the investment community have begun to screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance including practices related to ghg emission reduction and energy transition strategies if we are unable to find economically viable as well as publicly acceptable solutions that reduce our ghg emissions reduce ghg intensity for new and existing projects increase our nonfossil fuel product portfolio andor address other esgrelated stakeholder concerns our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

regulatory and other requirements concerning the transportation of crude oil and other commodities by rail may cause increases in transportation costs or limit the amount of crude oil that we can transport by rail 

we rely on a variety of systems to transport crude oil including rail rail transportation is regulated by federal state and local authorities new regulations or changes in existing regulations could result in increased compliance expenditures for example in 2015 the us department of transportation issued new standards and regulations applicable to crudebyrail transportation enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for highhazard flammable trains these or other regulations that require the reduction of volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail change the design or standards for rail cars used to transport the crude oil we purchase change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil or require any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering north american crude oil by rail could increase the time required to move crude oil from production areas to our refineries increase the cost of rail transportation and decrease the efficiency of shipments of crude oil by rail within our operations any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations including those of mplx and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials have in the past and may in the future pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 3762 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements approximately 2545 refinery employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that were set to expire on january 31 2022 but have been extended by mutual agreement subject to a 24hour written notice of cancellation by either party the remaining 1217 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2026 these agreements may be renewed at an increased cost to us in addition we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements for example approximately 170 workers at our st paul park refinery were on strike from january 21 2021 until july 5 2021 any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition california requires refinery owners to pay prevailing wages to contract craft workers and restricts refiners’ ability to hire qualified employees to a limited pool of applicants legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages higher labor costs and an increased risk that contract workers become joint employees which could trigger bargaining issues and wage and benefit consequences especially during critical maintenance and construction periods 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a master limited partnership which may expose us to certain legal liabilities 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx a master limited partnership our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if foreign investment in us or mplx exceeds certain levels we could be prohibited from operating vessels engaged in us coastwise trade which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920 collectively the “maritime laws” generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens among other requirements to establish citizenship entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by us citizens if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters or otherwise in us coastwise trade such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations could be disrupted if we are unable to maintain or obtain real property rights required for our business 

we do not own all of the land on which certain of our assets are located particularly our midstream assets but rather obtain the rights to construct and operate such assets on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time therefore we are subject to the possibility of more burdensome terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if our leases rightsofway or other property rights lapse terminate or are reduced or it is determined that we do not have valid leases rightsofway or other property rights for example a portion of the tesoro high plains pipeline in north dakota remains shut down following delays in renewing a rightofway necessary for the operation of a section of the pipeline any loss of or reduction in our real property rights including loss or reduction due to legal governmental or other actions or difficulty renewing leases rightofway agreements or permits on satisfactory terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain of our facilities are located on native american tribal lands and are subject to various federal and tribal approvals and regulations which can increase our costs and delay or prevent our efforts to conduct planned operations 

various federal agencies within the us department of the interior particularly the bureau of indian affairs along with each native american tribe regulate natural gas and oil operations on native american tribal lands in addition each native american tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal state and local statutes and regulations these tribal laws and regulations include various taxes fees requirements to employ native american tribal members and other conditions that apply to operators and contractors conducting operations on native american tribal lands persons conducting operations on tribal lands are generally subject to the native american tribal court system in addition if our relationships with any of the relevant native american tribes were to deteriorate we could face significant risks to our ability to continue operations on native american tribal lands one or more of these factors may increase our cost of doing business on native american tribal lands and impact the viability of or prevent or delay our ability to conduct operations on such lands 

the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be to the extent permitted by law the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our shareholders 

our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for 

• any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of mpc 

• any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of mpc to mpc or its stockholders 

• any action asserting a claim against mpc arising pursuant to any provision of the general corporation law of the state of delaware mpc’s restated certificate of incorporation any preferred stock designation or the bylaws of mpc or 

• any other action asserting a claim against mpc or any director or officer of mpc that is governed by or subject to the internal affairs doctrine for choice of law purposes 

the forum selection provision may restrict a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim against us or directors or officers of mpc in a forum that it finds favorable which may discourage stockholders from bringing such claims at all alternatively if a court were to find the forum selection provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in another forum which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations however the forum selection provision does not apply to any claims actions or proceedings arising under the securities act or the exchange act 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 

• providing that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board 

• providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms 

• providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies 

• limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders 

• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders 

• establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 

• establishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation 

• providing that our directors may only be removed for cause 

• authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management thereby protecting the continuity of our management or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us and 

• authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock 

strategic transaction risks 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the speedway sale 

on may 14 2021 we completed the sale of speedway our companyowned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business to 7eleven we may not realize some or all the expected benefits of the sale for example we may be unable to utilize fully the proceeds from the sale as anticipated or capture the value we expect from our plans to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our shareholders following the completion of the sale our diversification of revenue sources diminished and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be subject to increased volatility as a result 

general risk factors 

significant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies as a result stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

future acquisitions will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and may present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows 

future transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present risks which may include among others 

• inaccurate assumptions about future synergies revenues capital expenditures and operating costs 

• an inability to successfully integrate or a delay in the successful integration of assets or businesses we acquire 

• a decrease in our liquidity resulting from using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions 

• a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions 

• the assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate 

• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired business and

dakota access pipeline 

mplx holds a 919 percent indirect interest in a joint venture “dakota access” that owns and operates the dakota access pipeline and energy transfer crude oil pipeline projects collectively referred to as the bakken pipeline system or dapl in 2020 the us district court for the district of columbia the “ddc” ordered the us army corps of engineers “army corps” which granted permits and an easement for the bakken pipeline system to prepare an environmental impact statement “eis” relating to an easement under lake oahe in north dakota the ddc later vacated the easement the eis is currently expected to be completed in the second half of 2022 

in may 2021 the ddc denied a renewed request for an injunction to shut down the pipeline while the eis is being prepared in june 2021 the ddc issued an order dismissing without prejudice the tribes’ claims against the dakota access pipeline the litigation could be reopened or new litigation challenging the eis once completed could be filed the pipeline remains operational 

mplx has entered into a contingent equity contribution agreement whereby it along with the other joint venture owners in the bakken pipeline system has agreed to make equity contributions to the joint venture upon certain events occurring to allow the entities that own and operate the bakken pipeline system to satisfy their senior note payment obligations the senior notes were issued to repay amounts owed by the pipeline companies to fund the cost of construction of the bakken pipeline system if the pipeline were temporarily shut down mplx would have to contribute its 919 percent pro rata share of funds required to pay interest accruing on the notes and any portion of the principal that matures while the pipeline is shutdown mplx also expects to contribute its 919 percent pro rata share of any costs to remediate any deficiencies to reinstate the permit andor return the pipeline into operation if the vacatur of the easement permit results in a permanent shutdown of the pipeline mplx would have to contribute its 919 percent pro rata share of the cost to redeem the bonds including the 1 redemption premium required pursuant to the indenture governing the notes and any accrued and unpaid interest as of december 31 2021 our maximum potential undiscounted payments under the contingent equity contribution agreement were approximately 230 million 

tesoro high plains pipeline 

in july 2020 tesoro high plains pipeline company llc “thpp” a subsidiary of mplx received a notification of trespass determination from the bureau of indian affairs “bia” relating to a portion of the tesoro high plains pipeline that crosses the fort berthold reservation in north dakota the notification demanded the immediate cessation of pipeline operations and assessed trespass damages of approximately 187 million on appeal the assistant secretary  indian affairs vacated the bia’s trespass order and remanded to the regional director for the bia great plains region to issue a new decision based on specified criteria on december 15 2020 the regional director of the bia issued a new trespass notice to thpp finding that thpp was in trespass and assessing trespass damages of approximately 4 million including interest the order also required that thpp immediately cease and desist use of the portion of the pipeline that crosses the property at issue thpp has complied with the regional director’s december 15 2020 notice in march 2021 thpp received a copy of an order purporting to vacate all orders related to thpp’s alleged trespass issued by the bia between july 2 2020 and january 14 2021 the order directs the regional director of the bia to reconsider the issue of thpp’s alleged trespass and issue a new order if necessary after all interested parties have had an opportunity to be heard on april 23 2021 thpp filed a lawsuit in the district of north dakota against the united states of america the us department of the interior and the bia together the us government parties” challenging the march order purporting to vacate all previous orders related to thpp’s alleged trespass on february 8 2022 the us government parties filed their answer to thpp’s suit asserting counterclaims for trespass and ejectment the us government parties claim thpp is in continued trespass with respect to the pipeline and seek disgorgement of pipeline profits from june 1 2013 to present removal of the pipeline and remediation we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these counterclaims we continue to work towards a settlement of this matter with holders of the property rights at issue 

martinez refinery 

we are currently negotiating the settlement of 99 novs received from the bay area air quality management district “baaqmd” the novs were issued from 2011 to 2018 and allege violations of air quality regulations and the idled martinez refinery’s air permit we cannot currently estimate the timing of the resolution of these matters 

on july 18 2016 the us department of justice “doj” lodged a complaint on behalf of epa and a consent decree in the us court for the western district of texas among other things the consent decree required that the martinez refinery meet certain annual emission limits for nox by july 1 2018 in 2018 trmc informed epa that it would need additional time to satisfy requirements of the consent decree in 2019 trmc and the united states entered into an agreement to amend the consent decree to resolve these issues in light of the actions to strategically reposition the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility we are renegotiating the consent decree modification subject to final approval by the court we expect that contingent 

on trmc completing the conversion of the martinez refinery to renewable diesel production the renegotiated consent decree modification will no longer require the installation of a selective catalytic reduction system to control nox emissions from the nowidled fluid catalytic cracking unit but will result in an increased civil penalty 

gathering and processing 

as previously disclosed mplx has been negotiating with epa with respect to multiple alleged violations of the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants by the chapita coyote wash island river bend and wonsits valley compressor stations in utah we are in the process of finalizing a settlement with epa pursuant to which mplx expects to pay a cash penalty in excess of 300000 and enter into a consent decree covering mplx gas plants and compressor stations located in utah north dakota and wyoming we expect the settlement will be finalized later in 2022

all statements in this section other than statements of historical fact are forwardlooking statements that are inherently uncertain see “disclosures regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements the following information concerning our business results of operations and financial condition should also be read in conjunction with the information included under item 1 business item 1a risk factors and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

executive summary 

business update 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 we continued to see recovery in the environment in which our business operates albeit in some markets and regions more or less than others the increased availability of vaccinations and the reductions in travel and business restrictions appeared to drive increased economic activity including the opening of many businesses and schools as well as more inperson interaction broadly demand for gasoline and distillates excluding jet fuel have returned to near 2019 prepandemic levels permanent remote work and teleconferencing arrangements may continue to impact demand for our refined products while we have seen improved results through 2021 we are unable to predict the potential effects that further resurgences of covid19 may have on our financial position and results 

in response to this business environment we continue to focus on the following priorities for our business 

strengthen competitive position of assets 

we are committed to positioning our assets so that we are a leader in operational financial and sustainability performance and are evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio our goal is that each individual asset generates freecashflow back to the business and contributes to shareholder returns with our investments we are focused on high returning projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness of our portfolio including our investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves 

improve commercial performance 

we are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection new approaches in the commercial space to be more dynamic amidst changing market conditions and achieving technology improvements to advance our commercial performance a nearterm focus has been securing advantaged renewable feedstocks as we continue to advance our renewable fuels production capabilities this includes exploring joint venture opportunities and strategic alliances within the renewable fuels value chain 

continued capital discipline and focus on lowcost culture 

we are committed to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs improving efficiency driving operational improvements and being disciplined in capital allocation this means lowering our costs in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be disciplined in every dollar we spend across our organization we look to optimize our portfolio of investment opportunities to ensure efficient deployment of capital focusing on projects with the highest returns 

in connection with our commitment to lower cost and strengthen the competitive position of our assets in the third quarter of 2020 we announced strategic actions to lay a foundation for longterm success including plans to optimize our assets and structurally lower costs in 2021 and beyond these actions included indefinitely idling the gallup refinery initiating actions to strategically reposition the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and the approval of an involuntary workforce reduction plan our results for the year ended december 31 2021 reflect the favorable effects from these cost reduction actions 

many uncertainties remain with respect to covid19 and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from covid19 and how quickly the us and economies around the world can recover once the pandemic ultimately subsides however the adverse impact of the economic effects on mpc have been and may continue to be significant 

commitment to sustainability 

our approach to sustainability spans the environmental social and governance dimensions of our business that means strengthening resiliency by lowering the carbon intensity and conserving natural resources innovating for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies and embedding sustainability in decisionmaking and in how we engage our people and many stakeholders specifically we established a 2030 target to reduce our absolute scope 3  category 11 ghg emissions by 15 below 2019 levels additionally mplx established a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity by 75 below 2016 levels the reduction target applies to mplx’s natural gas gathering and processing operations and represents an expansion of the existing 2025 target established in 2020 to reduce methane emissions intensity by 50 below 2016 levels 

strategic updates 

on february 2 2022 we announced our board of directors approved an incremental 50 billion share repurchase authorization the authorization has no expiration date as of december 31 2021 mpc had 527 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorizations prior to this additional authorization 

on december 14 2021 we finalized the formation of a joint venture with archerdanielsmidland company “adm” for the production of soybean oil to supply rapidly growing demand for renewable diesel fuel the joint venture which is named green bison soy processing llc will own and operate a soybean processing complex in spiritwood north dakota with adm owning 75 percent of the joint venture and mpc owning 25 percent when complete in 2023 the spiritwood facility will source and process local soybeans and supply the resulting soybean oil exclusively to mpc the spiritwood complex is expected to produce approximately 600 million pounds of refined soybean oil annually enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable diesel per year 

on may 14 2021 we completed the sale of speedway our companyowned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business to 7eleven for cash proceeds of 2138 billion this transaction resulted in a pretax gain of 1168 billion 802 billion after income taxes after deducting the book value of the net assets and certain other adjustments mpc remains committed to executing its plan to use the net proceeds from the sale to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders 

in connection with the speedway sale our board of directors approved an additional 71 billion share repurchase authorization bringing total share repurchase authorizations to 100 billion prior to the june tender offer discussed below 

• during 2021 including the modified dutch auction tender offer discussed below mpc repurchased approximately 76 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately 465 billion of cash with an additional 85 million of cash paid in the first quarter of 2022 in connection with the settlement of certain late december repurchases 

• during the second quarter of 2021 mpc completed a modified dutch auction tender offer purchasing 15573365 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of 6300 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 981 million excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer 

during 2021 we reduced debt through the following actions 

• on december 2 2021 all of the 125 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of mpcs 45 senior notes due may 2023 and the 850 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of mpc’s 475 senior notes due december 2023 including the portion of such notes for which andeavor llc was the obligor were redeemed at a price equal to par plus a makewhole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the redemption date mpc funded the redemption amount with cash on hand 

• in june 2021we redeemed all of the 300 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of mpc’s 5125 senior notes due april 2024 at a price equal to 100854 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the redemption date 

• in may 2021 we repaid all outstanding commercial paper borrowings which along with cash had been used to finance the fourth quarter 2020 repayments of two series of mpc’s senior notes in the aggregate total principal amount of 113 billion 

• on march 1 2021 we repaid the 1 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of mpc’s 5125 senior notes due march 2021 

on february 24 2021 we announced our plan to strategically reposition the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility converting the martinez facility from refining petroleum to manufacturing renewable fuels signals our strong commitment to producing a substantial level of lower carbonintensity fuels in california as envisioned the martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022 with pretreatment capabilities coming online in 2023 the facility is expected to be capable of producing approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023 

the dickinson north dakota renewable fuels facility began operations at the end of 2020 and reached full design operating capacity in the second quarter of 2021 the facility has the capacity to produce 184 million gallons per year of renewable diesel from corn oil soybean oil fats and greases the produced renewable diesel generates federal rins and lcfs credits when sold in california or similar markets these instruments are used to help meet our renewable fuel standard and lcfs compliance obligations as a petroleum fuel producer 

effective tax rate 

our effective income tax rate is affected by the weighting of income from our wholly owned operations versus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests additionally tax rate differences can arise from nonforecasted discrete items during operating environments when refining margins approximate historical averages we generally expect our effective tax rate to be between 18 percent and 21 percent excluding discrete tax items a reconciliation of the statutory tax rate of 21 percent to our 

effective tax rate of 9 percent for the period ended december 31 2021 is included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note14 

results 

select results for continuing operations for 2021 and 2020 are reflected in the following table 



a includes lifo liquidation charge of 561 million for 2020 

b 2021 includes impairment expenses related to longlived assets and equity method investments 2020 includes impairments of goodwill equity method investments and longlived assets 

c 2020 restructuring expenses include 195 million for exit costs related to the martinez and gallup refineries and 172 million of employee separation costs 

d 2020 includes costs incurred in connection with the midstream strategic review 

select results for discontinued operations are reflected in the following table 



a costs related to the speedway separation 

the following table includes net income loss per diluted share data 



net income attributable to mpc increased 1956 billion or 3037 per diluted share in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the gain on the sale of speedway the absence of impairment expenses and a lifo liquidation charge and increases in average refined product sales prices and volumes partially offset by a partial period of income from discontinued operations due to the sale of the speedway business on may 14 2021 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5 for additional information on discontinued operations 

refer to the results of operations section for a discussion of financial results by segment for the three years ended december 31 2021 

mplx 

we received limited partner distributions of 216 billion and 179 billion from mplx during 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in 2021 is primarily due to a special distribution amount of 05750 per common unit in the third quarter of 2021 we owned approximately 647 million mplx common units at december 31 2021 with a market value of 1916 billion based on the december 31 2021 closing unit price of 2959 on january 25 2022 mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of 07050 per common unit which was paid february 14 2022 as a result mplx made distributions totaling 715 million to its common unitholders mpc’s portion of this distribution was approximately 456 million 

during the year ended december 31 2021 mplx repurchased 23 million common units at an average cost per unit of 2752 and paid 630 million of cash as of december 31 2021 337 million remained available under the authorization for future repurchases

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining  marketing margin refining operating costs refining planned turnarounds distribution costs depreciation expenses and refinery throughputs our total refining capacity was 2887 mbpcd 2874 mbpcd and 3067 mbpcd as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

our refining  marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants we calculate gulf coast midcontinent and west coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products the following will be used for these crackspread calculations 

• the gulf coast crack spread uses three barrels of meh crude producing two barrels of usgc cbob gasoline and one barrel of usgc ulsd in the first quarter of 2021 we transitioned to meh crude from lls crude 

• the midcontinent crack spread uses three barrels of wti crude producing two barrels of chicago cbob gasoline and one barrel of chicago ulsd and 

• the west coast crack spread uses three barrels of ans crude producing two barrels of la carbob and one barrel of la carb diesel 

our refineries process a variety of sweet and sour grades of crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to the crude oils referenced in our gulf coast midcontinent and west coast crack spreads the amount of these discounts which we refer to as the sweet differential and the sour differential can vary significantly causing our refining  marketing margin to differ from blended crack spreads in general larger sweet and sour differentials will enhance our refining  marketing margin 

future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors as well as us energy policy 

the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions 



a crack spread based on 40 percent meh 40 percent wti and 20 percent ans with gulf coast midcontinent and west coast product pricing respectively and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged 

b sour crude oil basket consists of the following crudes ans argus sour crude index maya and western canadian select we assume approximately 50 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2022 will be sour crude 

c sweet crude oil basket consists of the following crudes bakken brent meh wticushing and wtimidland we assume approximately 50 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2022 will be sweet crude 

d this is consumption based exposure for our refining  marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our midstream segment 

in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sour differential and the sweet differential our refining  marketing margin is impacted by factors such as 

• the selling prices realized for refined products 

• the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed 

• our refinery yields 

• the cost of products purchased for resale 

• the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk 

• the potential impact of lcm adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices and 

• the potential impact of lifo liquidation charges due to drawdowns from historic inventory levels 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market costs of crude oil refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values at december 31 2021 market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

refining  marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refining operating costs and refining planned turnaround costs in addition to committed distribution costs changes in operating costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs refining planned turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery distribution costs primarily include longterm agreements with mplx as discussed below which are based on committed volumes and will negatively impact income from operations in periods when throughput or sales are lower or refineries are idled 

the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years 



we have various longterm feebased commercial agreements with mplx under these agreements mplx which is reported in our midstream segment provides transportation storage distribution and marketing services to our refining  marketing segment certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil refined products and other products certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets 

midstream 

our midstream segment transports stores distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for our refining  marketing segment the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines the profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges the profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals the profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products the profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our refining  marketing segment our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our refining  marketing segment 

as discussed above in the refining  marketing section mplx which is reported in our midstream segment has various longterm feebased commercial agreements related to services provided to our refining  marketing segment under these agreements mplx has received various commitments of minimum throughput storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines terminals and marine operations key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport store distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer 

driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

our midstream segment also gathers and processes natural gas and ngls ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers such prices also affect profitability 

results of operations 

the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 this discussion should be read in conjunction with item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 

consolidated results of operations 



a in accordance with discontinued operations accounting speedway sales to retail customers and net results are reflected in income from discontinued operations net of tax and refining  marketing intercompany sales to speedway are presented as thirdparty sales through the close of the sale on may 14 2021 

2021 compared to 2020 

net income attributable to mpc increased 1956 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the gain on the sale of speedway the absence of impairment expenses and a lifo liquidation charge and increases in average refined product sales 

prices and volumes partially offset by a partial period of income from discontinued operations due to the sale of the speedway business on may 14 2021 see segment results for additional information 

total revenues and other income increased 5190 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to 

• increased sales and other operating revenues of 5020 billion primarily due to increased average refined product sales prices of 080 per gallon or 65 percent and refined product sales volumes of 203 mbpd or 6 percent largely due to continuing economic recovery from the impact of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 

• increased income from equity method investments of 139 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of 132 billion in 2020 primarily driven by the effects of covid19 and the decline in commodity prices and 

• increased other income of 350 million primarily due to higher income on rin sales 

total costs and expenses increased 3535 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to 

• increased cost of revenues of 4428 billion primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes in addition to higher crude oil and refined product raw material costs partially offset by the absence of a lifo liquidation charge in 2020 of 561 million 

• decreased impairment expense of 843 billion due to impairments recorded for goodwill and longlived assets in 2020 primarily driven by the effects of covid19 and the decline in commodity prices in the prior year 

• decreased selling general and administrative expenses of 173 million mainly due to cost reductions realized from our 2020 workforce reduction and other cost control efforts and 

• decreased restructuring expenses of 367 million related to the idling of the martinez and gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction in 2020 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19 for additional information 

net interest and other financial costs increased 118 million largely due to debt retirement expenses related to the redemption of mpc senior notes and pension settlement losses of 75 million partially offset by decreased interest expense due to lower mplx and mpc borrowings we capitalized interest of 73 million in 2021 and 129 million in 2020 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 13 for further details 

we recorded a combined federal state and foreign income tax expense of 264 million for the year ended december 31 2021 which was lower than the tax computed at the us statutory rate primarily due to certain permanent tax benefits related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a change in benefit related to the net operating loss “nol” carryback provided under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” partially offset by state taxes we recorded a combined federal state and foreign income tax benefit of 243 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 which is lower than the tax computed at the us statutory rate primarily due to a significant amount of our pretax loss consisting of nontax deductible goodwill impairment charges partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the nol carryback provided under the cares act additionally our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in mplx but this benefit was lower for the year ended december 31 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by mplx see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 14 for further details 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 140 billion mainly due to an increase in mplx’s net income largely due to impairment expense recognized during 2020 

2020 compared to 2019 

net income attributable to mpc decreased 1246 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to impairment expenses for goodwill and longlived assets of 843 billion impairments of equity method investments of 132 billion decreased refined product sales volumes prices and margin a charge of 561 million to reflect a lifo liquidation in our crude oil and refined product inventories and restructuring expenses of 367 million these changes were partially offset by reduced operating costs and increased income from discontinued operations which represents the speedway business see segment results for additional information 

total revenues and other income decreased 4283 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• decreased sales and other operating revenues of 4137 billion primarily due to decreased refining  marketing segment refined product sales volumes which decreased 513 mbpd or 14 percent and lower average refined product sales prices which decreased 055 per gallon or 31 percent largely due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the covid19 pandemic 

• decreased income from equity method investments of 125 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of 132 billion primarily driven by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and the decline in commodity prices and 

• decreased net gain on disposal of assets of 208 million mainly due to the absence of 259 million of noncash gains related to obtaining equity investments in capline pipeline company llc and the andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019 this decrease was offset by net gains on disposal of assets in 2020 largely due to the sale of three asphalt terminals and other refining  marketing assets 

total costs and expenses decreased 2612 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• decreased cost of revenues of 3350 billion primarily due to reduced business operations and travel associated with the covid19 pandemic partially offset by increased cost of revenues of 561 million to reflect lifo liquidations for our crude oil and refined product inventories the costs of inventories in the historical lifo layers liquidated were higher than current costs which resulted in the lifo liquidation charge 

• impairment expense of 843 billion recorded in 2020 for goodwill and longlived assets of 739 billion and 103 billion respectively primarily driven by the effects of covid19 and the decline in commodity prices it also includes impairment of longlived assets primarily related to the repositioning of the martinez refinery compared to impairment expense of 120 billion recorded in 2019 primarily related to mplx goodwill associated with the andx gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the andeavor acquisition 

• decreased selling general and administrative expenses of 482 million mainly due to decreases in salaries and employeerelated expenses transactionrelated expenses credit card processing fees for brand customers and contract services expenses 

• restructuring expense of 367 million related to the idling of the martinez and gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19 for additional information and 

• increased other taxes of 107 million primarily due to increased property and environmental taxes of approximately 78 million and 69 million respectively property taxes increased in the current period mainly due to the absence of property tax refunds and tax exemptions received in 2019 and environmental taxes increased largely due to the reinstatement of the oil spill tax in 2020 which was not in effect for all of 2019 these increases were offset by a state tax refund and reduced payroll tax expenses 

net interest and other financial costs increased 136 million largely due to increased mpc borrowings and foreign currency exchange losses and decreased interest income we capitalized interest of 129 million in 2020 and 158 million in 2019 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 13 for further details 

provision for income taxes on continuing operations decreased 321 billion primarily due to decreased income before taxes of 1685 billion the effective tax rate of 18 percent in 2020 is lower than the us statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to a significant amount of our pretax loss consisting of nontax deductible goodwill impairment charges partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the expected nol carryback provided under the cares act additionally our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in mplx but this benefit was lower for the year ended december 31 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by mplx the effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the us statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 14 for further details 

noncontrolling interests decreased 769 million mainly due to mplx’s net loss primarily resulting from impairment expense recognized during 2020 

segment results 



our refining  marketing and midstream segment income loss from continuing operations was approximately 508 billion 148 billion and 645 billion for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

the following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment the benchmark crack spreads below do not reflect the market cost of rins necessary to meet epa renewable volume obligations for attributable products under the renewable fuel standard 



a the blended crack spreads for 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020 are weighted 40 percent of the usgc crack spread 40 percent of the midcontinent crack spread and 20 percent of the west coast crack spread the blended crack spreads for the first three quarters of 2020 and all of 2019 are weighted 38 percent of the usgc crack spread 38 percent of the midcontinent crack spread and 24 percent of the west coast crack spread these blends are based on mpc’s refining capacity by region in each period beginning in the first quarter of 2021 the prompt price for usgc was transitioned from lls to meh 

2021 compared to 2020 

refining  marketing segment revenues increased 4925 billion primarily due to increased average refined product sales prices of 080 per gallon and higher refined product sales volumes which increased 203 mbpd 

refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 91 percent during 2021 and net refinery throughputs increased 216 mbpd primarily due to continuing economic recovery from the impact of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 621 billion primarily driven by higher blended crack spreads 

refining  marketing margin excluding lifo liquidation charge was 1336 per barrel for 2021 compared to 896 per barrel for 2020 refining  marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput we estimate a net positive impact of 50 billion on refining  marketing margin primarily due to higher crack spreads our reported refining  marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices rin prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances direct dealer fuel margin and for 2020 a lifo liquidation charge of 561 million these factors had an estimated net positive impact on refining  marketing segment income from operations of approximately 700 million including the lifo liquidation charge in 2021 compared to 2020 

for the year ended december 31 2021 refining operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization and storm impacts were 513 billion this was a decrease of 241 million or 066 per barrel compared to the year ended december 31 2020 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic including idling portions of our refining capacity partially offset by an increase in energy costs largely as a result of higher natural gas prices 

distribution costs excluding depreciation and amortization were 515 billion and 508 billion for 2021 and 2020 respectively and include fees paid to mplx of 347 billion and 346 billion for 2021 and 2020 respectively on a per barrel basis distribution costs excluding depreciation and amortization decreased 033 due to increased throughput 

refining planned turnaround costs decreased 250 million or 031 per barrel due to the timing of turnaround activity and an increase in throughput 

depreciation and amortization per barrel decreased by 013 primarily due to an increase in throughput partially offset by an increase in costs 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 149 billion in 2021 and 606 million in 2020 and are included in refining  marketing margin the increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher weighted average rin costs 

2020 compared to 2019 

refining  marketing segment revenues decreased 4116 billion primarily due to lower refined product sales volumes which decreased 513 mbpd and decreased average refined product sales prices of 055 per gallon 

refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 82 percent during 2020 and net refinery throughputs decreased 529 mbpd primarily due to reducing throughputs during the covid19 pandemic 

refining  marketing segment income from operations decreased 805 billion primarily driven by lower blended crack spreads 

refining  marketing margin excluding lifo liquidation charge was 896 per barrel for 2020 compared to 1477 per barrel for 2019 refining  marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput we estimate a net negative impact of 975 billion on refining  marketing margin primarily due to lower crack spreads our reported refining  marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices rin prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances direct dealer fuel margin and for 2020 a lifo liquidation charge of 561 million for 2019 the refining  marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of 93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018 these factors had an estimated net positive impact on refining  marketing segment income from operations of approximately 800 million including the lifo liquidation charge in 2020 compared to 2019 

for the year ended december 31 2020 refining operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization were 537 billion this was a decrease of 106 billion and a per barrel increase of 002 due to lower refinery throughput compared to the year ended december 31 2019 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of covid19 including operating at lower throughput at our refineries and idling portions of our refining capacity net refinery throughput was 529 mbpd lower in 2020 

distribution costs excluding depreciation and amortization were 508 billion and 513 billion for 2020 and 2019 respectively and include fees paid to mplx of 346 billion and 322 billion for 2020 and 2019 respectively on a per barrel basis distribution costs excluding depreciation and amortization increased 085 primarily due to lower throughput partially offset by a decrease in costs 

refining planned turnaround costs increased 92 million or 023 per barrel due to the timing of turnaround activity and a decrease in throughput 

depreciation and amortization per barrel increased by 038 primarily due to a decrease in throughput and increased costs 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 606 million in 2020 and 356 million in 2019 and are included in refining  marketing margin the increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher weighted average rin costs partially offset by a decrease in our rin obligations

2021 compared to 2020 

midstream segment revenue and segment income from operations increased 118 billion and 353 million respectively results benefited from higher revenue primarily due to higher natural gas prices higher pipeline and terminal throughputs and lower operating expenses partially offset by a decrease in marine transportation fees 

2020 compared to 2019 

midstream segment revenue decreased 322 million primarily due to decreased demand for the products that we produce and transport due to macroeconomic conditions in 2020 in addition to lower natural gas prices 

in 2020 midstream segment income from operations increased 114 million mainly due to stable feebased earnings in the 2020 business environment contributions from organic growth projects and reduced operating expenses 

corporate 



a corporate costs consist primarily of mpc’s corporate administrative expenses and costs related to certain nonoperating assets except for corporate overhead expenses attributable to mplx which are included in the midstream segment 

2021 compared to 2020 

corporate expenses decreased 104 million in 2021 compared to 2020 largely due to cost reductions realized from our 2020 workforce reduction and other cost control efforts 

2020 compared to 2019 

corporate expenses decreased 33 million in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to decreased salaries and contract services expenses partially offset by increased expenses due to an information systems integration project 2020 and 2019 corporate expenses include expenses of 26 million and 28 million respectively which are no longer allocable to speedway due to discontinued operations accounting

nongaap financial measure 

management uses a financial measure to evaluate our operating performance that is calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with gaap we believe this nongaap financial measure is useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to its most comparable gaap financial measure it provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends this measure should not be considered a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the nongaap financial measure we use is as follows 

refining  marketing margin 

refining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes other items reflected in the table below 

reconciliation of refining  marketing income loss from operations to refining  marketing gross margin and refining  marketing margin 



a reflects the gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization of other related operations included in the refining  marketing segment and processing of credit card transactions on behalf of certain of our marketing customers net of other income

because of the alternatives available to us including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets and a commercial paper program we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm less than twelve months and longterm funding requirements including capital spending programs the repurchase of shares of our common stock dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies 

on may 14 2021 we completed the sale of speedway our companyowned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business to 7eleven for cash proceeds of 2138 billion this transaction resulted in a pretax gain of 1168 billion 802 billion after income taxes after deducting the book value of the net assets and certain other adjustments we utilized a portion of the speedway sale net proceeds to structurally reduce debt and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases the remaining proceeds are included in our liquidity as cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

during 2021 we reduced debt through the following actions 

• on december 2 2021 all of the 125 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of mpcs 45 senior notes due may 2023 and the 850 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of mpc’s 475 senior notes due december 

2023 including the portion of such notes for which andeavor llc was the obligor were redeemed at a price equal to par plus a makewhole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the redemption date mpc funded the redemption amount with cash on hand 

• in june 2021 we redeemed all of the 300 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of mpc’s 5125 senior notes due april 2024 at a price equal to 100854 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the redemption date 

• in may 2021 we repaid all outstanding commercial paper borrowings which along with cash had been used to finance the fourth quarter 2020 repayments of two series of mpc’s senior notes in the aggregate total principal amount of 113 billion 

• on march 1 2021 we repaid the 1 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of mpc’s 5125 senior notes due march 2021 

effective june 18 2021 we terminated our 10 billion unsecured 364day revolving credit facility due in september 2021 and on june 23 2021 we reduced the capacity under our trade receivables securitization facility from 750 million to 100 million on september 30 2021 we entered into a new trade receivables securitization facility which provides for committed borrowing and letter of credit issuing capacity of up to 100 million and uncommitted capacity up to 400 million this facility replaces our previous trade receivables securitization facility that expired on july 16 2021 

we have a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of 20 billion in commercial paper outstanding with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities at december 31 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program 

the mpc credit agreement and trade receivables facility contain representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types the financial covenant included in the mpc credit agreement requires us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization as defined in the mpc credit agreement of no greater than 065 to 100 other covenants restrict us andor certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the mpc credit agreement and our trade receivables facility including the financial covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 008 to 100 

our intention is to maintain an investmentgrade credit profile as of february 1 2022 the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt are as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investmentgrade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

the mpc credit agreement does not contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under such agreements and may limit our flexibility to obtain financing in the future including to refinance existing indebtedness in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investmentgrade levels could under certain circumstances impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22 for further discussion of our debt 

mplx 

mplx’s liquidity totaled 326 billion at december 31 2021 consisting of 



on september 3 2021 mplx redeemed at par value all of the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due september 2022 mplx primarily funded the redemption with borrowings under the mpc intercompany loan agreement 

the mplx credit agreement contains certain representations and warranties affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type the financial covenant requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the mplx credit agreement for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 50 to 10 or 55 to 10 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period other covenants restrict mplx andor certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2021 mplx was in compliance with the covenants including the financial covenant with a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 37 to 10 

our intention is to maintain an investmentgrade credit profile for mplx as of february 1 2022 the credit ratings on mplx’s senior unsecured debt are as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investmentgrade rating for mplx there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

the agreements governing mplx’s debt obligations do not contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that mplx credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of mplx senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under such agreements in addition a downgrade of mplx senior unsecured debt ratings to below investmentgrade levels may limit mplx’s ability to obtain future financing including to refinance existing indebtedness

capital requirements 

capital spending 

mpc’s capital investment plan for 2022 totals approximately 17 billion for capital projects and investments excluding capitalized interest potential acquisitions and mplx’s capital investment plan mpc’s 2022 capital investment plan includes all of the planned capital spending for refining  marketing and corporate as well as a portion of the planned capital investments for midstream the remainder of the planned capital spending for midstream reflects the capital investment plan for mplx we continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant the 2022 capital investment plan for mpc and mplx and capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below 



a capital expenditures include changes in capital accruals 

b excludes capitalized interest of 68 million 106 million and 137 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the 2022 capital investment plan excludes capitalized interest 

refining  marketing 

the refining  marketing segment’s forecasted 2022 capital spending and investments is approximately 163 billion this amount includes approximately 800 million of growth capital for renewables projects primarily the martinez facility conversion and 525 million of growth capital focused on ongoing projects such as the star project and projects that we expect will help us reduce future operating costs maintenance capital is expected to be approximately 300 million which is essential to maintain the safety integrity and reliability of our assets 

major capital projects completed over the last three years have focused on refinery optimization production of higher value products increased capacity to upgrade residual fuel oil and expanded export capacity we also focused on projects such as the martinez facility conversion the star project at our galveston bay refinery which is scheduled to complete in 2022 and projects expected to reduce future operating costs 

midstream 

mplx’s capital investment plan includes approximately 700 million of organic growth capital 140 million of maintenance capital and a 60 million investment in unconsolidated affiliates for the repayment of mplx’s 919 percent indirect share of the bakken pipeline joint venture’s debt due in 2022 the growth capital plan is directed towards logistics projects in support of mpc’s martinez renewable fuels project projects in the permian and bakken basins and investments in the permian basin supporting the bangl and whistler pipelines these longhaul ngl and natural gas logistics systems transport product to the us gulf coast other growth projects include the addition of approximately 200 mmcfd of processing capacity in the delaware basin in the permian to meet increasing producer customer demand and 68 mbpd of deethanization capacity in the marcellus both of which are expected to be completed in 2022 

major capital projects over the last three years included investments for the development of natural gas and natural gas liquids infrastructure to support mplx’s producer customers primarily in the marcellus utica and permian regions and development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects 

the remaining midstream segment’s forecasted 2022 capital spend excluding mplx is approximately 10 million which primarily relates to investments in equity affiliates 

corporate and other 

the 2022 capital forecast includes approximately 100 million to support corporate activities major projects over the last three years included upgrades to information technology systems 

share repurchases 

since january 1 2012 our board of directors has approved 2505 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of 1978 billion of our common stock leaving approximately 527 billion available for repurchases as of december 31 2021 on february 2 2022 we announced our board of directors approved an incremental 50 billion share repurchase authorization the authorization has no expiration date the table below summarizes our total share repurchases see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans 



we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market repurchases negotiated block transactions tender offers accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing and amount of future repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

mplx unit repurchases 

during the year ended december 31 2021 mplx repurchased 23 million common units at an average cost per unit of 2752 and paid 630 million of cash as of december 31 2021 337 million remained under the authorization for future repurchases 

mplx may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market repurchases negotiated block transactions tender offers accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and repurchases may be initiated suspended or discontinued at any time the repurchase authorization has no expiration date 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6 for further discussion of the mplx unit repurchase program 

cash commitments 

contractual obligations 

we have purchase commitments primarily consisting of obligations to purchase and transport crude oil used in our refining operations as of december 31 2021 we had purchase obligations for crude oil of 1513 billion with 1466 billion payable within 12 months and crude oil transportation obligations of 728 billion with 451 million payable within 12 months these contracts include variable price arrangements for purposes of this disclosure we have estimated prices to be paid primarily based on futures curves for the commodities to the extent available our contractual obligations do not include our contractual obligations to mplx under various feebased commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2021 we have noncancelable obligations to acquire property plant and equipment of 565 million with 543 million payable within 12 months 

at december 31 2021 we have aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt of 2535 billion with 500 million payable within 12 months see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22 for additional information on our debt 

our other contractual obligations primarily consist of finance and operating leases and pension and postretirement obligations for which additional information is included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 28 and 26 respectively 

other cash commitments 

on january 27 2022 we announced our board of directors approved a 058 per share dividend payable march 10 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 16 2022 

we may from time to time repurchase our senior notes and preferred units in the open market in tender offers in privatelynegotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate 

transactions with related parties 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 9 for discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers 

our environmental expenditures including nonregulatory expenditures for each of the last three years were 



a based on the american petroleum institute’s definition of environmental expenditures 

b these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves where permissible but exclude noncash provisions recorded for environmental remediation 

we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 8 percent 6 percent and 12 percent of capital expenditures for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively excluding acquisitions our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 32 million or 1 percent of total planned capital expenditures in 2022 actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 

for more information on environmental regulations that impact us or could impact us see item 1 business – regulatory matters and item 1a risk factors 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often 

referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

• level 1 – observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 

• level 2 – observable marketbased inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data these are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date 

• level 3 – unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value 

valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 20 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 

• assessment of impairment of longlived assets 

• assessment of impairment of intangible assets 

• assessment of impairment of goodwill 

• assessment of impairment of equity method investments 

• recorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions and 

• recorded values of derivative instruments 

impairment assessments of longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions including 

• future operating performance  our estimates of future operating performance are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors which include among other things industrywide capacity our planned utilization rate enduser demand capital expenditures and economic conditions such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews 

• future volumes  our estimates of future refinery pipeline throughput and natural gas and natural gas liquid processing volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our refining  marketing and midstream segments operations personnel assumptions about the effects of the covid19 pandemic on our future volumes are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic which is difficult to forecast 

• discount rate commensurate with the risks involved  we apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors including market and economic conditions operational risk regulatory risk and political risk this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions if possible a higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows 

• future capital requirements  these are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts 

assumptions about the effects of the covid19 pandemic and the macroeconomic environment are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the macroeconomic environment which is difficult to forecast we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a weakened outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes a significant reduction in natural gas or natural gas liquids processed a significant reduction in refining margins other changes to contracts or 

changes in the regulatory environment the following sections detail our critical accounting estimates related to impairment assessments for longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments 

longlived asset impairment assessments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value 

goodwill impairment assessments 

unlike longlived assets goodwill is subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing at the reporting unit level a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value without exceeding the recorded amount of goodwill 

at december 31 2021 mpc had four reporting units with goodwill totaling approximately 826 billion the majority of this balance is comprised of the midstream reporting units including 11 billion for the mplx crude gathering reporting unit and 66 billion for the mplx transportation  storage reporting unit for the annual impairment assessment as of november 30 2021 management performed only a qualitative assessment for two reporting units as we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value a quantitative assessment was last performed on these reporting units at march 31 2020 which indicated fair value exceeded carrying value by approximately 52 and 270 percent a quantitative assessment was performed for the remaining two reporting units which resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by 23 percent and 51 percent the fair values of the reporting units were determined based on applying both a discounted cash flow method or income approach as well as a market approach an increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of november 30 2021 for refining  marketing reporting units significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units’ fair value included estimates of future cash flows and market information for comparable assets for midstream reporting units which comprise the majority of the goodwill balance significant assumptions that were used to estimate the reporting units fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management’s best estimates of the discount rate as well as estimates of future cash flows which are impacted primarily by producer customers’ development plans which impact future volumes and capital requirements if estimates for future cash flows which are impacted by future margins on products produced or sold future volumes and capital requirements were to decline the overall reporting units’ fair values would decrease resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 

equity method investment impairment assessment 

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value at december 31 2021 we had 541 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 16 for additional information on our equity method investments see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 18 for additional information on our goodwill and intangibles including a table summarizing our recorded goodwill by segment 

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 20 additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

variable interest entities 

we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests variable interests can be contractual ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie’s assets when we conclude that we hold an interest in 

a vie we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated 

significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie we evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest andor if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group we continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions 

changes in the design or nature of the activities of a vie or our involvement with a vie may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity’s status as a vie andor our status as the primary beneficiary such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization this could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary which would have a significant impact on our financial statements 

variable interest entities are discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 

• the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations 

• the expected longterm return on plan assets 

• the rate of future increases in compensation levels 

• health care cost projections and 

• the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations 

we utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for each of our pension plans and retiree health and welfare based on the projected benefit payment patterns of each individual plan the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuaries’ discount rate models these models calculate an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using yield curves derived from aa or higher corporate bond yields the yield curves represent a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher from a recognized rating agency and generally only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 300 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 290 percent for our pension plans and 275 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 104 million and 23 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 13 million and 1 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 50 percent equity securities and 50 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness we used the 575 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2021 defined benefit pension expense after evaluating activity in the capital markets along with the current and projected plan investments we increased the asset rate of return for our primary plan to 600 percent effective for 2022 decreasing the 600 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percentage points would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 7 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

we utilized the 2021 mortality tables from the us society of actuaries 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 26 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

as discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2021 we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 20 and 21 for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

refining  marketing 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures swaps and options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts but we also enter into overthecounter swaps options and overthecounter options we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

midstream 

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond mplx’s control mplx may at times use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to economically hedge commodity price risk a portion of mplx’s profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of purchasing and selling ngls and natural gas at indexrelated prices to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of drilling by mplx producer customers such prices also indirectly affect profitability mplx may enter into derivative contracts which are primarily swaps traded on the otc market as well as fixed price forward contracts mplx’s risk management policy does not allow it to enter into speculative positions with its derivative contracts execution of mplx’s hedge strategy and the continuous monitoring of commodity markets and its open derivative positions are carried out by its hedge committee comprised of members of senior management 

to mitigate mplx’s cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of ngls it may use ngl derivative swap contracts a small portion of its ngl price exposure may be managed by using crude oil contracts to mitigate mplx’s cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas it may use natural gas derivative swap contracts taking into account the partial offset of its long and short natural gas positions resulting from normal operating activities 

mplx would be exposed to additional commodity risk in certain situations such as if producers under‑deliver or over‑deliver products or if processing facilities are operated in different recovery modes in the event that mplx has derivative positions in excess of the product delivered or expected to be delivered the excess derivative positions may be terminated 

mplx management conducts a standard credit review on counterparties to derivative contracts and it has provided the counterparties with a guaranty as credit support for its obligations mplx uses standardized agreements that allow for offset of certain positive and negative exposures in the event of default or other terminating events including bankruptcy 

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the following table includes the composition of net lossesgains on our commodity derivative positions for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 21 for additional information on our open derivative positions at december 31 2021 

sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2021 is provided in the following table 



we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2021 would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

our use of fixed or variablerate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk fixed rate debt such as our senior notes exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates or that our current fixed rate debt may be higher than the current market variablerate debt such as borrowings under our revolving credit facilities exposes us to shortterm changes in market rates that impact our interest expense a portion of our borrowing capacity and outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor or fca announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 subsequently on march 5 2021 ice benchmark administration limited the entity that calculates and publishes libor or iba and fca made public statements regarding the future cessation of libor according to the fca iba will permanently cease to publish each of the libor settings on either december 31 2021 or june 30 2023 iba did not identify any successor administrator in its announcement the announced final publication date for 1week and 2month libor settings and all settings for nonusd libor was december 31 2021 the announced final publication date for overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month libor settings is june 30 2023 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after such end dates and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication or representativeness of libor beyond such end dates the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee is seeking to replace us dollar libor with a newly created index the secured overnight financing rate or sofr calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities the agreements that govern our variable rate indebtedness contain customary transition and fallback provisions in contemplation of the cessation of libor we continue to monitor developments regarding the cessation of libor and transition to an alternate benchmark rate but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position results of operation or cash flows nevertheless at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate or 

the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere may have on libor other benchmarks or floating rate indebtedness see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22 for additional information on our debt 

sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint change in interest rates on longterm debt including the portion classified as current and excluding finance leases as of december 31 2021 is provided in the following table the fair value of cash and cash equivalents receivables accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and in addition to shortterm investments which are recorded at fair value are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the shortterm maturity of the instruments accordingly these instruments are excluded from the table 



a fair value was based on market prices where available or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities 

b assumes a 100basis point decrease in the weighted average yieldtomaturity at december 31 2021 

c assumes a 100basispoint change in interest rates the change in net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2021 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 20 for additional information on the fair value of our debt 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars and some of our sales of finished products denominated in mexican pesos derivatives utilized to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations were not material in 2021 

counterparty risk 

mplx is subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment by its customers to whom it provides services leases assets or sells natural gas or ngls mplx believes that certain contracts where it sells ngls and acts as its producer customers’ agent would allow it to pass those losses through to its customers thus reducing its risk when it is selling ngls and acting as its producer customers’ agent its credit exposure related to these customers is represented by the value of its trade receivables or lease receivables where exposed to credit risk mplx analyzes the customer’s financial condition prior to entering into a transaction or agreement establishes credit terms and monitors the appropriateness of these terms on an ongoing basis in the event of a customer default mplx may sustain a loss and its cash receipts could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative contracts our credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date outstanding instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements should the creditworthiness of one or more of our counterparties decline our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party in the event of a counterparty default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted

 item 1 business 

overview 

marathon petroleum corporation “mpc” has over 130 years of experience in the energy business and is the largest independent petroleum product refining marketing retail and midstream business in the united states we operate the nations largest refining system with approximately 29 million barrels per day of crude oil refining capacity and believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers in the united states we also operate speedway the second largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states which we have agreed to sell to 7eleven inc “7eleven” for 21 billion in cash subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash debt and working capital at closing and certain other items we distribute our refined products through one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges in addition our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and ngls from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets 

our operations consist of two reportable operating segments refining  marketing and midstream each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers 

• refining  marketing – refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our refineries in the gulf coast midcontinent and west coast regions of the united states purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through transportation storage distribution and marketing services provided largely by our midstream segment we sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally to buyers on the spot market to independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily marathon ® branded outlets through longterm supply contracts with direct dealers who operate locations mainly under the arco ® brand and to approximately 3800 speedway locations 

• midstream – transports stores distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for the refining  marketing segment via refining logistics assets pipelines terminals towboats and barges gathers processes and transports natural gas and gathers transports fractionates stores and markets ngls the midstream segment primarily reflects the results of mplx lp “mplx” mplx is a diversified largecap master limited partnership “mlp” formed in 2012 that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets and provides fuels distribution services as of december 31 2020 we owned the general partner of mplx and approximately 62 percent of the outstanding mplx common units 

corporate history and structure 

mpc was incorporated in delaware on november 9 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of marathon oil corporation “marathon oil” on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its refining marketing  transportation business into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil on june 30 2011 our common stock trades on the nyse under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

on october 1 2018 we acquired andeavor andeavor shareholders received in the aggregate approximately 2398 million shares of mpc common stock valued at 198 billion and 35 billion in cash andeavor was a highly integrated marketing logistics and refining company operating primarily in the western and midcontinent united states our acquisition of andeavor in 2018 substantially increased our geographic diversification and the scale of our assets which provides increased opportunities to optimize our system 

recent developments 

strategic actions to enhance shareholder value 

speedway sale 

on august 2 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell speedway our companyowned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business to 7eleven for 21 billion in cash 

table of contents 

subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash debt and working capital at closing and certain other items the taxable transaction is targeted to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021 subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals this transaction is expected to result in aftertax cash proceeds of approximately 165 billion we expect to use the proceeds from the sale to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders 

in connection with the agreement to sell speedway we have agreed to enter into certain ancillary agreements including a 15year fuel supply agreement associated with 7eleven or its subsidiaries depending on the fuel demand of speedway and other factors to be set forth in the fuel supply agreement further we expect incremental opportunities over time to supply 7elevens remaining business as 7elevens existing arrangements mature and as new locations are added in connection with its announced us and canada growth strategy 

as a result of the agreement to sell speedway its results are reported separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented and its assets and liabilities have been reclassified in our consolidated balance sheets to assets and liabilities held for sale prior to presentation of speedway as discontinued operations speedway and our retained direct dealer business were the two reporting units within our retail segment beginning with the third quarter of 2020 the direct dealer business is managed as part of the refining  marketing segment the results of the refining  marketing segment have been retrospectively adjusted to include the results of the direct dealer business in all periods presented 

as a result of our agreement to sell speedway the following changes in our basis of presentation have occurred 

• in accordance with asc 205 discontinued operations intersegment sales from our refining  marketing segment to speedway are no longer eliminated as intercompany transactions and are now presented within sales and other operating revenue since we will continue to supply fuel to speedway subsequent to the sale to 7eleven all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change 

• beginning august 2 2020 in accordance with asc 360 property plant and equipment we ceased recording depreciation and amortization for speedway’s property plant and equipment finitelived intangible assets and right of use lease assets 

midstream review 

on march 18 2020 we announced that mpc’s board of directors unanimously decided to maintain mpc’s current midstream structure with mpc remaining through a wholly owned subsidiary the general partner of mplx this decision concluded a comprehensive evaluation led by a special committee of the board that included extensive input from multiple external advisors and significant feedback from investors

refined product yields 

the following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years including production from the refineries acquired in the andeavor acquisition from october 1 2018 forward 



table of contents 

crude oil supply 

we obtain the crude oil we refine through negotiated term contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market our term contracts generally have marketrelated pricing provisions the following table provides information on our sources of crude oil for each of the last three years it includes crude sourced for the refineries acquired in the andeavor acquisition from october 1 2018 forward the crude oil sourced outside of north america was acquired from various foreign national oil companies production companies and trading companies 



our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks and distribute our refined products through a variety of channels including pipelines trucks railcars ships and barges 

renewable fuels 

during 2020 we completed the conversion of our dickinson north dakota refinery into an approximately 184 million gallons per year renewable diesel facility 

we also progressed activities associated with the conversion of the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility including applying for permits advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers and beginning detailed engineering activities as envisioned the martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022 with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023 on february 24 2021 mpc’s board of directors approved these plans

table of contents 

the following table sets forth our refined product sales volumes by product group for each of the last three years including sales from the refineries acquired in the andeavor acquisition from october 1 2018 forward 



refined product sales destined for export 

we sell gasoline distillates and asphalt for export primarily out of our garyville galveston bay anacortes los angeles and kenai refineries the following table sets forth our refined product sales destined for export by product group for the past three years including sales from the refineries acquired in the andeavor acquisition from october 1 2018 forward 



gasoline and distillates 

we sell gasoline gasoline blendstocks and distillates including no 1 and no 2 fuel oils jet fuel kerosene and diesel fuel to wholesale customers marathonbranded jobbers direct dealers and in the spot market in addition we sell diesel fuel and gasoline for export to international customers the demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months 

feedstocks and petrochemicals 

we are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and petrochemicals product availability varies by refinery and includes among others propylene naphtha butane xylene benzene alkylate cumene raffinate toluene and platformate we market these products domestically to customers in the chemical agricultural and fuelblending industries in addition we produce fuelgrade coke at our garyville detroit galveston bay and los angeles refineries which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications and anodegrade coke at our los angeles and robinson refineries in addition to calcined coke at our los angeles refinery which are both used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry

propane 

we produce propane at all of our refineries propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles our propane sales are split approximately 80 percent and 20 percent between the home heating market and petrochemical consumers respectively 

table of contents 

heavy fuel oil 

we produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components including slurry at all of our refineries heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering fuel industries though there are other more specialized uses of the product 

terminals and transportation 

we transport store and distribute crude oil feedstocks and refined products through pipelines terminals and marine fleets owned by mplx and third parties in our market areas 

we own a fleet of transport trucks and trailers for the movement of refined products and crude oil in addition we maintain a fleet of leased and owned railcars for the movement and storage of refined products 

the locations and detailed information about our refining  marketing assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of refined products based upon company data as reported in the “the oil  gas journal 2020 worldwide refinery survey” we ranked first among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity 

we compete in four dis tinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale including exports spot branded and retail distribution our marketing operations compete with numerous other independent marketers integrated oil companies and highvolume retailers we compete with companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market and refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded independent entrepreneurs in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and retail consumers 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils ans wti and lls crude oils and other market structure impacts also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for our refining  marketing segment for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

midstream 

the midstream segment primarily includes the operations of mplx our sponsored mlp and certain related operations retained by mpc 

mplx 

mplx owns and operates a network of crude oil natural gas and refined product pipelines and has joint ownership interests in other crude oil and refined products pipelines mplx also owns and operates light products terminals storage assets and maintains a fleet of owned and leased towboats and barges mplx’s assets also include natural gas gathering systems and natural gas processing and ngl fractionation complexes 

table of contents 

mpcretained midstream assets and investments 

we have ownership interests in several crude oil and refined products pipeline systems and pipeline companies and have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures through our investment in crowley coastal partners 

the locations and detailed information about our midstream assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

our midstream operations face competition for natural gas gathering crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services in obtaining unprocessed ngls for gathering transportation and fractionation and in marketing our products and services competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants operating efficiency and reliability residue gas and ngl market connectivity the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered and the fees charged for the services supplied to the customer competition for oil supplies is based primarily on the price and scope of services location of gatheringtransportation and storage facilities and connectivity to the best priced markets competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of fractionation capacity proximity to supply and industry marketing centers the fees charged for fractionation services and operating efficiency and reliability of service competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and ngls is based primarily on price credit and market connectivity in addition certain of our midstream operations are subject to rate regulation which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

our midstream segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and ngls and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year 

regulatory matters 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations including those relating to the protection of the environment such laws and regulations include among others the clean air act “caa” with respect to air emissions the clean water act “cwa” with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized 

for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsenvironmental matters and compliance costs for additional information regarding regulatory risks see item 1a risk factors 

air 

greenhouse gas emissions 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to greenhouse gas emissions climate change and climate adaptation will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review discussion or implementation reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities iii capture the emissions from our facilities and iv administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments 

in january 2021 president biden announced that the united states was rejoining the 2015 paris un climate change conference agreement effective february 19 2021 president biden also issued an executive order on climate change in which he announced putting the us on a path to achieve netzero carbon emissions economywide by 2050 the executive order also calls for the federal government to pause oil and gas leasing on federal lands reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible and requires federal permitting decisions to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions 

table of contents 

and climate change in a second executive order president biden reestablished a working group to develop the social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane the social cost of carbon and social cost of methane can be used to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations a higher social cost of carbon could support more stringent greenhouse gas emission regulation 

states are becoming active in regulating greenhouse gas emissions these measures may include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions these measures may also include lowcarbon fuel standards such as the california program or a state carbon tax these measures could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented for example the california state legislature enacted ab 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 percent reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in sb 32 compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a marketbased credit system much of the compliance costs associated with these california regulations are ultimately passed on to the consumer in the form of higher fuel costs states are increasingly announcing aspirational goals to be netzero carbon emissions by a certain date through both legislation and executive orders to date these states have not provided significant details as to achievement of these goals however meeting these aspirations will require a reduction in fossil fuel combustion andor a mechanism to capture greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as a result we cannot currently predict the impact of these potential regulations on our liquidity financial position or results of operations 

other air emissions 

in 2015 united states environmental protection agency “epa” finalized a revision to the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for ozone the epa lowered the primary ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to 70 ppb in december 2020 the epa published a rule maintaining this standard designation as a nonattainment area could result in increased costs associated with or result in cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities or could require nitrogen oxide “nox” andor volatile organic compound “voc” reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities 

in california the board for the south coast air quality management district “scaqmd” passed amendments to the regional clean air incentives market “reclaim” that became effective in 2016 requiring a staged reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 in 2017 the state of california passed ab 617 which requires implementation of best available retrofit control technology “barct” on specific facilities including facilities subject to reclaim in response to ab 617 the scaqmd is currently working to identify barct and determine whether to “sunset” the existing reclaim program a “sunset” of the reclaim program and application of barct is expected to result in increased costs to operate and maintain our los angeles refinery 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other things requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances opa90 also requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages and provides for civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we operate tank vessels and facilities from which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

on october 22 2019 the epa and the united states army corps of engineers “army corps” published a final rule to repeal the 2015 “clean water rule definition of waters of the united states” “2015 rule” which amended portions of the code of federal regulations “cfr” to restore the regulatory text that existed prior to the 2015 rule effective december 23 2019 the rule repealing the 2015 clean water rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts on april 21 2020 the epa and the army corps promulgated the navigable waters protection rule “2020 rule” to define “waters of the united states” the 2020 rule has been challenged in court the biden administration has signaled its intent to revisit the definition of “waters of the united states” and replace it with a definition consistent with the 2015 rule a 

table of contents 

broader definition could result in increased cost of compliance or increased capital costs for construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities 

in april 2020 the us district court in montana vacated nationwide permit 12 “nwp 12” which authorizes the placement of fill material in “waters of the united states” for utility line activities as long as certain best management practices are implemented the decision was ultimately appealed to the united states supreme court which partially reversed the district court’s decision temporarily reinstating nwp 12 for all projects except the keystone xl oil pipeline the united states army corps of engineers subsequently reissued its nationwide permit authorizations on january 13 2021 by dividing the nwp that authorizes utility line activities nwp 12 into three separate nwps that address the differences in how different utility line projects are constructed the substances they convey and the different standards and best management practices that help ensure those nwps authorize only those activities that have no more than minimal adverse environmental effects the 2021 authorization may be challenged in court or the biden administration may repeal or replace the 2021 authorization in a subsequent rulemaking repeal or replacement of the rule could impact pipeline maintenance activities 

as part of our emergency response activities we have used aqueous film forming foam “afff” containing per and polyfluoroalkyl substances “pfas” chemicals as a fire suppressant at this time afffs containing pfas are the only proven foams that can prevent and control most flammable petroleumbased liquid fires 

in may 2016 the epa issued lifetime health advisories “has” and health effects support documents for two pfas substances  perfluorooctanoic acid “pfoa” and perfluorooctane sulfonate “pfos” then in february 2019 epa issued a pfas action plan identifying actions the epa is planning to take to study and regulate various pfas chemicals the epa identified that it would evaluate among other actions 1 proposing national drinking water standards for pfoa and pfos 2 develop cleanup recommendations for pfoa and pfos 3 evaluate listing pfoa and pfos as hazardous substances under cercla and 4 conduct toxicity assessments for other pfas chemicals to date epa has not issued any further regulations for pfas under the trump administration however the biden administration has indicated its intent to issue proposed rules to regulate pfas which could include the designation of variants of pfas as cercla hazardous substances andor establish national drinking water standards congress may also take further action to regulate pfas we cannot currently predict the impact of potential statutes or regulations on our operations or remediation costs 

in addition many states are actively proposing and adopting legislation and regulations relating to the use of afff additionally some states are adopting and proposing statespecific drinking water and cleanup standards for various pfas we cannot currently predict the impact of these regulations on our liquidity financial position or results of operations 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of usts containing regulated substances 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain convenience stores and other locations where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the applicable state laws and regulations a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint 

table of contents 

and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

renewable fuels and other fuels requirements 

the us congress passed the energy independence and security act of 2007 “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 in march 2020 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” released the final safer affordable fuelefficient “safe” vehicles rule setting corporate average fuel economy “cafe” and carbon dioxide “co2” standards for model years 20212026 passenger cars and light trucks the final rule increases the stringency of cafe and co2 emission standards by 15 percent each year from model years 2021 through 2026 the rule has been challenged in court and could be revised by the biden administration through notice and comment rulemaking higher cafe standards for cars and light trucks have the potential to reduce demand for our transportation fuels 

in addition the nhtsa and the epa issued rules providing that the energy policy and conservation act “epca” preempts state regulations of tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions withdrew the waiver granted to california for its advanced clean car program and determined that the clean air act permits other states to adopt only those california standards that are designed to control traditional “criteria pollutants” california may establish per its clean air act waiver authority different standards that could apply in multiple states california’s governor issued an executive order requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles in the state be zeroemission by 2035 other states have issued or may issue zero emission vehicle mandates the biden administration could reinstate the california waiver and may take federal action to incentivize or mandate zero emission vehicle production 

pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the eisa the epa has promulgated a renewable fuel standard “rfs” program that requires certain volumes of renewable fuel be blended with our products by november 30 of each year the epa is required to promulgate the annual renewable fuel standards for the following compliance year in a legal challenge to the 20142016 volumes the dc circuit court of appeals vacated the total renewable volume for 2016 and remanded to the epa for reconsideration consistent with the court’s opinion a rule that increases the total renewable volume for any compliance year to make up for the 2016 shortfall could increase our cost of compliance with the rfs program require us to use carryover rins and be detrimental to the rin market 

the epa has finalized the annual renewable fuel standards for the year 2020 for the first time the epa has proposed to reallocate to nonexempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners that were granted a small refinery exemption also the tenth circuit court of appeals held that a small refinery is eligible for an exemption from the rfs only if it is applying for an extension of its original exemption according to the epa’s data seven refineries were granted the small refinery exemption in 2015 the united states supreme court has granted certiorari in the 10th circuit case if the 10th circuit decision is upheld epa’s reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 2020 the reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the rin bank an increase in the price of rins or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend any of which could increase mpc’s rfs cost of compliance further the epa has failed to promulgate timely the annual renewable fuel standards for 2021 

the rfs is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline vehicle regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline “e10” since 2016 the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the e10 blendwall which will require obligated parties to either sell e15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed historical levels or retire carryover rins 

there is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the rins sold on the open market we have developed a rin integrity program to vet the rins that we purchase and we incur costs to audit rin generators nevertheless if any of the rins that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be invalid we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid rins 

table of contents 

in addition to the federal renewable fuel standards certain states have or are considering promulgation of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards for example california began implementing its low carbon fuel standard “lcfs” in january 2011 in september 2015 the carb approved the readoption of the lcfs which became effective on january 1 2016 to address procedural deficiencies in the way the original regulation was adopted the lcfs was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030 we incur costs to comply with the california lcfs and these costs may increase if the cost of lcfs credits increases 

in sum the rfs has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use we may experience a decrease in demand for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced by renewable fuels demand for our refined products also may decrease as a result of low carbon fuel standard programs or electric vehicle mandates 

safety matters 

we are subject to oversight pursuant to the federal occupational safety and health act as amended “osha” as well as comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers we believe that we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with osha requirements including general industry standards recordkeeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 

we are also subject at regulated facilities to the osha’s process safety management “psm” and epa’s risk management program requirements which are intended to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic reactive flammable or explosive chemicals the application of these regulations can result in increased compliance expenditures 

in general we expect industry and regulatory safety standards to become stricter over time resulting in increased compliance expenditures while these expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time we do not expect such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the dot has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design construction operation maintenance inspection and management of our pipeline assets these regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies these regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans 

tribal lands 

various federal agencies including the epa and the department of the interior along with certain native american tribes promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on native american tribal lands where we operate these regulations include such matters as lease provisions drilling and production requirements and standards to protect environmental quality and cultural resources in addition each native american tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal state and local statutes and regulations these laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on native american tribal lands and impact the viability of or prevent or delay our ability to conduct our operations on such lands 

trademarks patents and licenses 

our marathon and arco trademarks are material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations and our speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail operations we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole in general we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of knowhow rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

business and operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in demand for the petroleum products that we manufacture sell transport and store which has had and may continue to have a material and adverse effect on our business and on general economic financial and business conditions 

the covid19 pandemic continues to negatively impact worldwide economic and commercial activity travel restrictions business and school closures increased remote work stayathome orders and other actions taken by individuals governments and the private sector to stem the spread of the virus have significantly reduced global economic activity significantly reduced demand for the petroleum products that we manufacture sell transport and store and contributed to increased market and oil price volatility our refinery utilization and operating margins and other aspects of our business have been adversely impacted by these developments 

during 2020 there were significant variations in the market prices of products held in our inventories in each quarter of 2020 these variations required us to record either inventory valuation charges or benefits to reflect the valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market 

depending on future movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect on our financial performance in addition a sustained period of low crude oil prices may also result in significant financial constraints on certain producers from which we acquire our crude oil which could result in long term crude oil supply constraints for our business such conditions could also result in an increased risk that our customers and other counterparties may be unable to fully fulfill their obligations in a timely manner or at all 

resurgences in covid19 infections could result in the imposition of new stayathome orders or other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus which could further weaken demand for the petroleum products we manufacture sell transport and store and could contribute to increased market and oil price volatility 

a prolonged period of economic slowdown or recession or a protracted period of depressed prices for crude oil or refined petroleum products could continue to have significant and adverse consequences for our financial condition and the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other counterparties and 

table of contents 

could diminish our liquidity trigger additional impairments and negatively affect our ability to obtain adequate crude oil volumes and to market certain of our products at favorable prices or at all 

the ultimate extent to which covid19 will continue to negatively affect us and our customers suppliers and other counterparties will depend largely on the length and severity of the pandemic actions taken by individuals governments and the private sector to stem the spread of the virus general economic conditions and the availability and widespread distribution and use of safe and effective vaccines all of which cannot be predicted with certainty 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins which are dependent on factors beyond our control 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products historically refining and marketing margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market factors that are beyond our control including 

• worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and refined products 

• transportation infrastructure availability local market conditions and operation levels of other refineries in our markets 

• natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries 

• political instability threatened or actual terrorist incidents armed conflict or other global political conditions 

• local weather conditions 

• seasonality of demand in our marketing areas due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months 

• natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes 

• domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes and 

• local regional national and worldwide economic conditions 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks can have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products can have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing margins have in the past and may in the future lead us to reduce the amount of refined products we produce which may reduce our revenues income from operations and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures impair the carrying value of our assets such as property plant and equipment inventory or goodwill and require us to reevaluate practices regarding our repurchase activity and dividends 

legal technological political and scientific developments regarding emissions and fuel efficiency may decrease demand for transportation fuels 

developments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing vehicle efficiency may decrease the demand or increase the cost for our transportation fuels in march 2020 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and the us department of transportation’s national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” released the final safer affordable fuelefficient “safe” vehicles rule setting corporate average fuel economy “cafe” and carbon dioxide “co2” standards for model years 2021 through 2026 passenger cars and light trucks the final rule increases the stringency of cafe and co2 emission standards by 15 percent each year from model years 2021 through 2026 the rule has been challenged in court and could be revised by the biden administration through notice and comment rulemaking in addition california’s governor issued an executive order requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles in the state be zeroemission by 2035 other states have or may issue zeroemission

vehicle mandates future developments involving climate change and environmental laws and regulations may require heightened fuel efficiency standards 

government efforts to steer the public toward nonpetroleumbased fuel dependent modes of transportation may foster a negative perception toward transportation fuels or increase costs for our products new technologies that increase fuel efficiency or offer alternative vehicle power sources and the proliferation of alternativefuel vehicles ie vehicles that do not use petroleumbased transportation fuels or that are powered by hybrid engines may result in decreased demand for petroleumbased transportation fuel these developments could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses which could materially and adversely affect our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions such as scheduled and unscheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases power outages severe weather labor disputes acts of terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters the inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases product quality or other incidents may result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us we have experienced certain of these incidents in the past for assets located near populated areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater 

in addition we operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive waters where tanker pipeline rail car and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups certain of our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by tanker or barge mplx operates a fleet of boats and barges to transport light products heavy oils crude oil renewable fuels chemicals and feedstocks to and from refineries and terminals owned by mpc transportation and storage of crude oil other feedstocks and refined products over and adjacent to water involves inherent risk and subjects us to the provisions of the opa90 and state laws in us coastal and great lakes states and states bordering inland waterways on which we operate as well as international laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate if we are unable to promptly and adequately contain any accident or discharge involving tankers pipelines rail cars or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil other feedstocks or refined products we may be subject to substantial liability in addition the service providers contracted to aid us in a discharge response may be unavailable due to weather conditions governmental regulations or other local or global events 

damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

we rely on the performance of our information technology systems and the interruption or failure of any information technology system including an interruption or failure due to a cybersecurity breach could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and those of our thirdparty business partners whether cloudbased or hosted on proprietary servers including our network infrastructure and cloud applications for the safe and effective operation of our business we rely on such systems to process transmit and store electronic information including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee customer investor and payroll data and to manage or support a variety of business processes including our supply chain pipeline operations gathering and processing operations retail sales credit card payments and authorizations at our retail outlets financial transactions banking and numerous other processes and transactions our systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters malware power failures cyberattacks and other events we also face various other cybersecurity threats from criminal hackers and employee malfeasance including threats to gain unauthorized access to our computer network and systems or render data or systems unusable 

table of contents 

our cybersecurity protections infrastructure protection technologies disaster recovery plans and employee training may not be sufficient to defend us against all unauthorized attempts to access our information we have been and may in the future be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to our computer network and systems to date the impacts of prior events have not had a material adverse effect on us 

any cybersecurity incident involving our information technology systems or those of our thirdparty business partners could result in theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential financial and other data intellectual property customer awards or loyalty points give rise to remediation or other expenses expose us to liability under federal and state laws reduce our customers’ willingness to do business with us disrupt the services we provide to customers and subject us to litigation and legal liability under federal and state laws any of such results could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

competition in our industry is intense and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business 

we compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies including certain multinational oil companies competitors with integrated operations with exploration and production resources and broader access to resources may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions and to bear the risks inherent in the refining industry for example competitors that engage in exploration and production of crude oil may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

we have agreed to sell speedway to 7eleven nevertheless pending closing of the speedway sale which remains subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals we still face strong competition in the market for the retail sale of transportation fuels and merchandise our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling transportation fuels and merchandise at very competitive prices nontraditional transportation fuel retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales which could in turn pressure us to offer similar discounts additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either transportation fuels or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions 

in particular pipelines or railroads provide a nearly exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries a prolonged interruption material reduction or cessation of service of such a pipeline or railway whether due to private party or governmental action or other reason or any other prolonged disruption of the ability of the trucks pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant decrease in oil and natural gas production in mplx’s areas of operation may adversely affect mplx’s business financial condition results of operations and cash available for distribution to its unitholders including mpc 

a significant portion of mplx’s operations is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production the production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers will naturally decline over time which means that mplx’s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of mplx’s facilities mplx must continually obtain new oil natural gas ngl and refined product supplies which depend in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its system capacity as needed 

table of contents 

we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of mplx’s operations the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline in addition we have no control over producers or their production decisions which are affected by demand prevailing and projected energy prices drilling costs operational challenges access to downstream markets the level of reserves geological considerations governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital reductions in exploration or production activity in mplx’s areas of operations could lead to reduced throughput on its pipelines and utilization rates of its facilities 

decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves the prices for oil natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond our control including global and local demand production levels changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications imports and exports seasonality and weather conditions economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations sustained periods of low prices could result in producers deciding to limit their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil natural gas and ngls to mplx’s facilities and adversely affect their revenues and cash available for distribution to us 

this impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of mplx’s commoditybased contracts which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and ngl prices than its feebased contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a btu equivalent basis than ngl products in addition the purchase and resale of natural gas and ngls in the ordinary course exposes our midstream operations to volatility in natural gas or ngl prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of production processes also the significant volatility in natural gas ngl and oil prices could adversely impact mplx’s unit price thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital such impacts could adversely impact mplx’s ability to execute its long‑term organic growth projects satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels and may also result in noncash impairments of longlived assets or goodwill or otherthantemporary noncash impairments of our equity method investments 

severe weather events and other climate conditions may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations 

our facilities are subject to potential acute physical risks such as floods hurricaneforce winds wildfires and snowstorms and potential chronic physical risks such as sealevel rise or water shortages if any such events were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to protect our assets and operations from such physical risks and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks to the extent such severe weather events or other climate conditions increase in frequency and severity we may be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from our operations outside the united states and generally to worldwide political and economic developments 

we operate and sell some of our products outside the united states particularly in mexico south america and asia our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets including economic instability restrictions on the transfer of funds duties and tariffs transportation delays difficulty in enforcing contractual provisions import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest security issues involving key personnel and changing regulatory and political environments global outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the current covid19 pandemic could affect demand for refined products and economic conditions generally in addition if trade relationships deteriorate with these countries if existing trade agreements are modified or terminated if new economic sanctions relevant to such jurisdictions are passed or if taxes border adjustments or tariffs make trading with these countries more costly it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are required to comply with us and international laws and regulations including those involving antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering for example the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage our compliance policies and programs mandate 

table of contents 

compliance with all applicable anticorruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

more broadly political and economic factors in global markets could impact crude oil and other feedstock supplies and could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products ngls and natural gas additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability for example the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products ngls natural gas or the conduct of business in or with certain foreign countries in addition foreign countries could restrict imports investments or commercial transactions 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our reliance on our joint venture partners and their financial condition and our joint venture partners may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours 

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners our joint venture partners may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations failure by us or an entity in which we have an interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

refining gathering and processing pipeline and terminal infrastructure and other energy assets may be future targets of terrorist organizations any terrorist attack on our facilities those of our customers and in some cases those of other energy assets could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

financial risks 

we have significant debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile or downgrade of our credit ratings a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

at december 31 2020 our total debt obligations for borrowed money and finance lease obligations were 3217 billion including 2054 billion of obligations of mplx and its subsidiaries and 130 million of obligations of speedway we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to changing economic regulatory and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry 

• limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and 

• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases dividends and other purposes 

table of contents 

a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant the planned speedway sale could be a factor causing or contributing to a future determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower our credit rating any changes in our credit capacity or credit profile could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to 750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables outstanding in periods of lower prices we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility 

our working capital cash flows and liquidity can be significantly affected by decreases in commodity prices 

payment terms for our crude oil purchases are generally longer than the terms we extend to our customers for refined product sales as a result the payables for our crude oil purchases are proportionally larger than the receivables for our refined product sales due to this net payables position a decrease in commodity prices generally results in a use of working capital and given the significant volume of crude oil that we purchase the impact can materially affect our working capital cash flows and liquidity 

the expected phase out of libor could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and could cause our interest expense to increase 

a portion of our borrowing capacity and outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor the ice benchmark administration limited “ice” announced that it will cease calculating and publishing all usd libor tenors on june 30 2023 and cease calculating and publishing certain usd libor tenors on december 31 2021 further uk and us regulatory authorities have recently issued statements encouraging banks to cease entering into new usd libor based loans as soon as possible and by no later than december 31 2021 and to continue to transition away from usd libor based loans in preparation of ice ceasing to calculate and public libor based rates on june 30 2023 these developments may cause fluctuations in libor rates and pricing of usd libor based loans that are not transitioned to a new benchmark rate 

the agreements that govern our variable rate indebtedness contain customary transition and fallback provisions in contemplation of the cessation of libor nevertheless at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor other benchmarks or floating rate indebtedness uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks furthermore the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the market value of the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our floating rate indebtedness to be materially different than expected and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance such floating rate indebtedness or raise future indebtedness on a cost effective basis 

we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases cybersecurity breaches or other incidents involving our 

table of contents 

assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become further impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

we accounted for the andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded to our balance sheet at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill 

as of december 31 2020 our balance sheet reflected 83 billion and 24 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets respectively in 2020 we recorded approximately 74 billion and 177 million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment expense respectively to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes further impaired we may be required to incur additional material noncash charges relating to such impairment our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment 

large capital projects can take years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns 

we have several large capital projects underway including the activities associated with the conversion of the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility delays in completing capital projects or making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

• denials of delays in receiving or revocations of requisite regulatory approvals or permits 

• unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor 

• disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials 

• adverse weather conditions natural disasters or other events such as equipment malfunctions explosions fires or spills affecting our facilities or those of vendors or suppliers 

• shortages of sufficiently skilled labor or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages 

• marketrelated increases in a project’s debt or equity financing costs 

• nonperformance by or disputes with vendors suppliers contractors or subcontractors and 

• delays due to citizen state or local political or activist pressure 

any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs to meet the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws or regulations future environmental laws and regulations may impact our current business plans and reduce demand for our products 

our business is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our business laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following 

• the emission or discharge of materials into the environment 

• solid and hazardous waste management 

• the regulatory classification of materials currently or formerly used in our business 

• pollution prevention 

• greenhouse gas emissions 

• climate change 

table of contents 

• characteristics and composition of transportation fuels including the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into transportation fuels 

• public and employee safety and health 

• permitting 

• inherently safer technology and 

• facility security 

the specific impact of laws and regulations and their enforcement on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources production processes and subsequent judicial interpretation of such laws and regulations we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations we may also face liability for personal injury property damage natural resource damage or cleanup costs due to alleged contamination andor exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials such as various perfluorinated compounds including perfluorooctanoate perfluorooctane sulfonate perfluorohexane sulfonate or other perand polyfluoroalkyl substances benzene mtbe and petroleum hydrocarbons at or from our facilities such expenditures could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas production activities could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

while we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations we do provide gathering processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result of such operations our refineries are also supplied in part with crude oil produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs a range of federal state and local laws and regulations currently govern or in some cases prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions stricter laws regulations and permitting processes may be enacted in the future for example president biden has suspended new oil and gas permitting on public lands and properties and has proposed modifying royalties to account for climate costs if these or other federal state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing or other oil and gas production activities are enacted or expanded such efforts could impede oil and gas production increase producers’ cost of compliance and result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather process and fractionate 

climate change and greenhouse gas emission regulation could affect our operations energy consumption patterns and regulatory obligations any of which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

currently multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas including carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides and other emissions are in various phases of consideration promulgation or implementation these include actions to develop international federal regional or statewide programs which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for refined products requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments 

for example in 2017 the california state legislature adopted ab 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 percent reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in sb 32 compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a marketbased credit system additionally the carb is now exploring the potential for additional greenhouse gas reductions by 2045 via a yet undefined carbon neutrality standard other states are proposing or have already promulgated low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector if we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy increasing concerns about climate change and carbon 

table of contents 

intensity have also resulted in societal concerns and a number of international and national measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions additional stricter measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition 

international climate changerelated efforts such as the 2015 united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations though the united states had withdrawn from the paris agreement president biden issued an executive order recommitting the united states to the paris agreement on january 20 2021 president biden also issued an executive order on climate change in which he announced putting the us on a path to achieve netzero carbon emissions economywide by 2050 the executive order also calls for the federal government to pause oil and gas leasing on federal lands reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible and requires federal permitting decisions to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in a second executive order president biden reestablished a working group to develop the social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane the social cost of carbon and social cost of methane can be used to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations a higher social cost of carbon could support more stringent greenhouse gas emission regulation 

the scope and magnitude of the changes to us climate change strategy under the biden administration and future administrations however remain subject to the passage of legislation and interpretation and action of federal and state regulatory bodies therefore the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time 

energy assets and companies are subject to increasing environmental and climaterelated litigation 

governmental and other entities in various us states have filed lawsuits against coal gas oil and petroleum companies including us the lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions additionally private plaintiffs and government parties have undertaken efforts to shut down energy assets by challenging operating permits the validity of easements or the compliance with easement conditions for example the dakota access pipeline in which mplx has a minority interest has been subject to litigation in which plaintiffs have challenged the validity of an easement necessary for the operation of the pipeline and demanded a permanent shutdown of the pipeline there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these types of proceedings as well as their potential effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies 

we operate and develop our business with the expectation that regulations and societal sentiment will continue to enable the development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels however policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation storage and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups 

the approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry and concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions downstream of pipeline operations in addition government disruptions may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business our expansion or construction projects may not be completed on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost we also may be required to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with the design and installation of our facilities due to their location and the surrounding terrain we may be required to install additional facilities incur additional capital and operating expenditures or experience interruptions in or impairments of our operations to the extent that the facilities are not designed or installed correctly 

moreover our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project for instance if we build a new pipeline the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project if at all delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely

affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows 

regulatory and other requirements concerning the transportation of crude oil and other commodities by rail may cause increases in transportation costs or limit the amount of crude oil that we can transport by rail 

we rely on a variety of systems to transport crude oil including rail rail transportation is regulated by federal state and local authorities new regulations or changes in existing regulations could result in increased compliance expenditures for example in 2015 the us department of transportation issued new standards and regulations applicable to crudebyrail transportation enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for highhazard flammable trains these or other regulations that require the reduction of volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail change the design or standards for rail cars used to transport the crude oil we purchase change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil or require any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering north american crude oil by rail could increase the time required to move crude oil from production areas to our refineries increase the cost of rail transportation and decrease the efficiency of shipments of crude oil by rail within our operations any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations including those of mplx and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials have in the past and may in the future pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 3771 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements of these employees approximately 192 employees at our st paul park refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expired on december 31 2020 approximately 231 employees at our el paso refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in april 2021 approximately 2390 employees at our anacortes canton catlettsburg galveston bay los angeles mandan martinez and salt lake city refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire on february 1 2022 the remaining 958 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024 these agreements may be renewed at an increased cost to us in addition we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements for example approximately 192 workers at our st paul park refinery have been on strike since january 21 2021 any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition california requires refinery owners to pay prevailing wages to contract craft workers and restricts refiners’ ability to hire qualified employees to a limited pool of applicants legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages higher labor costs and an increased risk that contract workers become joint employees which could trigger bargaining issues and wage and benefit consequences especially during critical maintenance and construction periods

table of contents 

the forum selection provision may restrict a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim against us or directors or officers of mpc in a forum that it finds favorable which may discourage stockholders from bringing such claims at all alternatively if a court were to find the forum selection provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in another forum which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations however the forum selection provision does not apply to any claims actions or proceedings arising under the securities act or the exchange act 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 

• providing that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board 

• providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms 

• providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies 

• limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders 

• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders

• providing that our directors may only be removed for cause 

• authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management thereby protecting the continuity of our management or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us and 

• authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock

dakota access pipeline 

in connection with mplx’s 919 percent indirect interest in a joint venture “dakota access” that owns and operates the dakota access pipeline and energy transfer crude oil pipeline projects collectively the “bakken pipeline system” or “dapl” mplx has entered into a contingent equity contribution agreement whereby mplx lp along with the other joint venture owners in the bakken pipeline system has agreed to make equity contributions to the joint venture upon certain events occurring to allow the entities that own and operate the bakken pipeline system to satisfy their senior note payment obligations the senior notes were issued to repay amounts owed by the pipeline companies to fund the cost of construction of the bakken pipeline system 

table of contents 

in march 2020 the us district court for the district of columbia the “ddc” ordered the us army corps of engineers “army corps” which granted permits and an easement for the bakken pipeline system to conduct a full environmental impact statement “eis” and further requested briefing on whether an easement necessary for the operation of the bakken pipeline system should be vacated while the eis is being prepared 

on july 6 2020 the ddc ordered vacatur of the easement to cross lake oahe during the pendency of an eis and further ordered a shut down of the pipeline by august 5 2020 the ddc denied a motion to stay that order dakota access and the army corps appealed the ddc’s order to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “court of appeals” on july 14 2020 the court of appeals issued an administrative stay while the court considered dakota access and the army corps’ emergency motion for stay pending appeal on august 5 2020 the court of appeals stayed the ddc’s injunction that required the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil by august 5 2020 the court of appeals denied a stay of the ddc’s march order which required the eis and further denied a stay of the ddc’s july order which vacated the easement on january 26 2021 the court of appeals upheld the ddc’s order vacating the easement while the army corps prepares the eis the court of appeals reversed the ddc’s order to the extent it directed that the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil in the ddc briefing has been completed for a renewed request for an injunction the pipeline remains operational 

if the pipeline is temporarily shut down pending completion of the eis mplx would have to contribute its 919 percent pro rata share of funds required to pay interest accruing on the notes and any portion of the principal that matures while the pipeline is shutdown it is also expected that mplx would contribute its 919 percent pro rata share of any costs to remediate any deficiencies to reinstate the permit andor return the pipeline into operation if the vacatur of the easement permit results in a permanent shutdown of the pipeline mplx would have to contribute its 919 percent pro rata share of the cost to redeem the bonds including the one percent redemption premium required pursuant to the indenture governing the notes and any accrued and unpaid interest as of december 31 2020 our maximum potential undiscounted payments under the contingent equity contribution agreement were approximately 230 million and we had an investment of 465 million in maren bakken company llc which includes our 919 percent direct interest in dakota access 

tesoro high plains pipeline 

in early july 2020 mplx received a notification of trespass determination from the bureau of indian affairs “bia” relating to a portion of the tesoro high plains pipeline that crosses the fort berthold reservation in north dakota the notification covered the rights of way for 23 tracts of land and demanded the immediate cessation of pipeline operations the notification also assessed trespass damages of approximately 187 million mplx appealed this determination which triggered an automatic stay of the requested pipeline shutdown and payment on october 29 the assistant secretary  indian affairs issued an order vacating the bia’s trespass order and requiring the regional director for the bia great plains region to issue a new decision on or before december 15 covering all 34 tracts at issue on december 15 the regional director of the bia issued a new trespass notice to thpp consistent with the assistant secretary of indian affairs order vacating the prior trespass order the new order found that thpp was in trespass and assessed trespass damages of approximately 4mm including interest the order also required thpp to immediately cease and desist use of the portion of the pipeline that crosses the property at issue the new order was appealed and was upheld by the assistant secretary  indian affairs thpp has complied with the regional director’s december 15 2020 notice on february 12 2021 landowners filed suit in the us district court for the district of north dakota requesting among other things that decisions by the assistant secretary  indian affairs and the interior board of indian appeals be vacated as to the award of damages to plaintiffs

martinez refinery 

we are currently negotiating the settlement of 141 novs received from the bay area air quality management district “baaqmd” the novs were issued from 2011 to 2019 and allege violations of air quality regulations and the idled martinez refinery’s air permit while we are negotiating a settlement of the allegations with the baaqmd through two separate enforcement actions we cannot currently estimate the timing of the resolution of these matters 

on july 18 2016 the us department of justice “doj” lodged a complaint on behalf of the epa and a consent decree in the us court for the western district of texas among other things the consent decree required that the martinez refinery meet certain annual emission limits for nox by july 1 2018 in february 2018 trmc informed the epa that it would need additional time to satisfy requirements of the consent decree in the fourth quarter of 2019 trmc and the united states entered into an agreement to amend the consent decree to resolve these issues in light of the actions to strategically reposition the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility we are renegotiating the consent decree modification subject to final approval by the court we expect that the renegotiated consent decree modification will no longer require the installation of a selective catalytic reduction system to control nox emissions from the nowidled fluid catalytic cracking unit but will result in an increased civil penalty 

gathering and processing 

in november 2020 we received an offer from the epa to settle multiple alleged violations of the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants by the chapita coyote wash island river bend and wonsits valley compressor stations in utah the proposed settlement consists of an injunctive relief package mitigation project and proposed penalty in excess of 300000 we continue to negotiate a settlement of the allegations and cannot currently estimate the timing of the resolution of this matter

executive summary 

business update 

the outbreak of covid19 and its development into a pandemic in march 2020 have resulted in significant economic disruption globally actions taken by various governmental authorities individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of covid19 through social distancing have restricted travel many business operations public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and inperson interaction across the globe 

this has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity including a dramatic reduction in airline flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use as a result there has been a decline in the demand for the refined petroleum products that we manufacture and sell which coupled with a decline in the price of crude oil for most of 2020 resulted in a significant decrease in the price and volume of our production and sales of refined petroleum products 

during 2020 there were significant variations in the market prices of products held in our inventories in each quarter of 2020 these variations required us to record either inventory valuation charges or benefits to reflect the valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market 

we have been and continue to actively respond to the impacts that these matters are having on our business our response has focused on establishing three strategic shortterm priorities 

strengthen competitive position of assets 

we are committed to positioning our assets so that we are a leader in operational financial and sustainability performance and are evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio our goal is that each individual asset generates freecashflow back to the business and contributes to shareholder returns with our investments we are focused on high returning projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness of our portfolio including our investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves 

improve commercial performance 

we are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection new approaches in the commercial space to be more dynamic amidst changing market conditions and achieving technology improvements to advance our commercial performance 

lower cost structure 

we are committed to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs improving efficiency and driving operational improvements in response to the pandemic in march of 2020 we committed to immediately reducing our capital spending and operating expenses we accomplished our goal of significantly reducing our capital spending levels by over 14 billion from our initial 2020 plans we also reduced our 2020 forecasted operating expenses by more than our target of 950 million 

in connection with these three strategic shortterm priorities in the third quarter of 2020 we announced strategic actions to lay a foundation for longterm success including plans to optimize our assets and structurally lower costs in 2021 and beyond these actions included indefinitely idling the gallup refinery initiating actions to strategically reposition the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and the approval of an involuntary workforce reduction plan in connection with these strategic actions we recorded restructuring expenses of 367 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

table of contents 

in addition to these measures to address our operations throughout the year we took action to address our liquidity as outlined below 

• share repurchases were temporarily suspended the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions 

• on april 27 2020 we entered into an additional 10 billion 364day revolving credit facility which expires in 2021 to provide incremental liquidity and financial flexibility during the commodity price and demand downturn in february 2021 we elected to terminate this credit agreement as we no longer believe the facility is necessary as an additional source for liquidity and we do not intend to replace it 

• on april 27 2020 we closed on the issuance of 25 billion of senior notes proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay down certain amounts outstanding on the fiveyear revolving credit facility 

• during june 2020 we repaid the remaining amounts outstanding on the fiveyear revolving credit facility 

• on september 23 2020 we entered into a 364day revolving credit agreement which provides for a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in september 2021 and which replaced a similar 364day revolving credit agreement that expired on september 28 2020 

• at december 31 2020 we had 673 billion available on our variable credit facilities net of commercial paper borrowings of 102 billion 

many uncertainties remain with respect to covid19 including its resulting economic effects and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from covid19 and how quickly national economies can recover once the pandemic ultimately subsides however the adverse impact of the economic effects on mpc has been and will likely continue to be significant we believe we have proactively addressed many of the known impacts of covid19 to the extent possible and will strive to continue to do so but there can be no guarantee the measures will be fully effective 

other strategic updates 

the dickinson north dakota renewable fuels facility began ramping operations at the end of 2020 and is ontrack to reach full production by the end of the first quarter of 2021 at full capacity the facility is expected to produce 184 million gallons per year of renewable diesel from corn and soybean oil mpc intends to sell the renewable diesel into the california market to comply with the california low carbon fuel standard 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we also progressed activities associated with the conversion of the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility including applying for permits advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers and beginning detailed engineering activities as envisioned the martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022 with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023 on february 24 2021 mpc’s board of directors approved these plans 

on november 2 2020 mplx announced the authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 1 billion of its outstanding common units held by the public mplx may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market repurchases negotiated block transactions tender offers accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and repurchases may be initiated suspended or discontinued at any time the repurchase authorization has no expiration date 

during the year ended december 31 2020 1473843 mplx common units were repurchased at an average cost per unit of 2229 total cash paid for units repurchased during the year was 33 million and 967 million of repurchase authorization remained outstanding on the program as of december 31 2020

during 2020 actions taken by various governmental authorities individuals and companies to prevent the spread of covid19 through social distancing restricted travel many business operations public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and inperson interaction in the areas where we operate which impacted demand for our products net income attributable to mpc decreased 1246 billion or 1910 per diluted share in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a loss in our refining  marketing segment goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges of 843 billion and impairments of equity method investments of 132 billion during the period primarily driven by the effects of covid19 and the decline in commodity prices and restructuring expenses of 367 million related to the idling of the martinez and gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction 

the loss from operations in our refining  marketing segment is primarily due to decreases in refined product sales volumes prices and margins during 2020 and includes a charge of 561 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 to reflect a lifo liquidation for our crude oil and refined product inventories the costs of inventories in the historical lifo layers which were liquidated were higher than current costs which resulted in increased cost of revenues and decreased income from operations these results were partially offset by increased income from discontinued operations which relates to speedway in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to higher fuel margins partially offset by lower fuel volumes in addition as of august 2 2020 mpc ceased recording depreciation and amortization for speedway see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5 for additional information on discontinued operations

mplx 

we received limited partner distributions of 179 billion and 182 billion from mplx and andeavor logistics lp “andx” during 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we owned approximately 647 million mplx common units at december 31 2020 with a market value of 1402 billion based on the december 31 2020 closing unit price of 2165 on january 28 2021 mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of 06875 per common unit which was paid february 12 2021 as a result mplx made distributions totaling 714 million to its common unitholders mpc’s portion of this distribution was approximately 445 million 

on july 31 2020 western refining southwest inc now known as western refining southwest llc “wrsw” a wholly owned subsidiary of mpc entered into a redemption agreement the “redemption agreement” with mplx pursuant to which mplx transferred to wrsw all of the outstanding membership interests in western refining wholesale llc “wrw” in exchange for the redemption of mplx common units held by wrsw the transaction effected the transfer to mpc of the western wholesale distribution business that mplx acquired as a result of its acquisition of andx beginning in the third quarter of 2020 the results of these operations are presented in mpc’s refining  marketing segment 

at the closing per the terms of redemption agreement mplx redeemed 18582088 mplx common units held by wrsw the number of redeemed units was calculated by dividing wrw’s aggregate valuation of 340 million by the simple average of the volume weighted average new york stock exchange prices of an mplx common unit for the ten trading days ending at market close on july 27 2020 the transaction resulted in a minor decrease in mpc’s ownership interest in mplx

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining  marketing margin refining operating costs refining planned turnarounds distribution costs depreciation expenses and refinery throughputs our total refining capacity was 2874 mbpcd 3067 mbpcd and 3021 mbpcd as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

our refining  marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison 

table of contents 

with other industry participants we calculate gulf coast midcontinent and west coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products the following will be used for these crackspread calculations 

• the gulf coast crack spread uses three barrels of lls crude producing two barrels of usgc cbob gasoline and one barrel of usgc ulsd 

• the midcontinent crack spread uses three barrels of wti crude producing two barrels of chicago cbob gasoline and one barrel of chicago ulsd and 

• the west coast crack spread uses three barrels of ans crude producing two barrels of la carbob and one barrel of la carb diesel 

our refineries process a variety of sweet and sour grades of crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to the crude oils referenced in our gulf coast midcontinent and west coast crack spreads the amount of these discounts which we refer to as the sweet differential and the sour differential can vary significantly causing our refining  marketing margin to differ from blended crack spreads in general larger sweet and sour differentials will enhance our refining  marketing margin 

future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors as well as us energy policy 

the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions 



a crack spread based on 40 percent lls 40 percent wti and 20 percent ans with gulf coast midcontinent and west coast product pricing respectively and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged 

b sour crude oil basket consists of the following crudes ans argus sour crude index maya and western canadian select we expect approximately 51 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2021 will be sour crude 

c sweet crude oil basket consists of the following crudes bakken brent lls wticushing and wtimidland we expect approximately 49 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2021 will be sweet crude 

d this is consumption based exposure for our refining  marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our midstream segment 

in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sour differential and the sweet differential our refining  marketing margin is impacted by factors such as 

• the selling prices realized for refined products 

• the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed 

• our refinery yields 

• the cost of products purchased for resale 

• the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk 

• the potential impact of lcm adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices and 

• the potential impact of lifo liquidation charges due to drawdowns from historic inventory levels 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market costs of crude oil refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values at december 31 2020 market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

table of contents 

refining  marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refining operating costs and refining planned turnaround costs in addition to committed distribution costs changes in operating costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs refining planned turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery distribution costs primarily include longterm agreements with mplx as discussed below which are based on committed volumes and will negatively impact income from operations in periods when throughput or sales are lower or refineries are idled 

the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years and only reflects the activity for the acquired refineries after october 1 2018 



we have various longterm feebased commercial agreements with mplx under these agreements mplx which is reported in our midstream segment provides transportation storage distribution and marketing services to our refining  marketing segment certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil refined products and other products certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets 

midstream 

our midstream segment transports stores distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for our refining  marketing segment the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines the profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges the profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals the profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products the profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our refining  marketing segment and our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our refining  marketing segment 

as discussed above in the refining  marketing section mplx which is reported in our midstream segment has various longterm feebased commercial agreements related to services provided to our refining  marketing segment under these agreements mplx has received various commitments of minimum throughput storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines terminals and marine operations key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport store distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

our midstream segment also gathers and processes natural gas and ngls ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants purchasing

and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers such prices also affect profitability 

results of operations 

the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 these amounts include the results of andeavor from the october 1 2018 acquisition date forward this discussion should be read in conjunction with item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 

consolidated results of operations

b 2020 includes 132 billion of impairment expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7 for further information 

table of contents 

2020 compared to 2019 

net income loss attributable to mpc decreased 1246 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to impairment expenses for goodwill and longlived assets of 843 billion impairments of equity method investments of 132 billion decreased refined product sales volumes prices and margin a charge of 561 million to reflect a lifo liquidation in our crude oil and refined product inventories and restructuring expenses of 367 million these changes were partially offset by reduced operating costs and increased income from discontinued operations which represents speedway see segment results for additional information 

total revenues and other income decreased 4283 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• decreased sales and other operating revenues of 4137 billion primarily due to decreased refining  marketing segment refined product sales volumes which decreased 513 mbpd or 14 percent and lower average refined product sales prices which decreased 055 per gallon or 31 percent largely due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the covid19 pandemic 

• decreased income from equity method investments of 125 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of 132 billion primarily driven by the effects of covid19 and the decline in commodity prices and 

• decreased net gain on disposal of assets of 208 million mainly due to the absence of 259 million of noncash gains related to obtaining equity investments in capline pipeline company llc “capline llc” and the andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019 this decrease was offset by net gains on disposal of assets in 2020 largely due to the sale of three asphalt terminals and other refining  marketing assets 

total costs and expenses decreased 2612 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• decreased cost of revenues of 3350 billion primarily due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the covid19 pandemic partially offset by increased cost of revenues of 561 million to reflect lifo liquidations for our crude oil and refined product inventories the costs of inventories in the historical lifo layers liquidated were higher than current costs which resulted in the lifo liquidation charge 

• impairment expense of 843 billion recorded in 2020 for goodwill and longlived assets of 739 billion and 103 billion respectively primarily driven by the effects of covid19 and the decline in commodity prices it also includes impairment of longlived assets primarily related to the repositioning of the martinez refinery compared to impairment expense of 120 billion recorded in 2019 primarily related to mplx goodwill associated with the andx gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the andeavor acquisition 

• decreased selling general and administrative expenses of 482 million mainly due to decreases in salaries and employeerelated expenses transactionrelated expenses credit card processing fees for brand customers and contract services expenses 

• restructuring expense of 367 million related to the idling of the martinez and gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction see see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 4 for additional information and 

• increased other taxes of 107 million primarily due to increased property and environmental taxes of approximately 78 million and 69 million respectively property taxes increased in the current period mainly due to the absence of property tax refunds and tax exemptions received in 2019 and environmental taxes increased largely due to the reinstatement of the oil spill tax in 2020 which was not in effect for all of 2019 these increases were offset by a state tax refund and reduced payroll tax expenses 

net interest and other financial costs increased 136 million largely due to increased mpc borrowings and foreign currency exchange losses and decreased interest income we capitalized interest of 129 million in 2020 and 158 million in 2019 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22 for further details 

provision for income taxes decreased 321 billion primarily due to decreased income before taxes of 1685 billion the effective tax rate of 18 percent in 2020 is lower than the us statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to a significant amount of our pretax loss consisting of nontax deductible goodwill impairment charges partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the expected net operating 

table of contents 

loss carryback provided under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act additionally our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in mplx but this benefit was lower for the year ended december 31 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by mplx the effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the us statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 15 for further details 

noncontrolling interests decreased 769 million mainly due to mplx’s net loss primarily resulting from impairment expense recognized during 2020 

2019 compared to 2018 

net income attributable to mpc decreased 143 million primarily due to impairment expense of 120 billion and an increase in net interest and other financial costs partially offset by a decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and increased income from discontinued operations in 2019 see segment results for additional information 

total revenues and other income increased 2528 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to 

• increased sales and other operating revenues of 2506 billion mainly due to an increase in our refining  marketing segment refined product sales volumes which increased 1032 mbpd largely due to the andeavor acquisition on october 1 2018 partially offset by lower average refined product sales prices which decreased 009 per gallon and 

• increased net gain on disposal of assets of 272 million mainly due to 259 million of noncash gains related to obtaining equity investments in capline llc and the andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019 

total costs and expenses increased 2550 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to 

• increased cost of revenues of 2218 billion primarily due to the inclusion of costs related to the andeavor operations following the acquisition 

• increased impairment expense of 120 billion primarily related to mplx goodwill associated with the andx gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the andeavor acquisition 

• increased depreciation and amortization of 106 billion primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the andeavor acquisition 

• increased selling general and administrative expenses of 916 million mainly due to the inclusion of costs related to andeavor operations following the acquisition and reflecting mpc’s classification of those costs and expenses and 

• increased other taxes of 155 million primarily due to the inclusion of other taxes related to the acquired andeavor operations 

net interest and other financial costs increased 236 million mainly due to debt assumed in the acquisition of andeavor and increased mplx borrowings partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement losses of 44 million we capitalized interest of 158 million in 2019 and 80 million in 2018 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22 for further details 

provision for income taxes on continuing operations increased 20 million primarily due to nondeductible goodwill impairments partially offset by decreased income from continuing operations 464 million the effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the us statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests the effective tax rate of 21 percent in 2018 is consistent with the us statutory rate of 21 percent as permanent benefit differences related to income attributable to noncontrolling interest were offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 15 for further details 

noncontrolling interests decreased 214 million mainly due lower mplx net income primarily as a result of the 12 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2019

2020 compared to 2019 

income from discontinued operations net of tax increased 399 million primarily due to higher fuel margins partially offset by lower fuel volumes changes in fuel sales volumes were primarily due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic which resulted in restricted travel social distancing and reduced business operations in addition fuel sales volumes decreased as a result of an agreement between speedway and pilot travel centers “ptc” effective october 1 2019 in which ptc supplies prices and sells diesel fuel at certain speedway and ptc locations with both companies sharing in the diesel fuel margins 

beginning august 2 2020 in accordance with asc 360 property plant and equipment we ceased recording depreciation and amortization for speedway’s property plant and equipment finitelived intangible assets and right of use lease assets as a result speedway depreciation and amortization was 244 million and 413 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the speedway fuel margin increased to 3452 cents per gallon in 2020 compared with 2434 cents per gallon in 2019 

2019 compared to 2018 

income from discontinued operations net of tax increased 133 million primarily due to higher fuel and merchandise margins largely related to the addition of the andeavor retail operations these increases were partially offset by increases in operating expenses and depreciation primarily related to the locations acquired from andeavor 

the speedway fuel margin increased to 2434 cents per gallon in 2019 compared with 2122 cents per gallon in 2018

2020 compared to 2019 

refining  marketing segment revenues decreased 4116 billion primarily due to lower refined product sales volumes which decreased 513 mbpd and decreased average refined product sales prices of 055 per gallon 

refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 82 percent during 2020 and net refinery throughputs decreased 529 mbpd primarily due to reducing throughputs during the covid19 pandemic 

refining  marketing segment income from operations decreased 805 billion primarily driven by lower blended crack spreads 

refining  marketing margin excluding lifo liquidation charge was 896 per barrel for 2020 compared to 1477 per barrel for 2019 refining  marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput we estimate a net negative impact of 975 billion on refining  marketing margin primarily due to lower crack spreads our reported refining  marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices rin prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances direct dealer fuel margin and for 2020 a lifo liquidation charge of 561 million for 2019 the refining  marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of 93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018 these factors had an estimated net positive impact on refining  marketing segment income from operations of

for the year ended december 31 2020 refining operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization were 537 billion this was a decrease of 106 billion and a per barrel increase of 002 due to lower refinery throughput compared to the year ended december 31 2019 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of covid19 including operating at lower throughput at our refineries and idling portions of our refining capacity net refinery throughput was 529 mbpd lower in 2020 

distribution costs excluding depreciation and amortization were 508 billion and 513 billion for 2020 and 2019 respectively and include fees paid to mplx of 346 billion and 322 billion for 2020 and 2019 respectively on a per barrel basis distribution costs excluding depreciation and amortization increased 085 primarily due to lower throughput partially offset by a decrease in costs 

refining planned turnaround costs increased 92 million or 023 per barrel due to the timing of turnaround activity and a decrease in throughput 

depreciation and amortization per barrel increased by 038 primarily due to a decrease in throughput and increased costs 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 606 million in 2020 and 356 million in 2019 and are included in refining  marketing margin the increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher weighted average rin costs partially offset by a decrease in our rin obligations 

2019 compared to 2018 

refining  marketing segment revenues increased 246 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes which increased 1032 mbpd largely due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 partially offset by decreased average refined product sales prices of 09 per gallon 

refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 96 percent during 2019 and net refinery throughputs increased 838 mbpd primarily due to the refineries acquired from andeavor 

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 202 million primarily due to a full year of direct dealer sales and an increase in refining  marketing margin on a per barrel basis partially offset by higher operating distribution and depreciation and amortization costs the increases in costs and expenses were primarily due to increased sales and production volumes following the andeavor acquisition 

refining  marketing margin was 1477 per barrel for 2019 compared to 1450 per barrel for 2018 refining  marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput we estimate a net positive impact of 446 billion on refining  marketing margin primarily due to an approximate 535 billion benefit from increased throughput volume mainly attributed to the andeavor acquisition partially offset by narrower sour and sweet crude oil differentials our reported refining  marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices rin prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances and direct dealer fuel margin for 2019 the refining  marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of 93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018 these factors had an estimated net positive impact on refining  marketing segment income from operations of approximately 370 million in 2019 compared to 2018 resulting in a capture rate of 96 percent in 2019 compared to 92 percent in 2018

refineries which generally have higher operating costs than other regions in which we operate due to specific geographical location and regulatory factors 

refining planned turnaround costs decreased 76 million or 015 per barrel due to the timing of turnaround activity 

depreciation and amortization per barrel increased by 013 primarily due to the fair value of assets acquired from andeavor as of october 1 2018 during 2019 we recorded a 001 per barrel adjustment to reduce depreciation and amortization which reflects the cumulative effects related to a measurement period adjustment arising from the finalization of purchase accounting 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 356 million in 2019 and 316 million in 2018 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in our rin obligations resulting from the acquisition of andeavor partially offset by lower weighted average rin costs

nongaap financial measures 

management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with gaap we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to their most comparable gaap financial measures they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the nongaap financial measures we use are as follows 

refining  marketing margin 

refining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes other items reflected in the table below

mpc excluding mplx 

we control mplx through our ownership of the general partner however the creditors of mplx do not have recourse to mpc’s general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements the assets of mplx can only be used to settle its own obligations and its creditors have no recourse to our assets therefore in the following table we present the liquidity of mpc excluding mplx mplx liquidity is discussed in the following section 

our liquidity excluding mplx totaled 73 billion at december 31 2020 consisting of 



a outstanding borrowings include 1 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility excludes mplx’s 35 billion bank revolving credit facility which had 175 million borrowings and no of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2020 

b in february 2021 we elected to cancel one of the 10 b 364day revolving credit agreements prior to its maturity in april 2021 

c availability under our 750 million trade receivables facility is a function of eligible trade receivables which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products

e includes cash and cash equivalents classified as assets held for sale of 140 million see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5 and excludes 15 million of mplx cash and cash equivalents 

because of the alternatives available to us including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets including a commercial paper program we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm and longterm funding requirements including capital spending programs dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions

repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies during the year ended december 31 2020 share repurchases were temporarily suspended which has helped preserve our liquidity during the covid19 pandemic the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be initiated suspended or discontinued at any time 

on august 2 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell speedway our companyowned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business to 7eleven for 21 billion in cash subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash debt and working capital at closing and certain other items the taxable transaction is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2021 subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals this transaction is expected to result in aftertax cash proceeds of approximately 165 billion the company expects to use the proceeds from the sale to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders 

additionally we have recorded an income tax receivable within other current assets in our balance sheet of approximately 21 billion which is expected to be received during the second half of 2021 

we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of 2 billion in commercial paper outstanding with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities at december 31 2020 we had 102 billion outstanding under the commercial paper program which matures on various dates in the first quarter of 2021

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity capital resources and results of operations even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the offbalance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources 

we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees in conjunction with our spinoff from marathon oil we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil these arrangements are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 29

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers 

our environmental expenditures including nonregulatory expenditures for each of the last three years were 



a based on the american petroleum institute’s definition of environmental expenditures 

b these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves where permissible but exclude noncash provisions recorded for environmental remediation 

we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 6 percent 12 percent and 11 percent of capital expenditures for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively excluding acquisitions our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 39 million or 2 percent of total planned capital expenditures in 2021 actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

• level 1 – observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 

• level 2 – observable marketbased inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data these are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date 

• level 3 – unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value 

valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 20 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 

• assessment of impairment of longlived assets 

• assessment of impairment of intangible assets 

• assessment of impairment of goodwill 

• assessment of impairment of equity method investments 

• recorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions and 

• recorded values of derivative instruments

impairment assessments of longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions including 

• future operating performance  our estimates of future operating performance are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors which include among other things industrywide capacity our planned utilization rate enduser demand capital expenditures and economic conditions such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews 

• future volumes  our estimates of future refinery pipeline throughput and natural gas and natural gas liquid processing volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our refining  marketing and midstream segments operations personnel assumptions about the effects of covid19 on our future volumes are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic which is difficult to forecast 

• discount rate commensurate with the risks involved  we apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors including market and economic conditions operational risk regulatory risk and political risk this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions if possible a higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows 

• future capital requirements  these are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts 

assumptions about the effects of covid19 and the macroeconomic environment are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the macroeconomic environment which is difficult to forecast we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a weakened outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes a significant reduction in natural gas or natural gas liquids processed a significant reduction in refining margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment the following sections detail our critical accounting estimates related to impairment assessments for longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments 

longlived asset impairment assessments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value the company’s consolidated longlived asset balance was 43 billion as of december 31 2020 

during the first quarter of 2020 we identified longlived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the refining  marketing segment as a result of decreases to the refining  marketing segment expected future cash flows the cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by the effects of covid19 and commodity price declines we assessed each refinery asset group for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows to the carrying value of each asset group of the 16 refinery asset groups only the gallup refinery’s carrying value exceeded its undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows it was determined that the fair value of the gallup refinery’s property plant and equipment was less than the carrying value as a result we recorded a charge of 142 million in the first quarter of 2020 to impairment expense on the consolidated statements of income the fair value measurements for the gallup refinery assets represent level 3 measurements 

table of contents 

during the second quarter of 2020 we identified longlived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the refining  marketing segment except the gallup refinery which had been impaired in the first quarter as a result of continued macroeconomic developments impacting the refining  marketing segment expected future cash flows all of these refinery asset groups undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows exceeded the carrying value by at least 17 percent 

on august 3 2020 we announced our plans to evaluate possibilities to strategically reposition our martinez refinery including the potential conversion of the refinery into a renewable diesel facility subsequent to august 3 2020 we progressed activities associated with the conversion of the martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility including applying for permits advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers and beginning detailed engineering activities as envisioned the martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022 with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023 as a result of the progression of these activities we identified assets that would be repurposed and utilized in a renewable diesel facility configuration and assets that would be abandoned since they had no function in a renewable diesel facility configuration this change in our intended use for the martinez refinery is a longlived asset impairment trigger for the assets that would be repurposed and remain as part of the martinez asset group we assessed the asset group for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows exceeded the martinez asset group carrying value we recorded impairment expense of 342 million for the abandoned assets as we are no longer using these assets and have no expectation to use these assets in the future additionally as a result of our efforts to progress the conversion of martinez refinery into a renewable diesel facility mplx cancelled inprocess capital projects related to its martinez refinery logistics operations resulting in impairments of 27 million in the third quarter 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we concluded the evaluation of our intended use of mplx terminal assets near the gallup refinery and determined that the assets were abandoned resulting in an impairment charge of 67 million following this conclusion we revised the estimate of the salvage value for the gallup refinery asset group resulting in an additional 44 million impairment charge these charges are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income 

the determination of undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for our longlived asset impairment tests utilized significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows allocation of certain refining  marketing segment cash flows to the individual refineries the estimated useful lives of the asset groups and the salvage values of the refineries the determinations of expected future cash flows and the salvage values of refineries require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future should our assumptions significantly change in future periods it is possible we may determine the carrying values of additional refinery asset groups exceed the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows of their refinery asset groups which would result in future impairment charges 

during the first quarter of 2020 mplx identified an impairment trigger relating to asset groups within its western gathering  processing “gp” reporting unit as a result of significant changes to expected future cash flows for these asset groups resulting from the effects of covid19 the cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by volume declines reflecting decreased forecasted producer customer production as a result of lower commodity prices mplx assessed each asset group within the western gp reporting unit for impairment it was determined that the fair value of the east texas gp asset group’s underlying assets was less than the carrying value as a result mplx recorded impairment charges totaling 350 million related to its property plant and equipment and intangibles which are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income fair value of mplx’s ppe was determined using a combination of an income and cost approach the income approach utilized significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows and the estimated useful life of the asset group the cost approach utilized assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar assets adjusted for estimated depreciation and deterioration of the existing equipment the fair value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multiperiod excess earnings method which is an income approach key assumptions included management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows from existing customers customer attrition rates and the discount rate fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the

goodwill impairment assessments 

unlike longlived assets goodwill is subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing at the reporting unit level a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value without exceeding the recorded amount of goodwill as of december 31 2020 we had a total of 826 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet which was associated with four of our eight reporting units an additional reporting unit speedway has goodwill of 44 billion and is reported within assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets 

the outbreak of covid19 its development into a pandemic and the decline in commodity prices during the first quarter of 2020 had significant effects on our business see “business update” in item 1 business above due to these developments we performed impairment assessments during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed further below 

prior to performing our goodwill impairment assessment as of march 31 2020 we had goodwill totaling approximately 20 billion associated with eight of our 10 reporting units as part of this assessment we recorded goodwill impairment of 733 billion in the first quarter of 2020 related to our refining  marketing and mplx’s eastern gathering  processing reporting units the refining  marketing and eastern gathering  processing reporting units recorded goodwill impairment charges of 552 billion and 181 billion respectively which fully impaired both reporting units’ historical goodwill balances these goodwill impairment expenses are primarily driven by the effects of covid19 the decline in commodity prices and the slowing of drilling activity which has reduced production growth forecasts from mplx’s producer customers for the remaining six reporting units with goodwill we determined that no significant adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary the impairment assessment performed as of march 31 2020 resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 85 percent to 2700 percent mplx’s crude gathering reporting unit had goodwill totaling 11 billion at march 31 2020 and mplx’s fair value estimate for this reporting unit exceeded the reporting unit carrying value by 85 percent the operations that make up this reporting unit were acquired by mplx when it acquired andx we accounted for the october 1 2018 acquisition of andeavor through which we acquired control of andx using the acquisition method of accounting which required andeavor assets and liabilities to be recorded at the acquisition date fair value as such given the short amount of time from when fair value was established to the date of the impairment test the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value within this reporting unit is not unexpected an increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit would not have resulted in goodwill impairment as of march 31 2020 no other reporting units had fair values exceeding carrying values of less than 20 percent 

prior to performing our annual impairment assessment as of november 30 2020 mpc had goodwill totaling approximately 826 billion associated with four reporting units additionally a fifth reporting unit speedway is reported in assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets and has 44 billion of goodwill management performed a qualitative assessment for three reporting units as we determined it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values a quantitative assessment was last performed on these reporting units either on november 30 2019 or march 31 2020 and these reporting units’ fair values exceeded carrying values by a range of approximately 90 percent to 270 percent a quantitative assessment was performed for the remaining two reporting units which resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 9 percent to 42 percent the reporting unit whose fair value exceeded its carrying amount by 9 percent our crude gathering reporting unit had goodwill totaling 11 billion at december 31 2020 the excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit is consistent with prior assessments an increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit would not have resulted in goodwill impairment as of november 30 2020 

significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units’ fair value included estimates of future cash flows and market information for comparable assets if estimates for future cash flows which are impacted by future margins on products produced or sold future volumes and capital requirements were to decline the overall reporting units’ fair values would decrease resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying

assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 

equity method investment impairment assessment 

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value during the first quarter of 2020 we recorded 132 billion of equity method investment impairment charges to income from equity method investments in the consolidated statements of income the impairment charges primarily related to mplx recording an other than temporary impairment totaling 126 billion of which 125 billion related to markwest utica emg llc and its investment in ohio gathering company llc the fair value of the investments was determined based upon applying the discounted cash flow method which is an income approach the discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date the significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows including prices and volumes the weighted average cost of capital and the longterm growth rate fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as such the fair value of these equity method investments represents a level 3 measurement as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future the impairment was recorded through “income from equity method investments” the impairments were largely due to a reduction in forecasted volumes gathered and processed by the systems operated by the joint ventures at december 31 2020 we had 542 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17 for additional information on our equity method investments see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19 for additional information on our goodwill and intangibles including a table summarizing our recorded goodwill by segment 

acquisitions 

in accounting for business combinations acquired assets assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired if any is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain respectively a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property plant and equipment intangible assets contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and for certain acquisitions engage thirdparty consultants for valuation assistance 

the fair value of assets and liabilities including contingent consideration as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches including the income approach which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate the cost approach which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entityspecific differences the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ materially from the projected results used to determine fair value 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8 for additional information on our acquisitions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 20 for additional information on fair value measurements 

table of contents 

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 20 additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

variable interest entities 

we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests variable interests can be contractual ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie’s assets when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated 

significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie we evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest andor if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group we continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions 

changes in the design or nature of the activities of a vie or our involvement with a vie may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity’s status as a vie andor our status as the primary beneficiary such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization this could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary which would have a significant impact on our financial statements 

variable interest entities are discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 9 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 

• the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations 

• the expected longterm return on plan assets 

• the rate of future increases in compensation levels 

• health care cost projections and 

• the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations 

we utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for each of our pension plans and retiree health and welfare based on the projected benefit payment patterns of each individual plan the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indices for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuaries’ discount rate models these models calculate an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using yield curves derived from aa or higher corporate bond yields the yield curves represent a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

table of contents 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 255 percent for our pension plans and 260 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 110 million and 42 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 15 million and 3 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 50 percent equity securities and 50 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness we used the 600 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2020 defined benefit pension expense after evaluating activity in the capital markets along with the current and projected plan investments we decreased the asset rate of return for our primary plan to 575 percent effective for 2021 decreasing the 575 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percentage points would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 5 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

we utilized the 2020 mortality tables from the us society of actuaries

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2020 we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 20 and 21 for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

refining  marketing 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below lifo inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts but we also enter into overthecounter swaps options and overthecounter options we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

midstream 

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond mplx’s control mplx may at times use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to economically hedge commodity price risk a portion of mplx’s profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of purchasing and selling ngls and natural gas at indexrelated prices to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of drilling by mplx producer customers such prices also indirectly affect profitability mplx may enter into derivative contracts which are primarily swaps traded on the otc market as well as fixed price forward contracts mplx’s risk management policy does not allow it to enter into speculative positions with its derivative contracts execution of mplx’s hedge strategy and the continuous monitoring of commodity markets and its open derivative positions are carried out by its hedge committee comprised of members of senior management 

to mitigate mplx’s cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of ngls it may use ngl derivative swap contracts a small portion of its ngl price exposure may be managed by using crude oil contracts to mitigate mplx’s cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas it may use natural gas 

table of contents 

derivative swap contracts taking into account the partial offset of its long and short natural gas positions resulting from normal operating activities 

mplx would be exposed to additional commodity risk in certain situations such as if producers under‑deliver or over‑deliver products or if processing facilities are operated in different recovery modes in the event that mplx has derivative positions in excess of the product delivered or expected to be delivered the excess derivative positions may be terminated 

mplx management conducts a standard credit review on counterparties to derivative contracts and it has provided the counterparties with a guaranty as credit support for its obligations mplx uses standardized agreements that allow for offset of certain positive and negative exposures in the event of default or other terminating events including bankruptcy 

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis

sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2020 is provided in the following table 



we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2020 would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

our use of fixed or variablerate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk fixed rate debt such as our senior notes exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates or that our current fixed rate debt may be higher than the current market variablerate debt such as borrowings under our revolving credit facilities exposes us to shortterm changes in market rates that impact our interest expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22 for additional information on our debt

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 20 for additional information on the fair value of our debt 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2020 

counterparty risk 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment by our customers to whom we provide services lease assets or sell natural gas or ngls we believe that certain contracts would allow us to pass those losses through to our customers thus reducing our risk when we are selling ngls and acting as our producer customers’ agent our credit exposure related to these customers is represented by the value of our trade receivables or lease receivables where exposed to credit risk we analyze the customer’s financial condition prior to entering into a transaction or agreement establish credit terms and monitor the appropriateness of these terms on an ongoing basis in the event of a customer default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative contracts our credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date outstanding instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements should the creditworthiness of one or more of our counterparties decline our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party in the event of a counterparty default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted

 item 1 business 

overview 

marathon petroleum corporation “mpc” has over 130 years of experience in the energy business and is the largest independent petroleum product refining marketing retail and midstream business in the united states we operate the nations largest refining system with more than 3 million barrels per day of crude oil refining capacity and believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers in the united states we believe we operate the second largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states we distribute our refined products through one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges in addition our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and ngls from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets 

our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing retail and midstream each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers 

 on october 1 2018 we completed the andeavor acquisition andeavor shareholders received in the aggregate approximately 2398 million shares of mpc common stock valued at 198 billion and 35 billion in cash 

andeavor was a highly integrated marketing logistics and refining company operating primarily in the western and midcontinent united states our acquisition of andeavor in 2018 substantially increased our geographic diversification and the scale of our assets which provides increased opportunities to optimize our system 

corporate history and structure 

mpc was incorporated in delaware on november 9 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of marathon oil corporation “marathon oil” on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its refining marketing  transportation business into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil on june 30 2011 our common stock trades on the nyse under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

recent developments 

strategic actions to enhance shareholder value 

on october 31 2019 we announced our intention to separate our retail transportation fuel and convenience store business which is operated primarily under the speedway brand into an independent publicly traded company through a taxfree distribution to mpc shareholders of publicly traded stock in the new independent retail transportation fuel and convenience store company this transaction is targeted to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 subject to market regulatory and certain other conditions including final approval by mpc’s board of directors receipt of customary assurances regarding the intended taxfree nature of the transaction and the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the sec the speedway business is currently a reporting unit within our retail segment mpc will retain its direct dealer business which is also included in the retail segment as currently reported 

mpc’s board of directors also formed a special committee to evaluate strategies to enhance shareholder value through a review of the midstream business and to analyze among other things the strategic fit of assets with mpc the ability to realize full valuation credit for midstream earnings and cash flow balance sheet impacts including liquidity and credit ratings transaction tax impacts separation costs and overall complexity 

mplx acquisition of andx 

on july 30 2019 mplx completed its acquisition of andeavor logistics lp “andx” and andx survived as a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx at the effective time of the merger each common unit held by andx’s public unitholders was converted into the right to receive 1135 mplx common units andx common units held by certain affiliates of mpc were converted into the right to receive 10328 mplx common units additionally 600000 andx preferred units were converted into 600000 preferred units of mplx the “series b preferred units” series b preferred unitholders are entitled to receive when and if declared by the mplx board a fixed distribution of 6875 per unit per annum payable semiannually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 or the first business day thereafter up to and including february 15 2023 after february 15 2023 the holders of series b preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly distributions payable in arrears on the 15th day of february may august and november of each year or the first business day thereafter based on a floating annual rate equal to the three month libor plus 4652 percent 

the transaction simplified our two sponsored mlps mplx and andx into a single listed entity to create a leading largescale diversified midstream company anchored by feebased cash flows the combined entity has an expanded geographic footprint that is expected to enhance its longterm growth opportunities and the sustainable cash flow profile of the business

we own a fleet of transport trucks and trailers for the movement of refined products and crude oil in addition we maintain a fleet of leased and owned railcars for the movement and storage of refined products 

the locations and detailed information about our refining  marketing assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of refined products based upon company data as reported in the “the oil  gas journal 2019 worldwide refinery survey” we ranked first among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity 

we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale including exports spot branded and retail distribution our marketing operations compete with numerous other independent marketers integrated oil companies and highvolume retailers we compete with companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market and refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded independent entrepreneurs in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and retail consumers 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils ans wti and lls crude oils and other market structure impacts also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for our refining  marketing segment for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

retail 

our retail segment sells gasoline diesel and merchandise through convenience stores that it owns and operates primarily under the speedway brand and gasoline and diesel through direct dealer locations our companyowned and operated convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items speedway’s speedy rewards ® loyalty program has been a highly successful loyalty program since its inception in 2004 which averaged approximately 63 million active members in 2019  speedway’s ability to capture and analyze memberspecific transactional data enables us to offer speedy rewards ® members discounts and promotions specific to their buying behavior we believe speedy rewards ® is a key reason customers choose speedway over competitors and it continues to drive significant value for both speedway and our speedy rewards ® members 

as of december 31 2019  our retail segment had 3898 companyowned and operated convenience stores across the united states and we have longterm supply contracts for 1068 direct dealer locations primarily in southern california largely under the arco ® brand 

speedway also owns a 29 percent interest in pfj southeast llc “pfj southeast” which is a joint venture between speedway and pilot flying j with 125 travel center locations primarily in the southeast united states as of december 31 2019  additionally speedway and pilot travel centers llc “ptc” entered into an agreement effective october 1 2019 in which ptc will supply price and sell diesel fuel at certain speedway and ptc locations with both companies sharing in the diesel fuel margins at december 31 2019  this agreement included approximately 330 speedway and ptc fueling locations across 13 states including approximately 180 speedway commercial fueling locations 

the locations and detailed information about our retail assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

we face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies independent entrepreneurs and other wellrecognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers often selling gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise at competitive prices nontraditional transportation fuel retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have affected the convenience store industry with their 

entrance into sales of retail gasoline and diesel fuel energy analysts international inc estimated such retailers had approximately 16 percent of the us gasoline market in 2019  

demand for gasoline and diesel fuel is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic as a result the operating results for our retail segment for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel 

midstream 

the midstream segment primarily includes the operations of mplx our sponsored mlp and certain related operations retained by mpc 

mplx 

mplx owns and operates a network of crude oil natural gas and refined product pipelines and has joint ownership interests in other crude oil and refined products pipelines mplx also owns and operates light products terminals storage assets and maintains a fleet of owned and leased towboats and barges mplx’s assets also include natural gas gathering systems and natural gas processing and ngl fractionation complexes 

mpcretained midstream assets and investments 

we have ownership interests in several crude oil and refined products pipeline systems and pipeline companies and have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures through our investment in crowley coastal partners 

the locations and detailed information about our midstream assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

our midstream operations face competition for natural gas gathering crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services in obtaining unprocessed ngls for gathering and fractionation and in marketing our products and services competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants operating efficiency and reliability and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of capacity proximity to supply and industry marketing centers and cost efficiency and reliability of service competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and ngls is based primarily on price delivery capabilities flexibility and maintenance of highquality customer relationships in addition certain of our midstream operations are highly regulated which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

our midstream segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and ngls and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year 

environmental matters 

our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for reviewing our overall environmental performance we also have a corporate emergency response team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to greenhouse gas emissions climate change and climate adaptation will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review discussion or implementation the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant for additional information see item 1a risk factors we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations additionally we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment such laws and regulations include among others the clean air act “caa” with respect to air emissions the clean water act “cwa” with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized

air 

greenhouse gas emissions 

we are subject to many requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations internationally and domestically emphasis has been placed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in july 2019 the trump administration continued its shift in climaterelated policy away from the obama administration’s policies by repealing the “clean power plan” and replacing it with the affordable clean energy rule which establishes guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coalfired power plants president trump also announced the united states’ intention to withdraw from the 2015 paris un climate change conference agreement which aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees celsius as compared to preindustrial levels many of the policies and regulations rescinded through executive order 13783 had been adopted to meet the united states’ pledge under the paris agreement the us climate change strategy and implementation of that strategy through legislation and regulation may change under future administrations therefore the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time 

in the absence of federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions states are becoming active in regulating greenhouse gas emissions these measures may include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions these measures may also include lowcarbon fuel standards such as the california program or a state carbon tax these measures could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented for example in 2017 the california state legislature adopted ab 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in sb 32 compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a marketbased credit system the carb is now exploring the potential for additional greenhouse gas reductions by 2045 via a yet undefined carbon neutrality standard much of the compliance costs associated with these california regulations are ultimately passed on to the consumer in the form of higher fuel costs we cannot currently predict the impact of these regulations on our liquidity financial position or results of operations but we do not believe such impact will be material 

in sum requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments these requirements may also significantly affect mpc’s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the extent and magnitude of the impact from greenhouse gas regulation or legislation cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 

regardless of whether legislation or regulation is enacted given the continuing global demand for oil and gas  even under different hypothetical carbonconstrained scenarios  mpc has taken actions that have resulted in lower greenhouse gas emission intensity and we believe we are positioned to remain a successful company well into the future we have instituted a program to improve energy efficiency of our refineries and other assets which will continue to pay dividends in reducing our environmental footprint as well as making us more costcompetitive we believe our mature governance and riskmanagement processes enable the company to effectively monitor and adjust to any transitional reputational or physical climaterelated risks 

other air emissions 

in 2015 united states environmental protection agency “epa” finalized a revision to the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for ozone the epa lowered the primary ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to 70 ppb this revision initiated a multiyear process in which nonattainment designations will be made based on more recent ozone measurements that includes data from 2016 on november 6 2017 the epa finalized ozone attainmentunclassifiable designations for certain areas under the new standard in actions dated april 30 2018 and july 25 2018 the epa finalized nonattainment designations for certain areas under the lower primary ozone standard in some areas these nonattainment designations could result in increased costs associated with or result in cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities for areas designated nonattainment states will be required to adopt state implementation plans “sips” for nonattainment areas these sips may include nox andor volatile organic compound “voc” reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities we cannot predict the effects of the various sips requirements at this time 

in california the board for the south coast air quality management district “scaqmd” passed amendments to the regional clean air incentives market “reclaim” that became effective in 2016 requiring a staged reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 in 2017 the state of california passed ab 617 which requires each air district that is a nonattainment area for one or more air pollutants to adopt an expedited schedule for implementation of best available retrofit control technology “barct” on specific facilities barct applies to all facilities subject to reclaim in response to ab 617 the scaqmd is currently working to “sunset” the existing reclaim program and replace it with applicable barct regulations a “sunset” of the reclaim program and application of barct could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities or install emissions controls at our facilities in the scaqmd 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other things requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances opa90 also requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages and provides for civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we operate tank vessels and facilities from which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements 

additionally opa90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be doublehulled and that existing tank vessels that are not doublehulled be retrofitted or removed from us service all barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the doublehulled requirements of opa90 some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

on october 22 2019 the epa and the united states army corps of engineers “army corps” published a final rule to repeal the 2015 “clean water rule definition of waters of the united states” “2015 rule” which amended portions of the code of federal regulations “cfr” to restore the regulatory text that existed prior to the 2015 rule effective december 23 2019 the rule repealing the 2015 clean water rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts on january 23 2020 the epa and the army corps finalized the navigable waters protection rule “2020 rule” to define “waters of the united states” this rule will become effective 60 days after publication in the federal register and will replace the pre2015 regulatory text that had been restored by the october 2019 rule the 2020 rule will likely be challenged in court a broader definition of “waters of the united states” such as that included in the 2015 rule could result in increased cost of compliance or increased capital costs for construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities 

in 2015 the epa issued its intent to review the cwa categorical effluent limitation guidelines “elg” for the petroleum refining sector during 2017 the epa prepared and issued an information request “icr” requesting significant wastewater and treatment process details from select refineries seven of which were ours responses to the icr were submitted to the epa in early 2018 in september 2019 the epa issued its “detailed study of the petroleum refining category  2019 report” which concluded the epa’s review in october 2019 the epa published its “preliminary effluent guidelines program plan 14” “plan 14” and requested comments plan 14 indicated that the epa was proposing to conclude the study of the petroleum 

refinery category and not take further action at this time however it also indicated that it intended a future review or study of the category but did not elaborate on scope or timing of such review or study changes in the elg could result in increased costs of compliance including capital improvement projects at our facilities 

as part of our emergency response activities we have used aqueous film forming foam “afff” containing per and polyfluoroalkyl substances “pfas” chemicals as a fire suppressant at this time afffs containing pfas are the only proven foams that can prevent and control most flammable petroleumbased liquid fires 

in may 2016 the epa issued lifetime health advisories “has” and health effects support documents for two pfas substances  perfluorooctanoic acid “pfoa” and perfluorooctane sulfonate “pfos” the epa’s has which identify the concentration of pfoa and pfos in drinking water at or below which adverse health effects are not anticipated to occur over a lifetime of exposure are 007 parts per billion 70 parts per trillion for pfoa and pfos has are nonregulatory and reflect the epa’s assessment of the best available peerreviewed science 

in february 2019 epa issued a pfas action plan identifying actions the epa is planning to take to study and regulate various pfas chemicals the epa identified that it would evaluate among other actions 1 proposing national drinking water standards for pfoa and pfos 2 develop cleanup recommendations for pfoa and pfos 3 evaluate listing pfoa and pfos as hazardous substances under cercla and 4 conduct toxicity assessments for other pfas chemicals in february 2020 the epa announced its preliminary determinations to regulate pfos and pfoa in drinking water and is taking public comment on such preliminary determinations if the preliminary determinations become final the epa will set drinking water limits for pfos and pfoa 

congress has introduced multiple bills in the house and senate proposing to regulate pfas to date only one such bill has been signed into law the national defense authorization act includes provisions that added certain pfas to the toxics release inventory under the emergency planning and community righttoknow act facilities that manufacture process or produce listed pfas in quantities of more than 100 pounds per year will be required to report their releases of pfas we expect further congressional action or epa action in the future however it is unknown at this time what future legislation andor regulation will entail 

in addition many states are actively proposing and adopting legislation and regulations relating to the use of afff additionally some states are adopting and proposing statespecific drinking water and cleanup standards for various pfas we cannot currently predict the impact of these regulations on our liquidity financial position or results of operations 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of usts containing regulated substances 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain convenience stores and other locations where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the applicable state laws and regulations a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during 

which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

renewable fuels and other fuels requirements 

the us congress passed the energy independence and security act of 2007 “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” jointly adopted regulations that increased the mile per gallon standards for passenger cars and light trucks through model year 2025 in 2018 the epa and the nhtsa jointly proposed the safer affordable fuelefficient vehicles rules for model years 20212026 which would propose new corporate average fuel economy “cafe” standards for model years 2022 through 2026 amend the 2021 model year cafe standards amend the epa’s carbon dioxide emission standards for model years 2021 through 2025 and establish new carbon dioxide emission standards for model year 2026 the epa’s preferred alternative is to retain the model year 2020 standards for both programs through model year 2026 the standards established by the final regulation may differ higher cafe standards for cars and light trucks have the potential to reduce demand for our transportation fuels 

in addition the nhtsa and the epa issued rules providing that the energy policy and conservation act “epca” preempts state regulations of tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions withdrew the waiver granted to california for its advanced clean car program and determined that the clean air act permits other states to adopt only those california standards that are designed to control traditional “criteria pollutants” california may establish per its clean air act waiver authority different standards that could apply in multiple states new or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations 

pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the eisa the epa has promulgated a renewable fuel standard “rfs” program that requires certain volumes of renewable fuel be blended with our products eisa requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 360 billion gallons by 2022 within the total volume of renewable fuel eisa established nested categories of renewable fuel advanced biofuel biomassbased diesel and cellulosic biofuel 

by november 30 of each year the epa is required to promulgate the annual renewable fuel standards for the following compliance year in a legal challenge to the 20142016 volumes the dc circuit court of appeals vacated the total renewable volume for 2016 and remanded to the epa for reconsideration consistent with the court’s opinion a rule that increases the total renewable volume for any compliance year to make up for the 2016 shortfall could increase our cost of compliance with the rfs program require us to use carryover rins and be detrimental to the rin market 

the epa has finalized the annual renewable fuel standards for the year 2020 for the first time the epa has proposed to reallocate to nonexempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners that were granted a small refinery exemption also the tenth circuit court of appeals recently held that a small refinery is eligible for an exemption from the rfs only if it is applying for an extension of its original exemption according to the epa’s data seven refineries were granted the small refinery exemption in 2015 the epa granted 19 small refinery exemptions in 2016 35 exemptions in 2017 and 31 exemptions in 2018 a lawsuit challenging the 2018 small refinery exemption letter is currently pending in the dc circuit court of appeals and similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future the reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the rin bank an increase in the price of rins or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend any of which could increase mpc’s rfs cost of compliance 

the rfs is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline vehicle regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline “e10” since 2016 the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the e10 blendwall which will require obligated parties to either sell e15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed historical levels or retire carryover rins 

there is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the rins sold on the open market we have developed a rin integrity program to vet the rins that we purchase and we incur costs to audit rin 

generators nevertheless if any of the rins that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be invalid we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid rins 

in addition to the federal renewable fuel standards certain states have or are considering promulgation of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards for example california began implementing its low carbon fuel standard “lcfs” in january 2011 in september 2015 the carb approved the readoption of the lcfs which became effective on january 1 2016 to address procedural deficiencies in the way the original regulation was adopted the lcfs was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030 the carb is now exploring the imposition of a 50 renewable fuel requirement for diesel low emission diesel sold in california by 2030 we incur costs to comply with the california lcfs and these costs may increase if the cost of lcfs credits increases 

in sum the rfs has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use we may experience a decrease in demand for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced by renewable fuels demand for our refined products also may decrease as a result of low carbon fuel standard programs or electric vehicle mandates 

tribal lands 

various federal agencies including the epa and the department of the interior along with certain native american tribes promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on native american tribal lands where we operate these regulations include such matters as lease provisions drilling and production requirements and standards to protect environmental quality and cultural resources for example the epa has established a preconstruction permitting program for new and modified minor sources throughout native american tribal lands and new and modified major sources in nonattainment areas in those areas in addition each native american tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal state and local statutes and regulations these laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on native american tribal lands and impact the viability of or prevent or delay our ability to conduct our operations on such lands 

trademarks patents and licenses 

o ur marathon trademark is material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations and our speedway and arco trademarks are material to the conduct of our retail operations additionally the retail and marketing businesses we acquired in the andeavor acquisition primarily use the shell ® and mobil ® brands for fuel sales and ampm ® and giant ® brands for convenience store merchandise we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole in general we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of knowhow rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations 

employees 

we had approximately 60910 regular fulltime and parttime employees as of december 31 2019  which includes approximately 40390 employees of our retail segment 

approximately 4650 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements of these employees approximately 190 employees at our st paul park refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 approximately 280 employees at our el paso refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in april 2021 approximately 3425 employees at our anacortes canton catlettsburg galveston bay los angeles mandan martinez and salt lake city refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire in early 2022 the remaining 750 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate while others relate to the ownership of our common stock 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins which are dependent on factors beyond our control 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products historically refining and marketing margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market factors that are beyond our control including 

 some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks can have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products can have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing margins may lead us to reduce the amount of refined products we produce which may reduce our revenues income from operations and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures impair the carrying value of our assets such as property plant and equipment inventory or goodwill and decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend 

legal technological political and scientific developments regarding emissions and fuel efficiency may decrease demand for transportation fuels 

developments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions may decrease the demand or increase the cost for our transportation fuels attitudes toward these products and their relationship to the environment may significantly affect our effectiveness in marketing our products government efforts to steer the public toward nonpetroleumbased fuel dependent modes of transportation may foster a negative perception toward transportation fuels or increase costs for our products thus affecting the public’s attitude toward our major product advanced technology and increased use of vehicles that do not use petroleumbased transportation 

fuels or that are powered by hybrid engines would reduce demand for motor fuel we may also incur increased costs for our products which we may not be able to pass along to our customers these developments could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions such as scheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages severe weather labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as acts of terrorism 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations may result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

in addition we operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive waters where tanker pipeline rail car and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups certain of our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by tanker or barge transportation and storage of crude oil other feedstocks and refined products over and adjacent to water involves inherent risk and subjects us to the provisions of the opa90 and state laws in us coastal and great lakes states and states bordering inland waterways on which we operate as well as international laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate if we are unable to promptly and adequately contain any accident or discharge involving tankers pipelines rail cars or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil other feedstocks or refined products we may be subject to substantial liability in addition the service providers we have contracted to aid us in a discharge response may be unavailable due to weather conditions governmental regulations or other local or global events international federal or state rulings could divert our response resources to other global events 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases cybersecurity breaches or other incidents involving our assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows marine vessel charter agreements may not provide complete indemnity for oil spills and any marine charterer’s liability insurance we carry may not cover all losses historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

we rely on the performance of our information technology systems and the interruption or failure of any information technology system including an interruption or failure due to a cybersecurity breach could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems including our network infrastructure and cloud applications for the safe and effective operation of our business we rely on such systems to process transmit and store electronic information including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee customer investor and payroll data and to manage or support a variety of business processes including our supply chain pipeline operations gathering and processing operations retail sales credit card payments and authorizations at our retail outlets financial transactions banking and numerous other processes and transactions our systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters malware power failures cyberattacks and other events we also face various other cybersecurity threats from criminal hackers statesponsored intrusion industrial espionage and employee malfeasance including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable certain vendors have access to sensitive information including personally 

identifiable customer investor and employee data and a breakdown of their technology systems or infrastructure as a result of a cyberattack or otherwise could result in unauthorized disclosure of such information 

our cybersecurity protections infrastructure protection technologies disaster recovery plans and employee training may not be sufficient to defend us against all unauthorized attempts to access our information we have been and may in the future be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to our computer network and systems to date the impacts of prior events have not had a material adverse effect on us 

any cybersecurity incident could result in theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential financial and other data intellectual property customer awards or loyalty points give rise to remediation or other expenses expose us to liability under federal and state laws reduce our customers’ willingness to do business with us disrupt the services we provide to customers and subject us to litigation and legal liability under federal and state laws any of such results could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

competition in our industry is intense and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business 

we compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies including certain multinational oil companies competitors with integrated operations with exploration and production resources and broader access to resources may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions and to bear the risks inherent in the refining industry for example competitors that engage in exploration and production of crude oil may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

we also face strong competition in the market for the retail sale of transportation fuels and merchandise our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling transportation fuels and merchandise at very competitive prices several nontraditional transportation fuel retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants are in the retail transportation fuels business these nontraditional transportation fuels retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow because of their diversity integration of operations experienced management and significant financial resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market in addition these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts adversely affecting our profit margins additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either transportation fuels or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions in particular pipelines or railroads provide a nearly exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries a prolonged interruption material reduction or cessation of service of such a pipeline or railway whether due to private party or governmental action or other reason or any other prolonged disruption of the ability of the trucks pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners our joint venture partners may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations failure by us or an entity in which we have an interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our inventory risk management activities may result in substantial derivative variability or losses 

we enter into derivative transactions to manage the risks from changes in the prices of crude oil refined products natural gas and other feedstocks associated with our physical inventories and future production and these transactions may result in substantial derivatives variability or losses which could increase the volatility of our earnings we manage price risk on inventories above or below our target levels to minimize the impact commodity price fluctuations have on our earnings and cash flows consequently our results may fluctuate significantly from one reporting period to the next depending on commodity price fluctuations and our relative physical inventory positions these transactions may also expose us to the risk of financial loss for example if our production is less than we anticipated at the time we entered into a hedge agreement or if a counterparty to our hedge agreement fails to perform its obligations under its agreement we may suffer a financial loss 

we have significant debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

at december 31 2019  our total debt obligations for borrowed money and finance lease obligations were 2928 billion  including 2012 billion of obligations of mplx and its subsidiaries we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

 a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant on november 1 2019 moody’s announced it had changed its outlook for mpc’s and mplx’s credit ratings from stable to negative following the announcement of the planned speedway spinoff and midstream review the planned speedway spinoff and midstream review could be factors causing or contributing to a future determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower mpc’s or mplx’s credit rating any changes in our credit capacity or credit profile could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to 750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables in periods of lower prices we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility 

uncertainty relating to the calculation of libor and other reference rates and their potential discontinuance may adversely affect interest expense related to our outstanding debt 

national and international regulators and law enforcement agencies have conducted investigations into a number of rates or indices which are deemed to be “reference rates” actions by such regulators and law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which certain reference rates are determined their discontinuance or the establishment of alternative reference rates in particular it appears highly likely that libor will be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021 

at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor other benchmarks or floating rate indebtedness uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks furthermore the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the market value of the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our floating rate indebtedness to be materially different than expected and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance such floating rate indebtedness or raise future indebtedness on a cost effective basis 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations including those of mplx and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 4650 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements of these employees approximately 190 employees at our st paul park refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 approximately 280 employees at our el paso refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in april 2021 approximately 3425 employees at our anacortes canton catlettsburg galveston bay los angeles mandan martinez and salt lake city refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire in early 2022 the remaining 750 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024 these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us in addition we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition california requires refinery owners to pay prevailing wages to contract craft workers and restricts refiners’ ability to hire qualified employees to a limited pool of applicants legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages higher labor costs and an increased risk that contract employees become joint employees which could trigger bargaining issues employment discrimination liability issues as well as wage and benefit consequences especially during critical maintenance and construction periods 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a master limited partnership which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx a master limited partnership our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if foreign investment in us or mplx exceeds certain levels mplx could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920 collectively the “maritime laws” generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens among other requirements to establish citizenship entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by us citizens if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws mplx would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil pursuant to agreements we entered into in connection with our spinoff from marathon oil which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although our spinoff from marathon oil occurred in mid2011 certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations for example we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that includes provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil following our spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities whether incurred prior to or after our spinoff as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to our spinoff moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

a significant decrease in oil and natural gas production in mplx’s areas of operation whether due to sustained declines in oil natural gas and ngl prices natural declines in well production or otherwise may adversely affect mplx’s business results of operations and financial condition and could reduce its ability to make distributions to us 

a significant portion of mplx’s operations are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production the production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers will naturally decline over time which means that mplx’s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of mplx’s facilities mplx must continually obtain new oil natural gas ngl and refined product supplies which depend in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its system capacity as needed 

we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of mplx’s operations the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline in addition we have no control over producers or their production decisions which are affected by among other things prevailing and projected energy prices drilling costs per mcf or barrel demand for hydrocarbons operational challenges access to downstream markets the level of reserves geological considerations governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital because of these factors even if oil or natural gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by mplx assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves reductions in 

exploration or production activity in mplx’s areas of operations could lead to reduced throughput on its pipelines and utilization rates of its facilities 

decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves the prices for oil natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond our control including global and local demand production levels changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications imports and exports seasonality and weather conditions economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations sustained periods of low prices could result in producers also significantly curtailing or limiting their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil natural gas and ngls to mplx’s facilities and adversely affect their revenues and cash available for distribution to us this impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of mplx’s commoditybased contracts which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and ngl prices than its feebased contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a btu equivalent basis than ngl products in addition the purchase and resale of natural gas and ngls in the ordinary course exposes our midstream operations to volatility in natural gas or ngl prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of production processes also the significant volatility in natural gas ngl and oil prices could adversely impact mplx’s unit price thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital such impacts could adversely impact mplx’s ability to execute its long‑term organic growth projects satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels and may also result in noncash impairments of longlived assets or goodwill or otherthantemporary noncash impairments of our equity method investments 

significant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies as a result stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations could be disrupted if we are unable to maintain or obtain real property rights required for our business 

we do not own all of the land on which certain of our assets are located particularly our midstream assets but rather obtain the rights to construct and operate such assets on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time therefore we are subject to the possibility of more burdensome terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if our leases rightsofway or other property rights lapse terminate or are reduced or it is determined that we do not have valid leases rightsofway or other property rights any loss of or reduction in these rights including loss or reduction due to legal governmental or other actions or difficulty renewing leases rightofway agreements or permits on satisfactory terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain of our facilities are located on native american tribal lands and are subject to various federal and tribal approvals and regulations which may increase our costs and delay or prevent our efforts to conduct planned operations 

various federal agencies within the us department of the interior particularly the bureau of indian affairs bureau of land management and the office of natural resources revenue along with each native american tribe regulate natural gas and oil operations on native american tribal lands including drilling and production requirements and environmental standards in addition each native american tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal state and local statutes and regulations these tribal laws and regulations include various taxes fees requirements to employ native american tribal members and other conditions that apply to operators and contractors 

conducting operations on native american tribal lands persons conducting operations on tribal lands are generally subject to the native american tribal court system in addition if our relationships with any of the relevant native american tribes were to deteriorate we could face significant risks to our ability to continue operations on native american tribal lands one or more of these factors may increase our cost of doing business on native american tribal lands and impact the viability of or prevent or delay our ability to conduct operations on such lands 

risks relating to strategic transactions 

our proposed spinoff of speedway may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

on october 31 2019 we announced our intention to separate speedway into an independent publicly traded company by the end of 2020 this transaction is subject to certain conditions including final approval by our board of directors receipt of customary assurances regarding the intended taxfree nature of the transaction and the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement with the sec unanticipated developments including possible delays in obtaining various regulatory approvals or clearances uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes could delay or prevent the proposed spinoff or cause the proposed spinoff to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable or different than expected even if the spinoff is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spinoff expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed spinoff may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate executing the proposed spinoff also requires significant time and attention from management which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business following the proposed spinoff the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spinoff not occurred if the proposed speedway spinoff is completed our diversification of revenue sources will diminish due to the separation of the speedway business and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be subject to increased volatility as a result 

if the proposed spinoff of speedway were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes mpc and mpc shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

the speedway spinoff is subject to the receipt of customary assurances regarding the intended taxfree nature of the transactions for us federal income tax purposes notwithstanding receipt of an internal revenue service “irs” private letter ruling andor the opinions of tax advisors the irs could determine that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling or the opinions of tax advisors were based are inaccurate or have not been complied with in addition an irs private letter ruling would not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinions of tax advisors represent the judgment of such tax advisors and are not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinions of tax advisors accordingly notwithstanding receipt by mpc of an irs private letter ruling andor the opinions of tax advisors there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge speedway as well as mpc and mpc shareholders could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the “code” in general for us federal income tax purposes mpc would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the speedway common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and mpc shareholders who receive speedway common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares even if the distribution were to otherwise qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code it may result in taxable gain to mpc but not its shareholders under section 355e of the code if the distribution were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 percent or greater interest by vote or value in mpc or speedway for this purpose any acquisitions of mpc or speedway 

shares within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although mpc or speedway may be able to rebut that presumption including by qualifying for one or more safe harbors under applicable treasury regulations if the irs were to determine that acquisitions of mpc or speedway stock either before or after the distribution were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution such determination could result in significant tax liabilities to mpc 

our ongoing review of other strategic alternatives for our midstream business may pose additional risks to our business 

our board of directors has formed a special committee to evaluate strategies to enhance shareholder value through a review of our midstream business which we primarily conduct through mplx our exploration of strategic alternatives including any uncertainty created by this process involves a number of risks significant fluctuations in our stock price could occur in response to developments relating to the strategic review process or market speculation regarding any such developments we may encounter difficulties in hiring retaining and motivating key personnel during this process or as a result of uncertainties generated by this process or any developments or actions relating to it we may incur substantial increases in general and administrative expense associated with increased legal fees and the need to retain and compensate thirdparty advisors and we may experience difficulties in preserving the commercially sensitive information that may need to be disclosed to third parties during this process or in connection with an assessment of our strategic alternatives the strategic review process also requires significant time and attention from management which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business there can be no assurance that this process will result in the pursuit or consummation of any strategic transaction the occurrence of any one or more of the above risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant acquisitions if any in the future will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows 

any significant future transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks which may include among others 



risks relating to the andeavor acquisition 

the andeavor acquisition may not be accretive and may be dilutive to mpc’s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share which may negatively affect the market price of shares of mpc common stock 

the andeavor acquisition may not be accretive and may be dilutive to mpc’s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share in the future are based on preliminary estimates that may materially change in addition future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected 

any dilution of or decrease or delay of any accretion to mpc’s earnings per share or cash flow from operations per share could cause the price of mpc’s common stock to decline 

mpc has incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the andeavor acquisition which may be in excess of those anticipated by mpc 

mpc has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the andeavor acquisition mpc expects to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies these fees and costs have been and may continue to be substantial 

additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may not be sufficient to allow mpc to offset integrationrelated costs over time these integration costs as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses could materially and adversely affect mpc’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

mpc’s results may suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the andeavor acquisition 

mpc’s success depends in part on its ability to manage its expansion following the andeavor acquisition which poses numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate the operations and business of andeavor into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers vendors and business partners 

mpc may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the andeavor acquisition 

the success of the andeavor acquisition depends in part on mpc’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining mpc’s and andeavor’s businesses including the annual gross runrate commercial and corporate synergies that mpc expects to realize within the first three years after the combination the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the andeavor acquisition may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected may require more nonrecurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the andeavor acquisition that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence 

we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become further impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

we accounted for the andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded to our balance sheet at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill 

as of december 31 2019  our balance sheet reflected 200 billion and 30 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets respectively these amounts include goodwill and other intangible assets of 173 billion and 28 billion  respectively recognized in connection with the andeavor acquisition as a part of our annual impairment review for goodwill mplx recorded approximately 12 billion of impairment expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes further impaired we may be required to incur additional material noncash charges relating to such impairment our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment 

risks relating to our industry 

meeting the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations which may reduce our refining and marketing margin laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following 

 the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources production processes and subsequent judicial interpretation of such laws and regulations as a result of these laws and regulations we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations such expenditures could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for additional information on environmental laws and regulations that may affect us see item 1 business  environmental matters above 

federal state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could delay or impede producer’s gas production or result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather process and fractionate while we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations we do provide gathering processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result of such operations if federal state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such legal requirements could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase producers’ costs of compliance 

climate change and greenhouse gas emission regulation could affect our operations energy consumption patterns and regulatory obligations any of which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

currently multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas including carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides and other emissions are in various phases of consideration promulgation or implementation these include actions to develop international federal regional or statewide programs which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments 

for example in 2017 the california state legislature adopted ab 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in sb 32 compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a marketbased credit system additionally the carb is now exploring the potential for additional greenhouse gas reductions by 2045 via a yet undefined carbon neutrality standard other states are proposing or have already promulgated low 

carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector if we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy increasing concerns about climate change and carbon intensity have also resulted in societal concerns and a number of international and national measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions additional stricter measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition 

international climate changerelated efforts such as the 2015 united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations though the united states has announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement us climate change strategy and implementation of that strategy through legislation and regulation may change under future administrations therefore the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time 

we could also face increased climate‐related litigation with respect to our operations or products governmental and other entities in california new york maryland and rhode island have filed lawsuits against coal gas oil and petroleum companies including the company the lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits as well as their potential effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

regulatory and other requirements concerning the transportation of crude oil and other commodities by rail may cause increases in transportation costs or limit the amount of crude oil that we can transport by rail 

we rely on a variety of systems to transport crude oil including rail rail transportation is regulated by federal state and local authorities new regulations or changes in existing regulations could result in increased compliance expenditures for example in 2015 the us department of transportation issued new standards and regulations applicable to crudebyrail transportation enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for highhazard flammable trains these or other regulations that require the reduction of volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail change the design or standards for rail cars used to transport the crude oil we purchase change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil or require any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering north american crude oil by rail could increase the time required to move crude oil from production areas to our refineries increase the cost of rail transportation and decrease the efficiency of shipments of crude oil by rail within our operations any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

severe weather events and other climate conditions may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations 

we have mature systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks such as floods hurricaneforce winds wildfires and snowstorms and potential chronic physical risks such as higher ocean levels if any such events were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations specifically where appropriate we are hardening and modernizing assets against weather damage and ensuring we have resiliency measures in place such as stormspecific readiness plans we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to protect our assets and operations from such physical risks and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks to the extent such severe weather events or other climate conditions increase in frequency and severity we may be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies 

our anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets however policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups one of the ways we may grow our business is through the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing ones the construction of a new pipeline or the expansion of an existing pipeline by adding horsepower or pump stations or by adding additional pipelines along existing pipelines involves numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties most of which are beyond our control the approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry and concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions downstream of pipeline operations in addition government disruptions such as a us federal government shutdown may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business our expansion or construction projects may not be completed on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost in addition our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project for instance if we build a new pipeline the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing margins 

the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies production companies and trading companies including suppliers from canada the middle east and various other international locations the market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market we are therefore subject to the attendant political geographic and economic risks of such a market if one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our operations sales of refined products and refining and marketing margins could be adversely affected materially and adversely impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from our nonus operations and generally to worldwide political and economic developments 

we operate and sell some of our products in nonus jurisdictions particularly in mexico south america and asia our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets including economic instability restrictions on the transfer of funds duties and tariffs transportation delays difficulty in enforcing contractual provisions import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest security issues involving key personnel and changing regulatory and political environments global outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the coronavirus first detected in wuhan china could affect demand for refined products and economic conditions generally in addition if trade relationships deteriorate with these countries if existing trade agreements are modified or terminated new economic sanctions relevant to such jurisdictions are passed or if taxes border adjustments or tariffs make trading with these countries more costly it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are required to comply with us and international laws and regulations including those involving antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering for example the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage our compliance policies and programs mandate compliance with all applicable anticorruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

more broadly political and economic factors in global markets could impact crude oil and other feedstock supplies and could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products ngls and natural gas additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability for example the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products ngls natural gas or the conduct of business in or with certain foreign countries in addition foreign countries could restrict imports investments or commercial transactions 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use payroll franchise withholding and property taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties 

terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

the us government has issued warnings that energy assets in general including the nation’s refining pipeline and terminal infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations the threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks any future terrorist attacks on our facilities those of our customers and in some cases those of other pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 

 we believe certain of these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock

recent developments 

strategic actions to enhance shareholder value 

on october 31 2019 we announced our intention to separate our retail transportation fuel and convenience store business which is operated primarily under the speedway brand into an independent publicly traded company through a taxfree distribution to mpc shareholders of publicly traded stock in the new independent retail transportation fuel and convenience store company this transaction is targeted to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 subject to market regulatory and certain other conditions including final approval by mpc’s board of directors receipt of customary assurances regarding the intended taxfree nature of the transaction and the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the sec the speedway business is currently a reporting unit within our retail segment mpc will retain its direct dealer business which is also included in the retail segment as currently reported 

mpc’s board of directors also formed a special committee to evaluate strategies to enhance shareholder value through a review of the midstream business and to analyze among other things the strategic fit of assets with mpc the ability to realize full valuation credit for midstream earnings and cash flow balance sheet impacts including liquidity and credit ratings transaction tax impacts separation costs and overall complexity 

mplx acquisition of andx 

on july 30 2019 mplx completed its acquisition of andx and andx survived as a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx at the effective time of the merger each common unit held by andx’s public unitholders was converted into the right to receive 1135 mplx common units andx common units held by certain affiliates of mpc were converted into the right to receive 10328 mplx common units additionally 600000 andx preferred units were converted into 600000 preferred units of mplx the “series b preferred units” series b preferred unitholders are entitled to receive when and if declared by the mplx board a fixed distribution of 6875 per unit per annum payable semiannually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 or the first business day thereafter up to and including february 15 2023 after february 15 2023 the holders of series b preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly distributions payable in arrears on the 15th day of february may august and november of each year or the first business day thereafter based on a floating annual rate equal to the three month libor plus 4652 percent 

the transaction simplified our two sponsored mlps mplx and andx into a single listed entity to create a leading largescale diversified midstream company anchored by feebased cash flows the combined entity has an expanded geographic footprint that is expected to enhance its longterm growth opportunities and the sustainable cash flow profile of the business 

as described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 5 and 6  we have consolidated andx since october 1 2018 in accordance with asc topic 810 consolidation “asc 810” and previously recorded andx’s assets and liabilities to our balance sheet at preliminary fair values as of the andeavor acquisition date of october 1 2018 

executive summary 

results

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining  marketing margin refining operating costs refining planned turnaround and refinery throughputs our total refining capacity was 3067 mbpcd 3021 mbpcd and 1881 mbpcd as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the increase in 2018 was primarily due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 which added 10 refineries with approximately 1117 mbpcd of total refining capacity 

our refining  marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with 

other industry participants we calculate gulf coast midcontinent and west coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products the following will be used for these crackspread calculations 

 our refineries process a variety of sweet and sour grades of crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to the crude oils referenced in our gulf coast midcontinent and west coast crack spreads the amount of these discounts which we refer to as the sweet differential and the sour differential can vary significantly causing our refining  marketing margin to differ from blended crack spreads in general larger sweet and sour differentials will enhance our refining  marketing margin 

future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors as well as us energy policy 

the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions 



 in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sour differential and the sweet differential our refining  marketing margin is impacted by factors such as 

 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market costs of crude oil refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values at december 31 2019  market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

refining  marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refining operating costs and refining planned turnaround costs changes in operating costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs refining planned turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at 

each refinery the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years and only reflects the activity for the acquired refineries after october 1 2018 



we have various longterm feebased commercial agreements with mplx under these agreements mplx which is reported in our midstream segment provides transportation storage distribution and marketing services to our refining  marketing segment certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil refined products and other products certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets

our retail fuel margin for gasoline and distillate which is the price paid by consumers or direct dealers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees where applicable impacts the retail segment profitability gasoline and distillate prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply and demand in the regions where we operate numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year including local competition seasonal demand fluctuations the available wholesale supply the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions as fleet fuel efficiency gains have taken hold gasoline demand fell for the first time since 2012 by 04 percent from 2018 despite average annual gasoline prices falling four percent record level of light trucks’ share of auto sales 72 percent and continuing economic growth in 2019 according to current estimates 2019 gasoline demand fell less than 01 million barrels per day remaining at approximately 93 million barrels per day for the fourth consecutive year meanwhile distillate demand fell for the first time in three years as weather impacted agricultural uses and trade tensions weighed on port traffic in 2019 distillate demand was down 16 percent from 2018 but remained near 41 million barrels per day the fourth highest us demand level ever truck tonnage growth slowed in 2019 rising 34 percent year over year in 2019about half of the prior year’s growth while port container traffic at the 10 largest us ports was flat year over year in 2019 through november 

the margin on merchandise sold at our convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to our retail segment margin approximately 40 percent of our retail margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2019  this percentage decreased from 2018 due to the addition of longterm fuel supply contracts with direct dealers and fuel only locations as part of the andeavor acquisition our retail convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items 

inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value costs of refined products and merchandise are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values as of december 31 2019  market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

midstream 

our midstream segment transports stores distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for our refining  marketing segment the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines the profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges the profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals the profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products the profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the 

refined product throughput at our terminals serve our refining  marketing segment and our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our refining  marketing segment 

as discussed above in the refining  marketing section mplx which is reported in our midstream segment has various longterm feebased commercial agreements related to services provided to our refining  marketing segment under these agreements mplx has received various commitments of minimum throughput storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines terminals and marine operations key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport store distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services commodity prices are a significant influence on the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers such prices also affect profitability 

results of operations 

the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  these amounts include the results of andeavor from the october 1 2018 acquisition date forward this discussion should be read in conjunction with item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 

consolidated results of operations 



 2019 compared to 2018 

net income attributable to mpc decreased 143 million primarily due to increases in net interest and other financial costs and provision for income taxes partially offset by a decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2019  see segment results for additional information 

total revenues and other income increased 2771 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to 

 

total costs and expenses increased 2771 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to 

 income from operations was flat in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of the changes noted above see segment results for additional information 

net interest and other financial costs increased 244 million mainly due to debt assumed in the acquisition of andeavor and increased mplx borrowings partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement losses of 44 million we capitalized interest of 158 million in 2019 and 80 million in 2018  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19 for further details 

provision for income taxes increased 112 million primarily due to nondeductible goodwill impairments partially offset by decreased income before taxes of 239 million  the effective tax rate of 25 percent in 2019 is higher than the us statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests the effective tax rate of 21 percent in 2018 is consistent with the us statutory rate of 21 percent as permanent benefit differences related to income attributable to noncontrolling interest were offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12 for further details 

noncontrolling interests decreased 214 million primarily due lower mplx net income primarily as a result of the 12 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2019 

2018 compared to 2017 

net income attributable to mpc decreased 652 million  increased income from operations was more than offset by a tax benefit of 15 billion resulting from the tcja in 2017 and increased income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2018  see segment results for additional information 

total revenues and other income increased 2173 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to 

 total costs and expenses increased 2018 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to 



taxes continue to be presented on a gross basis and are included in cost of revenues see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 for additional information 

 net interest and other financial costs increased 329 million mainly due to increased mplx borrowings and debt assumed in the acquisition of andeavor in addition mplx recognized 60 million of debt extinguishment costs in 2018 in connection with the redemption of its 750 million of senior notes due 2023 we capitalized interest of 80 million in 2018 and 63 million in 2017  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19 for further details 

provision for income taxes increased 142 billion primarily due to the absence of a tax benefit of 15 billion in 2017 resulting from the tcja and an increase in our income before income taxes which increased 122 billion  the effective tax rate of 21 percent in 2018 is consistent with the us statutory rate of 21 percent as permanent benefit differences related to income attributable to noncontrolling interest were offset by state and local tax expense in 2017  our effective tax rate was impacted by 45 percentage points as a result of the tcja which decreased our effective tax rate from 31 percent to 14 percent the effective tax rate excluding the tcja of 31 percent in 2017 was slightly less than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences including differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12 for further details 

noncontrolling interests increased 454 million due to higher mplx net income resulting primarily from the february 1 2018 dropdown transaction partially offset by the reduced ownership in mplx held by noncontrolling interests following the general partnerincentive distribution rights exchange noncontrolling ownership in mplx decreased to 364 percent at december 31 2018 from 696 percent at december 31 2017  in addition 2018 reflects 68 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in andx of 364 percent for the period from october 1 2018 through the end of the year 

segment results 

our segment income from operations was approximately 754 billion  626 billion and 439 billion for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the following shows the percentage of segment income from operations by segment for the last three years 

refining  marketing 

the following includes key financial and operating data for 2019  2018 and 2017  our results include the results of andeavor from the october 1 2018 acquisition date forward 

we revised our refining  marketing segment supplemental reporting in the second quarter of 2019 as shown in the table on the following page costs formerly included in refining  marketing’s direct operating costs category are now presented in three categories refining operating costs refining planned turnaround costs and depreciation and amortization we also present distribution costs formerly referred to as other operating expenses which are primarily related to transportation and marketing of refined products including fees paid to mplx 

 

 



 

the following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment following the acquisition of andeavor in october 2018 we expanded the benchmark prices included in these tables to include market information for the west coast region of the united states including la carbob and la carb diesel spot prices ans crude prices and a west coast ans 321 crack spread the results of the andeavor businesses are only included in our results from october 1 2018 forward the benchmark crack spreads below do not reflect the market cost of rins necessary to meet epa renewable volume obligations for attributable products under the renewable fuel standard 



 2019 compared to 2018 

refining  marketing segment revenues increased 2414 billion primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes which increased 1032 mbpd largely due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 partially offset by decreased average refined product sales prices of 010 per gallon 

refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 96 percent during 2019 and total refinery throughputs increased 838 mbpd primarily due to the refineries acquired from andeavor 

refining  marketing segment income from operations decreased 114 million primarily driven by higher operating distribution and depreciation and amortization costs in addition to a slight decrease in refining  marketing margin on a per barrel basis the increases in costs and expenses were primarily due to increased sales and production volumes following the andeavor acquisition 

refining  marketing margin was 1423 per barrel for 2019 compared to 1425 per barrel for 2018  refining  marketing margin is affected by our performance against the market indicators shown earlier which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput we estimate a net positive impact of 446 billion on refining  marketing margin primarily due to an approximate 535 billion benefit from increased throughput volume mainly attributed to the andeavor acquisition partially offset by narrower sour and sweet crude oil differentials our 

reported refining  marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices rin prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances for 2019 the refining  marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of 93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018 these factors had an estimated net negative impact on refining  marketing segment income from operations of 33 million in 2019 compared to 2018 resulting in a capture rate of 92 percent in 2019 compared to 91 percent in 2018 

the cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the lifo method there were no material liquidations of lifo inventories in 2019 and 2018  

refining operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization increased 067 per barrel and distribution costs excluding depreciation and amortization increased 028 per barrel primarily due to the inclusion of costs for the refining operations acquired from andeavor the per barrel increases among other items reflect the addition of andeavor’s west coast refineries which generally have higher operating costs than other regions in which we operate due to specific geographical location and regulatory factors distribution costs excluding depreciation and amortization include fees paid to mplx of 322 billion and 228 billion for 2019 and 2018  respectively refining planned turnaround costs decreased 015 per barrel due to the timing of turnaround activity depreciation and amortization per barrel increased by 006  primarily due to the fair value of assets acquired from andeavor as of october 1 2018 during 2019  we recorded a 001 per barrel adjustment to reduce depreciation and amortization which reflects the cumulative effects related to a measurement period adjustment arising from the finalization of purchase accounting 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 356 million in 2019 and 316 million in 2018 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in our rin obligations resulting from the acquisition of andeavor partially offset by lower weighted average rin costs 

2018 compared to 2017 

refining  marketing segment revenues increased 1791 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher refined product sales prices and volumes which increased 402 mbpd and higher refined product sales prices which increased 034 per gallon the increase in sales volumes is largely due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 these increases were partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under asc 606 prospectively from january 1 2018 which resulted in a decrease in refining  marketing segment revenues of 458 billion in 2019 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 for additional information 

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 160 million primarily due to higher throughputs as a result of the andeavor acquisition as well as wider sour and sweet crude differentials for comparison purposes as noted in the market indicators table 2017 indicators have been included which reflect the new indicators we began using subsequent to the acquisition of andeavor based on this the usgc midcontinent and west coast blended 321 crack spread was 1062 in 2018 compared to 1022 in 2017  these crack spreads are net of rin crack adjustments of 161 and 357 for 2018 and 2017  respectively 

based on changes in the market indicators shown above and our refinery throughputs we estimate a positive impact of 340 billion for 2018 compared to 2017 on refining  marketing segment income from operations of which 181 billion and 159 billion are due to the effects of changes in price and volume respectively the market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales differences in our results compared to these market indicators including product price realizations the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of lcm inventory valuation adjustments the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances had an estimated negative impact on refining  marketing segment income from operations of 698 million in 2018 compared to 2017 resulting in a capture rate of 91 percent in 2018 compared to 93 percent in 2017 the significant elements of the negative impact were unfavorable crude acquisition costs and unfavorable product price realizations relative to the market indicators 

the cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the lifo method there were no material liquidations of lifo inventories in 2018 and 2017  

refining operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization decreased 009 per barrel and depreciation and amortization decreased by 011 per barrel primarily due to higher refinery throughput resulting from the addition of the refineries acquired from andeavor in addition these costs decreased due to the dropdown of refining logistics and fuels distribution assets to mplx on february 1 2018 distribution costs excluding depreciation and amortization increased 185 per barrel mainly due to fees paid to mplx of 228 billion in 2018 for services provided related to the dropdown of refining logistics and fuels distribution assets the per barrel increase among other items also reflects the addition of andeavor’s west coast refineries which generally have higher operating costs than other regions in which we operate due to specific geographical location and regulatory factors refining planned turnaround costs increased 009 per barrel due to costs related to the additional refineries acquired from andeavor as well as higher turnaround costs at our detroit and canton refineries partially offset by lower turnaround costs at our galveston bay and garyville refineries 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 316 million in 2018 and 457 million in 2017 the decrease in 2018 was primarily due to lower weighted average rin costs which more than offset the increase in our rin obligations resulting from the acquisition of andeavor

retail 

 





2019 compared to 2018 

retail segment revenues increased 952 billion primarily due to increased fuel and merchandise sales resulting from the andeavor acquisition on october 1 2018 total fuel sales increased 328 billion gallons primarily due to an increase in speedway fuel sales volumes of 137 billion gallons and the addition of direct dealer fuel sales of 191 billion gallons partially offset by a decrease in average gasoline and distillate selling prices of 007 per gallon merchandise sales increased 107 billion  

retail segment income from operations increased 554 million primarily due to higher light product and merchandise margins largely related to the addition of the andeavor retail operations these increases were partially offset by increases in operating expenses and depreciation primarily resulting from the locations acquired from andeavor 

2018 compared to 2017 

retail segment revenues increased 452 billion the majority of this increase is due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 which added companyowned and operated retail locations which are included in speedway fuel sales and direct dealer locations the existing retail business also saw a 118 billion increase in fuel and merchandise sales total fuel sales increased 521 billion primarily due to an increase in speedway fuel sales volumes of 494 million gallons the addition of direct dealer fuel sales of 644 million gallons and an increase in average gasoline and distillate selling prices of 037 per gallon merchandise sales increased 339 million the increases in speedway fuel sales and merchandise sales as well as the addition of sales to direct dealers were primarily due to the acquisition of andeavor these increases were partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under asc 606 prospectively from january 1 2018 which resulted in a decrease in retail segment revenues of 844 million in 2018 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 for additional information 

retail segment income from operations increased 299 million primarily due to contributions from the retail operations acquired in the andeavor acquisition for locations owned prior to the andeavor acquisition increased gasoline and distillate and merchandise margins were more than offset by increased operating expenses 

midstream 

 

 



 2019 compared to 2018 

midstream segment revenue increased 210 billion primarily due to the inclusion of andx revenues subsequent to the andeavor acquisition on october 1 2018 on july 30 2019 mplx acquired andx in addition 2019 reflects an extra month of fees charged for fuels distribution and refining logistics services provided to our refining  marketing segment following the february 1 2018 dropdown to mplx mplx revenues from refining logistics and fuels distribution services provided to mpc were 148 billion and 136 billion for the years ended december 31 2019  and 2018  respectively 

in 2019  midstream segment income from operations increased 842 million largely due to contributions from andx in addition to growth across mplx’s businesses 

2018 compared to 2017 

on february 1 2018 we completed the dropdown of our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to mplx which is reported in our midstream segment refining logistics contains the integrated tank farm assets that support mpc’s refining operations fuels distribution is structured to provide a broad range of scheduling and marketing services as mpc’s agent these new businesses were reported in the midstream segment prospectively from february 1 2018 no effect was given to prior periods as these entities were not considered businesses prior to february 1 2018 

midstream segment revenue and income from operations increased 290 billion and 141 billion respectively revenue increased 194 billion primarily due to fees charged for fuels distribution and refining logistics services following the february 1 2018 dropdown to mplx in addition to services provided by andx following the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 revenues also increased by approximately 502 million due to asc 606 gross ups see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 for additional information 

in 2018 midstream segment income from operations includes 230 million due to contributions from andx and 874 million from the refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services contributed to mplx on february 1 2018 prior period midstream segment results do not reflect the impact of these new businesses the incremental 309 million increase in midstream segment results in 2018 was driven by record gathered processed and fractionated volumes and record pipeline throughput volumes for mplx 

items not allocated to segments 



 2019 compared to 2018 

corporate and other unallocated expenses increased 303 million in 2019 compared to 2018 largely due to the inclusion of costs and expenses related to andeavor operations

nongaap financial measures 

management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with gaap we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to its most comparable gaap financial measure they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the nongaap financial measures we use are as follows 

refining  marketing margin 

refining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes any lcm inventory market adjustment and other items reflected in the table below 



 retail fuel margin 

retail fuel margin is defined as the price paid by consumers or direct dealers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees where applicable and excluding any lcm inventory market adjustment 

retail merchandise margin 

retail merchandise margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of merchandise 



liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 153 billion at december 31 2019 compared to 169 billion at december 31 2018  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table 



net cash provided by operating activities increased 328 billion in 2019 compared to 2018  primarily due to an increase in operating results excluding impairment expenses and favorable change in working capital of 458 million  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 454 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an unfavorable change in working capital of 228 billion partially offset by an increase in operating results the above changes in working capital exclude changes in shortterm debt 

for 2019  changes in working capital were a net 118 million source of cash primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices and volumes on working capital accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable price and volumes current receivables increased primarily due to increases in crude and refined product receivable volumes and prices inventories increased primarily due to increases in refined product and materials  supplies inventories partially offset by a decrease in crude inventory 

for 2018 changes in working capital were a net 340 million use of cash primarily due to the effect of decreases in energy commodity prices on working capital accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices inventories decreased primarily due to a decrease in crude and refined product inventories current receivables decreased primarily due to lower crude oil receivable prices all of these effects exclude the working capital acquired in connection with the acquisition of andeavor 

for 2017 changes in working capital were a net 194 billion source of cash primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices on working capital accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes and prices current receivables increased primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product receivable prices and volumes and inventories decreased primarily due to lower crude oil inventory volumes 

cash flows used in investing activities decreased 141 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 427 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 



the consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash a reconciliation of additions to property plant and equipment to total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years

derivative instruments 

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk 

capital resources 

mpc excluding mplx 

we control mplx through our ownership of the general partner however the creditors of mplx do not have recourse to mpc’s general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements the assets of mplx can only be used to settle its own obligations and its creditors have no recourse to our assets therefore in the following table we present the liquidity of mpc excluding mplx mplx liquidity is discussed in the following section 

our liquidity excluding mplx totaled 83 billion at december 31 2019 consisting of 



 because of the alternatives available to us including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets including a commercial paper program we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm and longterm funding requirements including capital spending programs the repurchase of shares of our common stock dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies 

commercial paper – we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of 2 billion in commercial paper outstanding with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities at december 31 2019  we had no amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program 

mpc bank revolving credit facilities – on august 28 2018 in connection with the andeavor acquisition mpc entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a 5 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that expires in 2023 the fiveyear credit agreement became effective on october 1 2018 on july 26 2019 mpc entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a new 1 billion 364day revolving credit facility that became effective upon the expiration of mpc’s previously existing 1 billion 364day revolving credit facility in september 2019 the new 364day credit agreement contains substantially the same terms and conditions as our previously existing 364day revolving credit facility and will expire in september 2020 there were no borrowings and approximately 1 million of letters of credit outstanding under these facilities at december 31 2019  

trade receivables facility – our trade receivables facility has a borrowing capacity of 750 million depending on the amount of our eligible domestic trade accounts receivable on july 19 2019 we amended our trade receivables facility to extend the maturity date to july 16 2021 as of december 31 2019 eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of 750 million there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31 2019  availability under our trade receivables facility is primarily a function of refined product selling prices 

the mpc credit agreements and our trade receivables facility contain representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types the financial covenant requires us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization as defined in the mpc credit agreements of no greater than 065 to 100 other covenants restrict us andor certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens 

on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the mpc credit agreements and our trade receivables facility including the financial covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 021 to 100 

our intention is to maintain an investmentgrade credit profile as of february 1 2020 the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt are as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investmentgrade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

none of the mpc credit agreements or our trade receivables facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under such agreements and may limit our flexibility to obtain financing in the future including to refinance existing indebtedness in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investmentgrade levels could under certain circumstances decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements

on september 26 2019 mplx entered into a term loan agreement which provides for a committed term loan facility for up to an aggregate of 1 billion available to be drawn in up to four separate borrowings subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions borrowings under the term loan agreement bear interest at mplx’s election at either the adjusted libo rate as defined in the term loan agreement plus a margin or the alternate base rate as defined in the term loan agreement plus a margin  the applicable margins to the benchmark interest rates fluctuate from timetotime based on our credit ratings the proceeds from borrowings under the term loan agreement were used to fund the repayment of mplx’s existing indebtedness and for general business purposes amounts borrowed under the term loan agreement will be due and payable on september 26 2021 

on september 9 2019 mplx issued 2 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes in a public offering consisting of 1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due september 2021 and 1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due september 2022 the proceeds were used to repay various outstanding mplx borrowings and for general business purposes the interest rate applicable to the floating rate senior notes due september 2021 is libor plus 09 percent per annum while the interest rate applicable to the 

floating rate senior notes due september 2022 is libor plus 11 percent per annum interest is payable in march june september and december commencing on december 9 2019 both series of floating rate notes are callable in whole or in part at par plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after september 10 2020 

in connection with mplx’s acquisition of andx on july 30 2019 mplx assumed andx’s outstanding senior notes which had an aggregate principal amount of 375 billion  with interest rates ranging from 3500 percent to 6375 percent and maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2047 on september 23 2019 approximately 306 billion aggregate principal amount of andx’s outstanding senior notes were exchanged for new unsecured senior notes issued by mplx having the same maturity and interest rates as the andx senior notes in an exchange offer and consent solicitation undertaken by mplx leaving approximately 690 million aggregate principal of outstanding senior notes issued by andx of this 500 million was related to the 5500 percent unsecured senior notes due 2019 the principal amount of 500 million and accrued interest of 14 million was paid on october 15 2019 which included interest through the payoff date 

mplx credit agreement – upon the completion of mplx’s acquisition of andx on july 30 2019 the mplx bank revolving credit facility was amended and restated to increase the borrowing capacity to 35 billion and to extend the maturity date to july 30 2024 the andx revolving and dropdown credit facilities were terminated and all outstanding balances were repaid and funded with borrowings under the amended and restated mplx 35 billion bank revolving credit facility there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility at december 31 2019  

the mplx credit agreement and term loan agreement contain certain representations and warranties affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type the financial covenant requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the mplx credit agreement for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 50 to 10 or 55 to 10 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period other covenants restrict mplx andor certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2019  mplx was in compliance with the covenants including the financial covenant with a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 39 to 10 

our intention is to maintain an investmentgrade credit profile for mplx as of february 1 2020 the credit ratings on mplx’s senior unsecured debt are as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investmentgrade rating for mplx there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

neither the mplx credit agreement or term loan agreement contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that mplx credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of mplx senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under such agreements in addition a downgrade of mplx senior unsecured debt ratings to below investmentgrade levels may limit mplx’s ability to obtain future financing including to refinance existing indebtedness 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19 for further discussion of mplx’s debt 

capital requirements 

capital spending 

mpc’s capital investment plan for 2020 totals approximately 26 billion for capital projects and investments excluding mplx capitalized interest and acquisitions mpc’s 2020 capital investment plan includes all of the planned capital spending for refining  marketing retail and corporate as well as a portion of the planned capital investments in midstream the remainder of the planned capital spending for midstream reflects the capital investment plan for mplx we continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant the 2020 capital investment plan for mpc and mplx and capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below 



 refining  marketing 

the refining  marketing segment’s forecasted 2020 capital spending and investments is approximately 16 billion  this amount includes approximately 11 billion of growth capital focused on refinery optimization production of higher value products increased capacity to upgrade residual fuel oil and expanded export capacity maintenance capital is expected to be 450 million  

major capital projects completed over the last three years have prepared us to increase our diesel production process light crude oil increase our export capabilities and meet the transportation fuel regulatory mandate tier 3 fuel standards in addition the star investment project to transform our galveston bay refinery into a worldclass refining complex is progressing according to plan and is scheduled to complete in 2022 

retail 

the retail segment’s 2020 capital forecast of approximately 550 million is focused on continued conversion of acquired locations to the speedway brand and systems growth in existing and new markets dealer sites commercial fuelingdiesel expansion food service through store remodels and high quality acquisitions 

major capital projects over the last three years included converting recently acquired locations to the speedway brand and systems building new store locations remodeling and rebuilding existing locations in core markets and building out our network of commercial fueling lane locations to capitalize on diesel demand growth 

midstream 

mplx’s capital investment plan includes 15 billion of organic growth capital and approximately 250 million of maintenance capital this growth plan includes the continued expansion of the mt airy terminal in addition to projects which increase mplx’s longhaul crude oil natural gas and ngl pipeline transportation capabilities many of mplx’s projects also increase its export capabilities which provides for additional flexibility and competitive advantages mplx’s growth plan also includes the addition of approximately 580 mmcfd of processing capacity at three gas processing plants one in the marcellus and two in the southwest and approximately 80 mbpd of fractionation capacity in the marcellus and utica basins 

major capital projects over the last three years included investments for the development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure to support mplx’s producer customers primarily in the marcellus and utica shale regions development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects including a 

buildout of utica shale infrastructure in connection with the cornerstone pipeline a butane cavern in robinson illinois and a tank farm expansion in texas city texas 

the remaining midstream segment’s forecasted 2020 capital spend excluding mplx is approximately 300 million which primarily relates to investments in equity affiliates 

corporate and other 

the 2020 capital forecast includes approximately 200 million to support corporate activities major projects over the last three years included an expansion project for our corporate headquarters and upgrades to information technology systems 

dividends 

on january 27 2020  we announced our board of directors approved a 058 per share dividend payable march 10 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 19 2020  

share repurchases 

since january 1 2012 our board of directors has approved 180 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of 150 billion of our common stock leaving approximately 30 billion available for repurchases as of december 31 2019  under these authorizations we have acquired 327 million shares at an average cost per share of 4605  the table below summarizes our total share repurchases see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 9 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans 



we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market repurchases negotiated block transactions tender offers accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing and amount of future repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time 

other capital requirements 

in 2019  we made contributions totaling 270 million to our funded pension plans for 2020  we have an immaterial amount of required funding but we may also make voluntary contributions to our funded pension plans at our discretion 

we may from time to time repurchase notes in the open market in tender offers in privatelynegotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate 

contractual cash obligations 

the table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31 2019  the contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to mplx under various feebased commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity capital resources and results of operations even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the offbalance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources 

we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees in conjunction with our spinoff from marathon oil we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil these arrangements are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 26  

transactions with related parties 

we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted on terms comparable to those with unaffiliated parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7 for discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected 

we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers for additional information see item 1a risk factors 

our environmental expenditures including nonregulatory expenditures for each of the last three years were 



 we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 11 percent  10 percent and 12 percent of capital expenditures for 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively excluding acquisitions our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 160 million  or 4 percent  of total planned capital expenditures in 2020  actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 

for more information on environmental regulations that impact us or could impact us see item 1 business – environmental matters item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information 

generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

 valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 

 impairment assessments of longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions including 



expected pricing considerations many of which are difficult to forecast management considers these volume forecasts and other factors when developing our forecasted cash flows 

 we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ materially from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a poor outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes a significant reduction in natural gas or ngls processed a significant reduction in refining or retail fuel margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets companyowned convenience store locations for retail segment assets and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value 

unlike longlived assets goodwill is subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing at the reporting unit level a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value without exceeding the recorded amount of goodwill as of december 31 2019  we had a total of 2004 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet which was associated with eight of our ten reporting units 

prior to performing our annual impairment assessment as of november 30 2019 mpc had goodwill totaling approximately 2128 billion associated with nine reporting units as part of this assessment mplx recorded approximately 12 billion of impairment expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to its western gathering  processing “gp” reporting unit which brought the amount of goodwill recorded within this reporting unit to zero the impairment was primarily driven by updated guidance related to the slowing of drilling activity which has reduced production growth forecasts from mplx’s producer customers for the eight remaining reporting units with goodwill we determined that no significant adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary the annual impairment assessment for these eight reporting units resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 8 percent to 457 percent the reporting unit for which fair value exceeded its carrying amount by 8 percent our midstream crude gathering reporting unit had goodwill totaling 11 billion at december 31 2019  the operations which make up this reporting unit were acquired through our acquisition of andeavor and were subsequently acquired by mplx on july 30 2019 through a common control transaction we accounted for the october 1 2018 acquisition of andeavor including acquiring control of andx using the acquisition method of accounting which required andeavor assets and liabilities to be recorded by us at the acquisition date fair value as such given the short amount of time from when fair value was established to the date of the annual impairment test the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value within this reporting unit is not unexpected also our midstream eastern gp reporting unit had fair value exceeding its carrying value of approximately 18 percent a nd had goodwill totaling 18 billion as of december 31 2019  an increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit would not have resulted in goodwill impairment as of november 30 2019 no other mpc reporting units had fair values exceeding carrying values of less than 19 percent 

significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units’ fair value included estimates of future cash flows and market information for comparable assets if estimates for future cash flows which are impacted by producer customers’ development plans which impact future volumes and capital requirements were to decline the overall reporting units’ fair value would decrease resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying 

assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value during the fourth quarter of 2019 two of the joint ventures in which mplx has an interest recorded impairments which impacted the amount of income from equity method investments during the period by approximately 28 million for one of the joint ventures mplx also had a basis difference which was being amortized over the life of the underlying assets as a result of the impairment recorded by the joint venture mplx also assessed this basis difference for impairment and recorded approximately 14 million of impairment during the quarter related to this investment which was recorded through “income from equity method investments” this impairment was largely due to a reduction in forecasted volumes of the joint venture related to the loss of one of its customers at december 31 2019  we had 690 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 14 for additional information on our equity method investments see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 16 for additional information on our goodwill and intangibles including a table summarizing our recorded goodwill by segment 

acquisitions 

in accounting for business combinations acquired assets assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired if any is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain respectively a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property plant and equipment intangible assets contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and for certain acquisitions engage thirdparty consultants for valuation assistance 

the fair value of assets and liabilities including contingent consideration as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches including the income approach which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate the cost approach which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entityspecific differences the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ materially from the projected results used to determine fair value 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5 for additional information on our acquisitions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17 for additional information on fair value measurements 

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

variable interest entities 

we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests variable interests can be contractual ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie’s assets when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly 

impact the vie’s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated 

significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie we evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest andor if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group we continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions 

changes in the design or nature of the activities of a vie or our involvement with a vie may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity’s status as a vie andor our status as the primary beneficiary such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization this could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary which would have a significant impact on our financial statements 

variable interest entities are discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6  

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 

 we utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for each of our pension plans and retiree health and welfare based on the projected benefit payment patterns of each individual plan the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuaries’ discount rate models these models calculate an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using yield curves derived from aa or higher bond yields the yield curves represent a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 320 percent for our pension plans and 325 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 90 million and 37 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 12 million and 3 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 42 percent equity securities and 58 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness we used the 615 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2019 defined benefit pension expense after evaluating activity in the capital markets along with the current and projected plan investments we decreased the asset rate of return for our primary plan to 600 percent effective for 2020 decreasing the 600 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 5 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

we utilized the 2019 mortality tables from the us society of actuaries 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 23 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

as discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2019  we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 17 and 18 for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

refining  marketing 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below lifo inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts but we also enter into overthecounter swaps options and overthecounter options we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

midstream 

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond mplx’s control a portion of mplx’s profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at its own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by mplx’s producer customers such prices also indirectly affect profitability mplx has a committee comprised of senior management that oversees risk management activities continually monitors the risk management program and adjusts its strategy as conditions warrant derivative contracts utilized for crude oil natural gas and ngls are swaps and options traded on the otc market and fixed price forward contracts 

mplx would be exposed to additional commodity risk in certain situations such as if producers under‑deliver or over‑deliver products or if processing facilities are operated in different recovery modes in the event that mplx has derivative positions in excess of the product delivered or expected to be delivered the excess derivative positions may be terminated 

mplx management conducts a standard credit review on counterparties to derivative contracts and it has provided the counterparties with a guaranty as credit support for its obligations a separate agreement with certain counterparties allows markwest liberty midstream to enter into derivative positions without posting cash collateral mplx uses standardized agreements that allow for offset of certain positive and negative exposures in the event of default or other terminating events including bankruptcy 

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the following table includes the composition of net lossesgains on our commodity derivative positions for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 18 for additional information on our open derivative positions at december 31 2019  

sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2019 is provided in the following table 



we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2019 would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

our use of fixed or variablerate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk fixed rate debt such as our senior notes exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates or that our current fixed rate debt may be higher than the current market variablerate debt such as borrowings under our revolving credit facilities exposes us to shortterm changes in market rates that impact our interest expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19 for additional information on our debt 

sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint change in interest rates on longterm debt including the portion classified as current and excluding finance leases as of december 31 2019 is provided in the following table fair value of cash and cash equivalents receivables accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the shortterm maturity of the instruments accordingly these instruments are excluded from the table 



 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17 for additional information on the fair value of our debt 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2019

 item 1 business 

overview 

marathon petroleum corporation “mpc” has 131  years of experience in the energy business with roots tracing back to the formation of the ohio oil company in 1887 we are a leading integrated downstream energy company headquartered in findlay ohio with the acquisition of andeavor october 1 2018 as described further below we are the largest independent petroleum product refining marketing retail and midstream business in the united states we operate the nations largest refining system with more than 3 million barrels per day of crude oil capacity across 16 refineries mpcs marketing system includes branded locations across the united states we also own and operate retail convenience stores across the united states mpc’s midstream operations are primarily conducted through mplx lp “mplx” and andeavor logistics lp “andx” which own and operate crude oil and light product transportation and logistics infrastructure as well as gathering processing and fractionation assets we own the general partner and majority limited partner interests in these two midstream companies 

our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing retail  and midstream  each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers 

 andeavor acquisition 

on october 1 2018 we completed the andeavor acquisition under the terms of the merger agreement andeavor stockholders had the option to choose 187  shares of mpc common stock or 15227  in cash per share of andeavor common stock the merger agreement included election proration provisions that resulted in approximately 229 million  shares of andeavor common stock being converted into cash consideration and the remaining 1282 million  shares of andeavor common stock being converted into stock consideration andeavor stockholders received in the aggregate approximately 2398 million  shares of mpc common stock valued at 198 billion  and approximately 35 billion  in cash in connection with the andeavor acquisition through the andeavor acquisition we acquired the general partner and 156 million common units of andx which is a publicly traded master limited partnership “mlp” that was formed to own operate develop and acquire logistics assets 

andeavor was a highly integrated marketing logistics and refining company operating primarily in the western and midcontinent united states andeavor’s operations included procuring crude oil from its source or from other third parties transporting the crude oil to one of its 10 refineries and producing marketing and distributing refined products its marketing system included more than 3300 stations marketed under multiple wellknown fuel brands including arco ®  also as noted above we acquired the general partner and 156 million common units of andx a leading growthoriented full service and diversified midstream company which owns and operates networks of crude oil refined products and natural gas pipelines terminals with crude oil and refined products storage capacity rail loading and offloading facilities marine terminals including storage bulk petroleum distribution facilities a trucking fleet and natural gas processing and fractionation complexes 

this transaction combined two strong complementary companies to create a leading nationwide us downstream energy company the acquisition substantially increases our geographic diversification and scale and strengthens each of our operating segments by diversifying our refining portfolio into attractive markets and increasing access to advantaged feedstocks enhancing our midstream footprint in the permian basin and creating a nationwide retail and marketing portfolio all of which is expected to substantially improve efficiencies and our ability to serve customers we expect the combination to generate up 

to approximately 14 billion in gross runrate synergies within the first three years significantly enhancing our longterm cash flow generation profile 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5  for additional information on other acquisitions and investments in affiliates 

transactions with mplx 

on february 1 2018 we completed the dropdown of the remaining identified assets related to our strategic actions to enhance shareholder value announced in january 2017 we contributed our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to mplx in exchange for 41 billion  in cash and approximately 114 million newly issued mplx common units immediately following the dropdown our idrs were cancelled and our economic general partner interest was converted into a noneconomic general partner interest all in exchange for 275 million newly issued mplx common units mplx financed the cash portion of the february 1 2018 dropdown with its 41 billion   364 day term loan facility which was entered into on january 2 2018 on february 8 2018 mplx issued 55 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering mplx used 41 billion  of the net proceeds of the offering to repay the 364day termloan facility the remaining proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under mplx’s revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with us and for general partnership purposes 

corporate history and structure 

mpc was incorporated in delaware on november 9 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of marathon oil corporation “marathon oil” on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its refining marketing  transportation business into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil common stock on june 30 2011 our common stock trades on the nyse under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

mplx is a diversified largecap publicly traded mlp formed by us in 2012 that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets and provides fuels distribution services as of december 31 2018  we owned the general partner and 636 percent  of the outstanding mplx common units 

andx is a publicly traded mlp that was formed in 2010 to own operate develop and acquire logistics assets as of december 31 2018  we owned the general partner and 636 percent  of the outstanding andx common units 

our business strategies 

by following our core values we aim to achieve our strategic vision outlined below 

core values and operational excellence 

our core values are the foundation for all we do and include the following 

 maintain toptier safety and environmental performance 

we remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continual improvement in our safety and environmental record across our operations through the use of a rigorous independently audited management system rc14001 ® 2015 this management system integrates health environmental stewardship safety and security to ensure compliance and continual improvement six of our 16 refineries the marathon pipeline organization and the terminal transport and rail organization are already certified to the rc14001 standard we expect our natural gas gathering and processing operations will begin to seek rc14001 certification in 2020 and we have begun the process of integrating our newly acquired operations into the rc14004 management system 

as noted in the graph below our refining operations continue to demonstrate solid personal safety performance as compared to similar industry averages 

safety performance a   

 in addition our corporate headquarters four of our 16 refineries and 14 additional facilities have earned designations as an osha vpp star site this designation recognizes the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have implemented effective safety and health management systems and achieved exemplary occupational safety and health performance three additional sites have completed their osha vpp inspections in 2018 and will be eligible for vpp status in 2019 

we proactively address our regulatory requirements and encourage our operations to continually improve their environmental performance through our dei program which establishes goals and measures performance dei is a metric adopted by mpc to capture several categories simultaneously it includes three categories of environmental incidents releases to the environment air land or water environmental permit exceedances and agency enforcement actions we rank deis in terms of their severity with tier 4 being the most severe and tier 1 being the least we report and track these as a leading indicator that helps us to identify potential problems before they occur we continually strive for improvements in our environmental performance in 2018  we experienced 23 deis a 62 percent reduction from 2013 and we have already begun to integrate our recently acquired operations into these programs 

in 2018 the epa recognized marathon petroleum corporation as an energy star partner of the year the only oil and gas company to receive such honor this award recognized the significant energy efficiency gains achieved since we established our “focus on energy” program at our refineries nearly a decade ago through the implementation of this program we have earned 75 percent of the total energy star certifications awarded to the us refining sector since 2006 overall we have realized considerable savings in energy costs and our energy efficiency efforts have enabled us to significantly lower our greenhouse gas intensity 

capture value and leverage integrated business model 

with the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 we believe the enhanced scale and integration of our midstream retail and refining assets distinguishes us from our competitors our nationwide footprint enables connectivity to key supply sources and demand hubs we have additional access to advantaged feedstocks and our expanded logistics system lowers crude acquisition costs increases optionality and increases our speed to market our broader market presence creates new product placement options and our nationwide marketing channels create even further optimization opportunities with operations coast to coast we intend to leverage and optimize the significant scale of our midstream retail and refining assets to recognize up to approximately 14 billion of gross runrate synergies by the end of 2021 further information about our synergy outlook and estimated gross runrate synergies are included below 

 strategically invest in attractive longterm growth opportunities 

we intend to allocate significant portions of our capital to investments focused on enhancing margins system wide with disciplined allocation to projects with superior returns 

our refining  marketing segment projects are focused on refinery optimization production of higher value products increased capacity to upgrade residual fuel oil and expanded export capacity investing to enhance margins we will continue our disciplined highreturn investments in resid upgrading capacity and the ability to produce more diesel we also plan to continue investing in domestic light products supply placement flexibility as well as increasing our export capacity 

in our retail segment projects are focused on high value growth opportunities real estate and store portfolio optimization and technology enhancements our plans include conversion of recently acquired locations to the speedway brand and systems growth in existing and new markets dealer sites commercial fuelingdiesel expansion food service through store remodels and high quality acquisitions 

in our midstream segment projects are focused on meeting market needs in the permian marcellus and utica basins as well as investments in export opportunities and longhaul pipelines we plan to invest in gathering systems to create significant growth opportunities in the permian basin and in longhaul pipelines to generate stable feebased midstream income while helping to lower feedstock costs for our refineries we also plan to expand our value chain by connecting growing natural gas production to demand from our refineries and global export markets and by connecting growing ngl production and developing new fractionation infrastructure in the gulf coast export facilities create the ability to generate third party revenue and meet global demand for crude refined products and ngls 

focus on disciplined capital allocation and shareholder returns 

we intend to maintain our focus on a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation including return of capital to shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile since becoming a standalone company in june 2011 our dividend has increased by a 249 percent compound annual growth rate and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling 180 billion  through open market purchases and two asr programs we have repurchased 293 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 1310 billion  representing approximately 41  percent of our outstanding common shares when we became a standalone company in june 2011 we achieved these shareholder returns while meaningfully investing in the business and maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile as of december 31 2018  490 billion  of authorization remains available for future share repurchases 

utilize and enhance our high quality employee workforce 

we utilize our high quality employee workforce by continuously leveraging their commercial skills and business acumen in addition we continue to enhance our workforce through active recruitment of the best candidates including those from diverse backgrounds and effective training programs on safety environmental stewardship diversity and inclusion and other professional and technical skills 

our operations 

our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing retail and midstream 

refining  marketing 

refineries 

we currently own and operate 16  refineries in the gulf coast midcontinent and west coast regions of the united states with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of 3021 mbpcd on october 1 2018 we acquired 10 refineries as part of the andeavor acquisition which added approximately 1117  mbpcd to our total capacity during 2018  our refineries processed 2081 mbpd of crude oil and 193  mbpd of other charge and blendstocks during 2017  our refineries processed 1765  mbpd of crude oil and 179  mbpd of other charge and blendstocks

the following table sets forth our refined product sales volumes by product group for each of the last three years including sales from the refineries acquired in the andeavor acquisition from october 1 2018 forward 



refined product sales destined for export 

we sell gasoline distillates and asphalt for export primarily out of our garyville galveston bay anacortes martinez los angeles and kenai refineries the following table sets forth our refined product sales destined for export by product group for the past three years including sales from the refineries acquired in the andeavor acquisition from october 1 2018 forward 



gasoline and distillates   we sell gasoline gasoline blendstocks and distillates including no 1 and no 2 fuel oils jet fuel kerosene and diesel fuel to wholesale customers marathonbranded independent entrepreneurs our retail segment and on the spot market in addition we sell diesel fuel and gasoline for export to international customers the demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months 

propane   we produce propane at all of our refineries except dickinson propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles our propane sales are split approximately 60 percent and 40 percent between the home heating market and petrochemical consumers respectively 

feedstocks and petrochemicals   we are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and petrochemicals product availability varies by refinery and includes naptha raffinate benzene butane alkylate dry gas xylene propylene cumene platformate and toluene we market these products domestically to customers in the chemical agricultural and fuelblending industries in addition we produce fuelgrade coke at our garyville detroit galveston bay and los angeles refineries which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications and anodegrade coke at our los angeles and robinson refineries which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry

terminals and transportation 

we transport store and distribute crude oil feedstocks and refined products through pipelines terminals and marine fleets owned by mplx andx and third parties in our market areas 

we own a fleet of transport trucks and trailers for the movement of refined products and crude oil in addition we maintain a fleet of leased and owned railcars for the movement and storage of refined products 

the locations and detailed information about our refining  marketing assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of refined products based upon the “the oil  gas journal 2018 worldwide refinery survey” we ranked first among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity 

we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale spot branded and retail distribution our marketing operations compete with numerous other independent marketers integrated oil companies and highvolume retailers we compete with companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market and refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded independent entrepreneurs in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and retail consumers 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils ans wti and lls crude oils and other market structure differentials also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for our refining  marketing segment for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

retail 

our retail segment sells gasoline diesel and merchandise through convenience stores that it owns and operates primarily under the speedway brand as well as through direct dealer locations our companyowned and operated convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items speedway’s speedy rewards ®  loyalty program has been a highly successful loyalty program since its inception in 2004 with a consistently growing base which averaged approximately 62 million  active members in 2018  speedway’s ability to capture and analyze memberspecific transactional data enables us to offer speedy rewards ®  members discounts and promotions specific to their buying behavior we believe speedy rewards ®  is a key reason customers choose speedway over competitors and it continues to drive significant value for both speedway and our speedy rewards ®  members 

as of december 31 2018  our retail segment had 3923  companyowned and operated convenience stores across the united states we acquired approximately 1100 companyowned and operated retail convenience stores and fuel only locations as part of the andeavor acquisition in the western and midcontinental regions of the united states in addition we acquired longterm supply contracts for 1065  direct dealer locations primarily in southern california largely under the arco ®  brand which are also included in our retail segment 

speedway also owns a 29 percent interest in pfj southeast llc “pfj southeast” which is a joint venture between speedway and pilot flying j with 127 travel center locations primarily in the southeast united states as of december 31 2018  we also own supermom’s ®  a highquality bakery and commissary 

the locations and detailed information about our retail  assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

we face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies independent entrepreneurs and other wellrecognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers often selling gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise at competitive prices nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into sales of retail gasoline and diesel fuel energy analysts international inc estimated such retailers had approximately 16  percent of the us gasoline market in mid 2018  

demand for gasoline and diesel fuel is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic as a result the operating results for our retail segment for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel 

midstream 

the midstream  segment primarily includes the operations of mplx and andx our sponsored master limited partnerships which transport store distribute and market crude oil and refined products principally for the refining  marketing segment via refining logistics assets pipelines terminals towboats and barges gather process and transport natural gas and gather transport fractionate store and market ngls the midstream segment also includes certain related operations retained by mpc

our midstream  operations face competition for natural gas gathering crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services in obtaining unprocessed ngls for gathering and fractionation and in marketing our products and services competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants operating efficiency and reliability and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of capacity proximity to supply and industry marketing centers and cost efficiency and reliability of service competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and ngls is based primarily on price delivery capabilities flexibility and maintenance of highquality customer relationships in addition certain of our midstream  operations are highly regulated which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

our midstream  segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and ngls and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year 

environmental matters 

our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for reviewing our overall environmental performance we also have a corporate emergency response team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review discussion or implementation the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant for additional information see item 1a risk factors we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products additionally we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable 

our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment such laws and regulations include among others the clean air act “caa” with respect to air emissions the clean water act “cwa” with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized

air 

greenhouse gas emissions 

we are subject to many requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations internationally and domestically emphasis has been placed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 the trump administration continued its shift in climaterelated policy away from the obama administration’s policies one of the major policy shifts is related to the administration’s efforts to repeal and replace the “clean power plan” on august 21 2018 the us environmental protection agency “epa” proposed the affordable clean energy “ace” rule which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coalfired power plants the ace rule would replace the 2015 clean power plan which had been stayed by the us supreme court president trump also announced the united states’ intention to withdraw from the 2015 paris un climate change conference agreement which aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees celsius as compared to preindustrial levels many of the policies and regulations rescinded through executive order 13783 had been adopted to meet the united states’ pledge under the agreement the us climate change strategy and implementation of that strategy through legislation and regulation may change under future administrations therefore the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time 

in 2009 the epa issued an “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to the endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles the endangerment finding the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act resulted in permitting of greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources through a series of legal challenges filed against the epa the requirement to control greenhouse gas emissions through best available control technology has been limited to new and modified large stationary sources such as refineries that will also emit a criteria pollutant implementing best available control technology may result in increased costs to our operations 

in the   absence of federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions states are becoming more active in regulating greenhouse gas emissions these measures may include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions these measures may also include lowcarbon fuel standards such as the california program or a state carbon tax these measures could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented for example in california the state legislature adopted sb 32 in 2016 sb 32 set a cap on emissions of 40 below 1990 levels by 2030 but did not establish a particular mechanism to achieve that target the legislature also adopted a companion bill ab 197 that most significantly directs the carb to prioritize direct emission reductions on large stationary sources in 2017 the state legislature adopted ab 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in sb 32 compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a marketbased credit system the compliance costs associated with these california regulations are ultimately passed on to the consumer in the form of higher fuel costs we cannot currently predict the impact of these regulations on our liquidity financial position or results of operations but we do not believe such impact will be material 

we could also face increased climaterelated litigation with respect to our operations or products private party litigation seeking damages and injunctive relief is pending against mpc and other oil and gas companies in multiple jurisdictions although uncertain these actions could increase our costs of operations or reduce the demand for the refined products we produce transport store and sell 

private parties have also sued federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken in sum requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments these requirements 

may also significantly affect mpc’s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the extent and magnitude of the impact from greenhouse gas regulation or legislation cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 

regardless of whether legislation or regulation is enacted given the continuing global demand for oil and gas  even under different hypothetical carbonconstrained scenarios  mpc has taken actions that have resulted in lower greenhouse gas emission intensity and we are positioned to remain a successful company well into the future we have instituted a program to improve energy efficiency of our refineries and other assets which will continue to pay dividends in reducing our environmental footprint as well as making us more costcompetitive we believe our mature governance and riskmanagement processes enable the company to effectively monitor and adjust to any transitional reputational or physical climaterelated risks 

clean air act 

in 2015 the epa finalized a revision to the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for ozone the epa lowered the primary ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to 70 ppb this revision initiated a multiyear process in which nonattainment designations will be made based on more recent ozone measurements that includes data from 2016 on november 6 2017 the epa finalized ozone attainmentunclassifiable designations for certain areas under the new standard in actions dated april 30 2018 and july 25 2018 the epa finalized nonattainment designations for certain areas under the lower primary ozone standard in some areas these nonattainment designations could result in increased costs associated with or result in cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities for areas designated nonattainment states will be required to adopt state implementation plans “sips” for nonattainment areas these sips may include nox andor volatile organic compound “voc” reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities we cannot predict the effects of the various sips requirements at this time 

in california the board for the south coast air quality management district “scaqmd” passed amendments to the regional clean air incentives market “reclaim” that became effective in 2016 requiring a staged reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 in 2017 the state of california passed ab 617 which requires each air district that is a nonattainment area for one or more air pollutants to adopt an expedited schedule for implementation of best available retrofit control technology “barct” on specific facilities barct applies to all facilities subject to reclaim in response to ab 617 the scaqmd is currently working to “sunset” the existing reclaim program and replace it with applicable barct regulations 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other things requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances opa90 also requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages and provides for civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we operate tank vessels and facilities from which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements 

additionally opa90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be doublehulled and that existing tank vessels that are not doublehulled be retrofitted or removed from us service all barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the doublehulled requirements of opa90 some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

in june 2015 the epa and the united states army corps of engineers finalized significant changes to the definition of the term “waters of the united states” used in numerous programs under the cwa this final rulemaking is referred to as the clean water rule the clean water rule as written expands permitting planning and reporting obligations and may extend the timing to secure permits for pipeline and fixed asset construction and maintenance activities the clean water rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts by many states trade groups and other interested parties and in october 2015 a united states court of appeals issued a nationwide stay of the clean water rule on appeal however the supreme court determined that the court of appeals did not have original jurisdiction to review challenges to the 2015 rule as such legal challenges to the rule will proceed in federal district courts three federal district courts have stayed the clean water rule in twentyeight states concurrent with the legal challenges on february 28 2017 president trump signed executive order 13778 directing the epa and the army corps of engineers to review the 2015 rule for consistency with the policy outlined in the order and to issue a proposed rule rescinding or revising the 2015 rule as appropriate and consistent with law on december 11 2018 the 

epa and the army corps of engineers announced its proposed new definition of “waters of the united states” the proposal once finalized would replace the 2015 clean water rule 

in 2015 the epa issued its intent to review the cwa categorical effluent limitation guidelines “elg” for the petroleum refining sector during 2017 the epa prepared and issued an information request “icr” requesting significant wastewater and treatment process details from select refineries seven of which were ours responses to the icr were submitted to the epa in early 2018 as of late 2018 the epa is in the process of reviewing the icr response data submitted and determining the next steps for the elg review epa may also perform sampling of effluent at one or more of our refineries the epa has indicated they believe there have been significant changes in the characteristics of waste waters generated within refining operations that warrant the review specific targets for the review are the impacts of processing heavier crude oils and the transfer of air pollutants to wastewater when air pollution abatement devices are in use a similar project initiated in 2007 for steam electric power generation with similar attributes resulted in a significant change in the treatment requirements for coalfired power plants however on september 18 2017 the epa postponed certain compliance dates while it conducts a rulemaking to revise the elgs for power plants the refining sector elg review has the potential to result in a similar impact the typical lifecycle for an elg review from the intent to review to issuance of a final rule that would require upgrades is seven years the impact of an elg review cannot be accurately estimated at this time 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of usts containing regulated substances 

pursuant to an order received in 2004 from the san francisco bay regional water quality control board we are performing remediation of certain waste management units and completing investigations of the design conditions of certain active wastewater and storm water impoundments at our martinez refinery the investigative and remedial costs associated with the 2004 order could have a material impact on our results of operations the costs that are estimable and probable at this time have been accrued 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain convenience stores and other locations where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the applicable state laws and regulations a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

mileage standards renewable fuels and other fuels requirements 

the us congress passed the energy independence and security act of 2007 “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 and contains the rfs2 in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 in 2018 the epa and the nhtsa jointly proposed the safer affordable fuelefficient vehicles rules for model years 20212026 which would propose new corporate average fuel economy “cafe” standards for model years 2022 through 2026 amend the 2021 model year cafe standards amend the epa’s carbon dioxide emission standards for model years 2021 through 2025 and establish new carbon dioxide emission standards for model year 2026 the epa’s preferred alternative is to retain the model year 2020 standards for both programs through model year 2026 the standards established by the final regulation may 

differ additionally california may establish per its clean air act waiver authority different standards that could apply in multiple states higher cafe standards for cars and light trucks have the potential to reduce demand for our transportation fuels new or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations 

the rfs2 requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 260 billion gallons in 2018 280 billion gallons in 2019 and increase to 360 billion gallons by 2022 within the total volume of renewable fuel eisa established an advanced biofuel volume of 110 billion gallons in 2018 130 billion gallons in 2019 and increasing to 210 billion gallons in 2022 subsets within the advanced biofuel volume include biomassbased diesel which was set as at least 10 billion gallons in 2014 through 2022 to be determined by the epa through rulemaking and cellulosic biofuel which was set at 70 billion gallons in 2018 85 billion gallons in 2019 and increasing to 160 billion gallons in 2022 

on november 30 2015 the epa finalized the renewable fuel standards for the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 as well as the biomassbased diesel standard for 2017 in a legal challenge to the 20142016 volumes the court vacated the total renewable volume for 2016 and remanded to the epa for reconsideration consistent with the court’s opinion a remanded rule that increases the 2016 total renewable volume could increase our cost of compliance with the renewable fuel standards and be detrimental to the rin market the 2017 and 2018 rfs volumes have also been challenged in court 

on november 30 2018 the epa finalized rfs volume requirements for the year 2019 and the biomassbased diesel volume requirement for year 2020 the epa used its cellulosic waiver authority to reduce the volumes for 2019 from the statutory amounts to the following 1992 billion gallons total renewable fuel 492 billion gallons advanced biofuel and 418 million gallons cellulosic biofuel the epa set the biomassbased diesel volume requirement for 2020 at 243 billion gallons which is significantly greater than the statutory floor of 10 billion gallons 

the rfs2 is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline vehicle regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline “e10” since 2016 the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the e10 blendwall which will require obligated parties to either sell e15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed historical levels or retire carryover rins 

we have made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the annuallyincreasing biodiesel rfs2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product and by buying needed biodiesel rins in the epacreated biodiesel rins market on april 1 2014 we purchased a facility in cincinnati ohio which currently produces biodiesel glycerin and other byproducts as a producer of biodiesel we generate rins thereby reducing our reliance on the external rin market 

in november 2017 the epa finalized its decision to deny petitions requesting that the point of obligation for the rfs2 be moved to the terminal rack the epa’s final decision was challenged in court and should the court decide that epa’s decision was incorrect and move the point of obligation we could be subject to increased costs and compliance uncertainties 

in addition to federal renewable fuel standards certain states have or are considering promulgation of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards for example california began implementing its low carbon fuel standard “lcfs” in january 2011 in september 2015 the carb approved the readoption of the lcfs which became effective on january 1 2016 to address procedural deficiencies in the way the original regulation was adopted the lcfs was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030 

in sum the rfs2 has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use we may experience a decrease in demand for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced by renewable fuels demand for our refined products also may decrease as a result of low carbon fuel standard programs or electric vehicle mandates 

on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm from 2014 through 2018 we made approximately 490 million in capital expenditures to comply with these standards and expect to make approximately 260 million in capital expenditures for these standards in 2019 

tribal lands 

various federal agencies including the epa and the department of the interior along with certain native american tribes promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on native american tribal lands where we operate these regulations include such matters as lease provisions drilling and production requirements and standards to protect 

environmental quality and cultural resources for example the epa has established a preconstruction permitting program for new and modified minor sources throughout indian country and new and modified major sources in nonattainment areas in indian country in addition each native american tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal state and local statutes and regulations these laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on native american tribal lands and impact the viability of or prevent or delay our ability to conduct our operations on such lands 

trademarks patents and licenses 

o ur marathon trademark is material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations and our speedway and arco trademarks are material to the conduct of our retail operations additionally the retail and marketing businesses we acquired in the andeavor acquisition primarily use the shell ®  and mobil ®  brands for fuel sales and ampm ®  and giant ®  brands for convenience store merchandise we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole in general we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of knowhow rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations 

employees 

we had approximately 60350  regular fulltime and parttime employees as of december 31 2018  which includes approximately 40230  employees of our retail segment 

approximately 4780 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements of these employees approximately 1465 employees at our galveston bay mandan and martinez refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements which were set to expire on january 31 2019 the parties continue their negotiations toward a new agreement and are working under rolling extensions approximately 425 employees at our martinez chemical plant our los angeles refinery and our galveston bay refinery are covered by collective bargaining agreements expiring over the next several months approximately 410 hourly employees at speedway are represented under collective bargaining agreements the majority of these employees work at certain retail locations in new york and new jersey under agreements which expire on march 14 2019 and june 30 2019 respectively the remaining speedway represented employees are drivers in minnesota under an agreement which expires in 2021 approximately 300 employees at our st paul park and gallup refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in 2020 approximately 1620 employees at our anacortes canton catlettsburg los angeles and salt lake city refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire in 2022 the remaining 560 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate while others relate to the ownership of our common stock 

our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business 

a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products historically refining and marketing margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market factors that are beyond our control including 



 some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce which may reduce our revenues income from operations and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures impair the carrying value of our assets such as property plant and equipment inventory or goodwill and decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions such as scheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages severe weather labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as acts of terrorism for example pipelines or railroads provide a nearlyexclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries in such instances a prolonged interruption material reduction or cessation of service of such a pipeline or railway whether due to private party or governmental action or other reason could materially and adversely affect the operations profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations may result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

in addition we operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive waters where tanker pipeline rail car and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups our coastal refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by tanker in addition our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by rail car truck and barge transportation and storage of crude oil other feedstocks and refined products over and adjacent to water involves inherent risk and subjects us to the provisions of the opa90 and state laws in us coastal and great lakes states and states bordering inland waterways on which we operate as well as international laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate if we are unable to promptly and adequately contain any accident or discharge involving tankers pipelines rail cars or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil other feedstocks or refined products we may be subject to substantial liability in addition the service providers we have contracted to aid us in a discharge response may be unavailable due to weather conditions governmental regulations or other local or global events international federal or state rulings could divert our response resources to other global events 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including but not limited to explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases cybersecurity breaches or other incidents involving our assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows marine vessel charter agreements may not provide complete indemnity for oil spills and any marine charterer’s liability insurance we carry may not cover all losses historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

we rely on the performance of our information technology systems and the interruption or failure of any information technology system including an interruption or failure due to a cybersecurity breach could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems including our network infrastructure and cloud applications for the effective operation of our business we rely on such systems to process transmit and store electronic information including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee customer investor and payroll data and to manage or support a variety of business processes including our supply chain pipeline operations gathering and processing operations retail sales credit card payments and authorizations at our retail outlets financial transactions banking and numerous other processes and transactions these information systems involve data network and telecommunications internet access and website functionality and various computer hardware equipment and software applications including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business our systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters software viruses or other malware power failures cyberattacks and other events we also face various other cybersecurity threats from criminal hackers statesponsored intrusion industrial espionage and employee malfeasance including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable 

to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack we have implemented multiple layers of cybersecurity protections infrastructure protection technologies disaster recovery plans and employee training while we have invested significant amounts in the protection of our technology systems and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over personally identifiable customer investor and employee data there can be no guarantee such plans to the extent they are in place will be effective 

certain vendors have access to sensitive information including personally identifiable customer investor and employee data and a breakdown of their technology systems or infrastructure as a result of a cyberattack or otherwise could result in unauthorized disclosure of such information unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or personally identifiable information including by cyberattacks or other security breach could cause loss of data give rise to remediation or other expenses expose us to liability under federal and state laws reduce our customers’ willingness to do business with us disrupt the services we provide to customers and subject us to litigation and investigations which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows state and federal cybersecurity legislation could also impose new requirements which could increase our cost of doing business 

competition in our industry is intense and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business 

we compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies including certain multinational oil companies competitors with integrated operations with exploration and production resources and broader access to resources may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions and to bear the risks inherent in the refining industry for example competitors that engage in exploration and production of crude oil may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

we also face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices several nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business these nontraditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow because of their diversity integration of operations experienced management and greater financial resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market in addition these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts adversely affecting our profit margins 

additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the development availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of the trucks pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners our joint venture partners may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations failure by us or an entity in which we have a jointventure interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred 

we have significant debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

at december 31 2018 our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were  2798 billion  including 1386 billion  of obligations of mplx and 501 billion  of obligations of andx we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

 a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money andor limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn 

entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant any changes in our credit capacity or credit profile could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to 750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables in periods of lower prices we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations including those of mplx and andx and those of our predecessors and andeavor’s predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 4780 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements of these employees approximately 1465 employees at our galveston bay mandan and martinez refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements which were set to expire on january 31 2019 the parties continue their negotiations toward a new agreement and are working under rolling extensions approximately 425 employees at our martinez chemical plant our los angeles refinery and our galveston bay refinery are covered by collective bargaining agreements expiring over the next several months approximately 410 hourly employees at speedway are represented under collective bargaining agreements the majority of these employees work at certain retail locations in new york and new jersey under agreements which expire on march 14 2019 and june 30 2019 respectively the remaining speedway represented employees are drivers in minnesota under an agreement which expires in 2021 approximately 300 employees at our st paul park and gallup refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in 2020 approximately 1620 employees at our anacortes canton catlettsburg los angeles and salt lake city refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire in 2022 the remaining 560 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024 these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us in addition we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition california requires refinery owners to pay prevailing wages to contract craft workers and restricts refiners’ ability to hire qualified employees to a limited pool of applicants legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages higher labor costs and an increased risk that contract employees become joint employees which could trigger bargaining issues employment discrimination liability issues as well as wage and benefit consequences especially during critical maintenance and construction periods 

two of our subsidiaries act as general partners of publicly traded master limited partnerships which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx a publicly traded mlp another of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of andx a publicly traded mlp we acquired control of andx’s general partner through the andeavor acquisition our control of the general partners of mplx and andx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx and andx any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if foreign investment in us or mplx exceeds certain levels mplx could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920 which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens among other requirements to establish citizenship entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by us citizens if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws mplx would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although the spinoff occurred in mid2011 certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil however if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries whether accruing before on or after the spinoff we also agreed to be responsible for and indemnify marathon oil with respect to all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff or certain internal restructuring transactions failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368a and 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation warranty covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement in addition we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified taxrelated liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities at this time we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts 

also in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions that were required to effect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves the tax liabilities and underlying liabilities in the event marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

significant acquisitions in the future will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows 

significant future transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks which may include among others 



 a significant decrease or delay in oil and natural gas production in mplx’s or andx’s areas of operation whether due to sustained declines in oil natural gas and ngl prices natural declines in well production or otherwise may adversely affect mplx’s or andx’s business results of operations and financial condition and could reduce their ability to make distributions to us 

a significant portion of mplx’s operations are dependent upon production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers which will naturally decline over time which means that mplx’s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of mplx’s facilities mplx must continually obtain new oil natural gas and ngl supplies which depends in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities similarly andx’s operations are dependent in part on the production of crude oil in the bakken region and the production of natural gas and ngls in the green river uinta and williston basins 

we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of mplx’s or andx’s operations the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline in addition we have no control over producers or their production decisions which are affected by among other things prevailing and projected energy prices drilling costs per mcf or barrel demand for hydrocarbons operational challenges access to downstream markets the level of reserves geological considerations governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital because of these factors even if new oil or natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by mplx or andx assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves if mplx and andx are not able to obtain new supplies of oil natural gas or ngls to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells throughput on their pipelines and the utilization rates of their facilities would decline which could have a material adverse effect on their business results of operations and financial condition and could reduce their ability to make distributions to us 

decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves the prices for oil natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond our control including global and local demand production levels changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications imports and exports seasonality and weather conditions economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations sustained periods of low prices could result in producers also significantly curtailing or limiting their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil natural gas and ngls to mplx’s and andx’s facilities and adversely affect their revenues and cash available for distribution to us this impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of mplx’s commoditybased contracts which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and ngl prices than its feebased contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a btu equivalent basis than ngl products in addition the purchase and resale of natural gas and ngls in the ordinary course exposes our midstream operations to volatility in natural gas or ngl prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of production processes also the significant volatility in natural gas ngl and oil prices could adversely impact mplx’s or andx’s unit price thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital such impacts could adversely impact mplx’s and andx’s ability to execute its long‑term organic growth projects satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels and may also result in noncash impairments of longlived assets or goodwill or otherthantemporary noncash impairments of our equity method investments 

significant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies as a result stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we do not own all of the land on which our assets are located which could disrupt our operations 

we do not own all of the land on which certain of our assets are located particularly our midstream assets but rather obtain the rights to construct and operate such assets on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time therefore we are subject to the possibility of more burdensome terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if our leases rightsofway or other property rights lapse or terminate or it is determined that we do not have valid leases rightsofway or other property rights our loss of these rights including loss through our inability to renew leases rightofway agreements or permits on satisfactory terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to the andeavor acquisition 

the andeavor acquisition may not be accretive and may be dilutive to mpc’s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share which may negatively affect the market price of shares of mpc common stock 

the andeavor acquisition may not be accretive and may be dilutive to mpc’s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share in the future are based on preliminary estimates that may materially change in addition future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected including 

 any dilution of or decrease or delay of any accretion to mpc’s earnings per share or cash flow from operations per share could cause the price of mpc’s common stock to decline 

mpc has incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the andeavor acquisition which may be in excess of those anticipated by mpc 

mpc has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the andeavor acquisition mpc expects to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies these fees and costs have been and will continue to be substantial 

mpc will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses although mpc expects that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow mpc to offset integrationrelated costs 

over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all see the risk factor below entitled “the integration of andeavor into mpc may not be as successful as anticipated” 

the costs described above as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses could materially and adversely affect mpc’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the integration of andeavor into mpc may not be as successful as anticipated 

the andeavor acquisition involves numerous operational strategic financial accounting legal tax and other risks potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses and uncertainties related to design operation and integration of andeavor’s internal control over financial reporting difficulties in integrating andeavor into mpc may result in legacy andeavor assets performing differently than expected in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated expenserelated efficiencies potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include among other factors 

 mpc’s results may suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the andeavor acquisition 

mpc’s success depends in part on its ability to manage its expansion following the andeavor acquisition which poses numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate the operations and business of andeavor into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers vendors and business partners 

mpc may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the andeavor acquisition 

the success of the andeavor acquisition depends in part on mpc’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining mpc’s and andeavor’s businesses including the annual gross runrate commercial and corporate synergies that mpc expects to realize within the first three years after the combination the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the andeavor acquisition may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected may require more nonrecurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects some of the assumptions that mpc has made such as with respect to anticipated operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies significant longterm cash flow generation the benefit from a substantial increase in scale and geographic diversity complementary growth platforms for both midstream and retail businesses positioning for potentially significant benefits from the international maritime organization change in specifications for marine bunker fuel the expansion in opportunities for logistics growth in crude oil production basins and regions further optimization of crude supply and the continuation of mpc’s investment grade credit profile may not be realized the integration process may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the andeavor acquisition that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence 

we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

we accounted for the andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded to our balance sheet at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill 

as of december 31 2018 our balance sheet reflected 202 billion  and 34 billion  of goodwill and other intangible assets respectively these amounts include the preliminary estimates of goodwill and other intangible assets of 163 billion  and 28 billion  respectively recognized in connection with the andeavor acquisition to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes impaired we may be required to incur material noncash charges relating to such impairment our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment 

risks related to our industry 

meeting the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations which may reduce our refining and marketing margin laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following 

 the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the epa’s national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” are among the regulations that impact our operations in october 2015 the epa reduced the primary health ozone naaqs to 70 ppb from the prior ozone level of 75 ppb on november 6 2017 the epa finalized ozone attainmentunclassifiable designations under the new standard in actions dated april 30 2018 and july 25 2018 the epa finalized nonattainment designations for certain areas under the lower primary ozone standard in some areas these nonattainment designations could result in increased costs associated with or result in cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities states will also be required to adopt sips for nonattainment areas these sips may include nox andor voc reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities we cannot predict the various sip requirements at this time the epa announced that it plans to review the naaqs level for particulate matter “pm” a reduction in the pm naaqs and subsequent designation of nonattainment could also result in increased costs associated with or result in cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities 

the eisa established increases in fuel mileage standards the department of transportation’s national highway safety administration and the epa work in conjunction to establish cafe standards and greenhouse gas emission standards for lightduty vehicles that become more stringent over time in addition pursuant to a waiver granted by the epa california and other states have enacted laws that require vehicle emission reductions increases in fuel mileage standards and requirements for zero emission vehicles may reduce demand for refined product 

the eisa also expanded the renewable fuel standard “rfs” program administered by the epa governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could pose a competitive threat to our operations the eisa required the total 

volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 360 billion gallons by 2022 the rfs presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use gasoline consumption has been lower than forecasted by the epa which has led to concerns that the renewable fuel volumes may not be met on november 30 2018 epa finalized rfs volume requirements for the year 2019 and the biomassbased diesel volume requirement for year 2020 the epa used its cellulosic waiver authority to reduce the volumes for 2019 from the statutory amounts to the following 1992 billion gallons total renewable fuel 492 billion gallons advanced biofuel and 418 million gallons cellulosic biofuel the epa set the biomassbased diesel volume requirement for 2020 at 243 billion gallons which is significantly greater than the statutory floor of 10 billion gallons 

tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may further reduce refined product margins the tax incentives and subsidies are causing uncertainties because they have expired and been reinstituted retroactively the biodiesel credit for example expired at the end of 2016 and was retroactively reinstated in early 2018 it is not certain whether the credit will be reinstituted beyond 2018 

on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm since 2014 we have made approximately 490 million in capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards for 2019 we expect an additional 260 million of capital expenditures to comply with these standards 

federal state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could delay or impede producer’s gas production or result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather process and fractionate while we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations we do provide gathering processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result of such operations if federal state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such legal requirements could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase producers’ costs of compliance 

climate change and greenhouse gas emission regulation could affect our operations energy consumption patterns and regulatory obligations any of which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

currently multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas including carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides and other emissions are in various phases of consideration promulgation or implementation these include actions to develop international federal regional or statewide programs which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments 

for example in california the state legislature adopted sb 32 in 2016 sb 32 set a cap on emissions of 40 below 1990 levels by 2030 but did not establish a particular mechanism to achieve that target the legislature also adopted a companion bill ab 197 that most significantly directs the carb to prioritize direct emission reductions on large stationary sources in 2017 the state legislature adopted ab 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in sb 32 in 2009 carb adopted the low carbon fuel standard “lcfs” the lcfs was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20 reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030 compliance is demonstrated by blending lower carbon intensity biofuels into gasoline and diesel or by purchasing credits compliance with each of the cap and trade and lcfs programs is demonstrated through a marketbased credit system other states are proposing or have already promulgated low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector if we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy increasing concerns about climate change have also resulted in a number of international and national measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions additional stricter measures can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition 

international climate changerelated efforts such as the 2015 united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations though the united states has announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement withdrawal 

it is not possible until november 2019 at the earliest if the united states declines to withdraw the extent of such regulation and the cost associated with compliance cannot be predicted 

we could also face increased climate‐related litigation with respect to our operations or products governmental and other entities in california new york maryland and rhode island have filed lawsuits against coal gas oil and petroleum companies including the company the lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits as well as their potential effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

regulatory and other requirements concerning the transportation of crude oil and other commodities by rail may cause increases in transportation costs or limit the amount of crude oil that we can transport by rail 

we rely on a variety of systems to transport crude oil including rail rail transportation is regulated by federal state and local authorities new regulations or changes in existing regulations could result in increased compliance expenditures for example in 2015 the us department of transportation issued new standards and regulations applicable to crudebyrail transportation enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for highhazard flammable trains these or other regulations that require the reduction of volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail change the design or standards for rail cars used to transport the crude oil we purchase change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil or require any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering north american crude oil by rail could increase the time required to move crude oil from production areas to our refineries increase the cost of rail transportation and decrease the efficiency of shipments of crude oil by rail within our operations any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

severe weather events and other climate conditions may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations 

we have mature systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks such as floods hurricaneforce winds wildfires and snowstorms and potential chronic physical risks such as higher ocean levels if any such events were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations specifically where appropriate we are hardening and modernizing assets against weather damage and ensuring we have resiliency measures in place such as stormspecific readiness plans we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to protect our assets and operations from such physical risks and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks to the extent such severe weather events or other climate conditions increase in frequency and severity we may be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies 

our anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets however policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups one of the ways we may grow our business is through the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing ones the construction of a new pipeline or the expansion of an existing pipeline by adding horsepower or pump stations or by adding additional pipelines along existing pipelines involves numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties most of which are beyond our control the approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry and concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions downstream of pipeline operations in addition government disruptions such as a us federal government shutdown may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business we have experienced construction delays related to these factors as a result of the us federal government’s recent shutdown our expansion or construction projects may not be completed on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost in addition our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project for instance if we build a new pipeline the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing margins 

the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies production companies and trading companies including suppliers from canada the middle east and various other international locations the market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market we are therefore subject to the attendant political geographic and economic risks of such a market if one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our operations sales of refined products and refining and marketing margins could be adversely affected materially and adversely impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from our nonus operations and generally to worldwide political and economic developments 

we have expanded the scope of our nonus operations through the andeavor acquisition particularly in mexico south america and asia our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets including economic instability restrictions on the transfer of funds duties and tariffs transportation delays import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest security issues involving key personnel and changing regulatory and political environments in addition if trade relationships deteriorate with these countries if existing trade agreements are modified or terminated new economic sanctions relevant to such jurisdictions are passed or if taxes border adjustments or tariffs make trading with these countries more costly it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are required to comply with us and international laws and regulations including those involving antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering for example the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage our compliance policies and programs mandate compliance with all applicable anticorruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents actual or alleged violations of 

these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

more broadly political and economic factors in global markets could impact crude oil and other feedstock supplies and could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products ngls and natural gas additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult andor costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability for example the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products ngls natural gas or the conduct of business in or with certain foreign countries in addition foreign countries could restrict imports investments or commercial transactions 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use payroll franchise withholding and property taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties 

terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

the us government has issued warnings that energy assets in general including the nation’s refining pipeline and terminal infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations the threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks any future terrorist attacks on our facilities those of our customers and in some cases those of other pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 



we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are the subject of or a party to a number of pending or threatened legal actions contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters including laws and regulations relating to the environment some of these matters are discussed below 

litigation 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty while it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

between june 20 and july 11 2018 six putative class actions the “actions” were filed against some or all of andeavor the directors of andeavor and mpc mahi inc “merger sub 1” and mahi llc nka andeavor llc “merger sub 2” and together with mpc and merger sub 1 the “mpc defendants” relating to the andeavor merger two complaints malka raul v andeavor et al and stephen bushansky v andeavor et al were filed in the us district court for the western district of texas four complaints captioned the vladimir gusinsky rev trust v andeavor et al lawrence zucker v andeavor et al mel gross v andeavor et al and hudson v andeavor et al were filed in the us district court for the district of delaware the actions generally alleged that andeavor the directors of andeavor and the mpc defendants disseminated a false or misleading registration statement regarding the merger in violation of section 14a of the exchange act and rule 14a9 promulgated thereunder specifically the actions alleged that the registration statement filed by mpc misstated or omitted material information regarding the parties’ financial projections and the analyses performed by andeavor’s and mpc’s respective financial advisors and that disclosure of material information was necessary in light of preclusive deal protection provisions in the merger agreement the financial interests of andeavor’s officers and directors in completing the deal and the financial interests of andeavor’s and mpc’s respective financial advisors the actions further alleged that the directors of andeavor andor the mpc defendants were liable for these violations as “controlling persons” of andeavor under section 20a of the exchange act the actions sought injunctive relief including to enjoin andor rescind the merger damages in the event the merger was consummated and an award of attorneys’ fees in addition to other relief 

on july 5 and july 20 2018 mpc filed amendments to its registration statement on form s4 which included certain supplemental disclosures responding to allegations made by the plaintiffs on august 3 2018 andeavor filed its proxy statement and after that date the parties had numerous discussions regarding the adequacy of disclosures the parties ultimately reached an agreement in principle to resolve the actions in exchange for additional supplemental disclosures consistent with that agreement andeavor and mpc each filed a current report on form 8k on september 14 2018 that included certain additional disclosures in response to plaintiffs’ allegations between september 21 and september 28 2018 all the actions were dismissed as moot and the parties reserved their rights in the event of any dispute over attorneys’ fees and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company resolved the remaining disputes over attorneys’ fees for an amount that was not material to the company 

in may 2015 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against our whollyowned subsidiary marathon petroleum company lp “mpc lp” in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky asserting claims under federal and state antitrust statutes the kentucky consumer protection act and state common law the complaint as amended in july 2015 alleges that mpc lp used deed restrictions supply agreements with customers and exchange agreements with competitors to unreasonably restrain trade in areas within kentucky and seeks declaratory relief unspecified damages civil penalties restitution and disgorgement of profits at this stage the ultimate outcome of this litigation remains uncertain and neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability if any can be determined and we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss for this matter we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 

in may 2007 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against us and marathon oil in state court in franklin county kentucky for alleged violations of kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws following hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 the lawsuit alleges that we overcharged customers by 89 million during september and october 2005 the complaint seeks disgorgement of these sums as well as penalties under kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws we are vigorously defending this litigation we believe that this is the first lawsuit for damages and injunctive relief under the kentucky emergency pricing laws to progress this far and it contains many novel issues in may 2011 the kentucky attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in april and may 2011 under statewide price controls that were activated by the kentucky governor on april 26 2011 and which have since expired the court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief and the remainder of the 2011 claims likely will be resolved along with those dating from 2005 if the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably in its entirety it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

recent developments 

andeavor acquisition 

on october 1 2018 we completed the andeavor acquisition under the terms of the merger agreement andeavor stockholders had the option to choose 187  shares of mpc common stock or 15227  in cash per share of andeavor common stock the merger agreement included election proration provisions that resulted in approximately 229 million  shares of andeavor common stock being converted into cash consideration and the remaining 1282 million  shares of andeavor common stock being converted into stock consideration andeavor stockholders received in the aggregate approximately 2398 million  shares of mpc common stock valued at 198 billion  and approximately 35 billion  in cash in connection with the andeavor acquisition through the andeavor acquisition we acquired the general partner and 156 million common units of andx which is a publicly traded mlp that was formed to own operate develop and acquire logistics assets 

andeavor was a highly integrated marketing logistics and refining company operating primarily in the western and midcontinent united states andeavor’s operations included procuring crude oil from its source or from other third parties transporting the crude oil to one of its 10 refineries and producing marketing and distributing refined products its marketing system included more than 3300 stations marketed under multiple wellknown fuel brands including arco ®  also as noted above we acquired the general partner and 156 million common units of andx a leading growthoriented full service and diversified midstream company which owns and operates networks of crude oil refined products and natural gas pipelines terminals with crude oil and refined products storage capacity rail loading and offloading facilities marine terminals including storage bulk petroleum distribution facilities a trucking fleet and natural gas processing and fractionation complexes 

this transaction combined two strong complementary companies to create a leading nationwide us downstream energy company the acquisition substantially increases our geographic diversification and scale and strengthens each of our operating segments by diversifying our refining portfolio into attractive markets and increasing access to advantaged feedstocks enhancing our midstream footprint in the permian basin and creating a nationwide retail and marketing portfolio all of which is expected to substantially improve efficiencies and our ability to serve customers we expect the combination to generate up to approximately 14 billion in gross runrate synergies within the first three years significantly enhancing our longterm cash flow generation profile

the following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from mplx during 2018  and 2017  and andx distributions received after the october 1 2018 acquisition of andeavor 



we owned approximately 505 million  mplx common units at december 31 2018  with a market value of 1529 billion  based on the december 31 2018  closing unit price of 3030  on january 25 2019  mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of 06475  per common unit which was paid february 14 2019  as a result mplx made distributions totaling 514 million  to its common unitholders mpc’s portion of this distribution was approximately 327 million  

we owned approximately 156 million  andx common units at december 31 2018  with a market value of 507 billion  based on the december 31 2018  closing unit price of 3249  on january 25 2019  andx declared a quarterly cash distribution of 103  per common unit which was paid february 14 2019  as a result andx made distributions totaling 238 million  to its common unitholders mpc’s portion of this distribution was approximately 146 million

share repurchases 

during the year ended december 31 2018  we returned 329 billion  to our shareholders through repurchases of 47 million  shares of common stock at an average price per share of 6946  these repurchases were funded primarily by after tax proceeds from the february 1 2018 dropdown to mplx 

since january 1 2012 our board of directors has approved 180 billion  in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of 1310 billion  of our common stock leaving 49 billion  available for repurchases as of december 31 2018  under these authorizations we have acquired 293 million  shares at an average cost per share of 4460  

liquidity 

as of december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of 161 billion  excluding mplx’s and andx’s cash and cash equivalents of 68 million  and 10 million  respectively and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our 60 billion bank revolving credit facilities or under our 750 million trade receivables securitization facility “trade receivables facility” as of december 31 2018  eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of 750 million  under the trade receivable facility as of december 31 2018  mplx had approximately 225 billion  available under its 225 billion  revolving credit agreement and 1 billion available through its intercompany loan agreement with mpc as of december 31 2018  andx had 855 million  available under its 210 billion revolving credit agreements and 500 million available through its intercompany loan agreement with mpc

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining  marketing margin and refinery throughputs our total refining capacity was 3021  mbpcd 1881  mbpcd and 1817  mbpcd as of december 31 2018  2017  and 

2016  respectively the increase in 2018 was primarily due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 which added 10 refineries with approximately 1117  mbpcd of total refining capacity 

our refining  marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants we calculate west coast midcontinent and gulf coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products the following will be used for these crackspread calculations 

 our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil the amount of this discount the sweetsour differential can vary significantly causing our refining  marketing margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil in general a larger sweetsour differential will enhance our refining  marketing margin 

future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors as well as us energy policy 

the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions   

 in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sour differential and the sweet differential our refining  marketing margin is impacted by factors such as 

 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market costs of crude oil refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values at december 31 2018  market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

refining  marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs which include turnaround and major maintenance depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses changes in 

manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs planned major maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years and only reflects the activity for the acquired refineries after october 1 2018 



we have various longterm feebased commercial agreements with mplx and andx under these agreements mplx and andx which are reported in our midstream segment provide transportation storage distribution and marketing services to our refining  marketing segment certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil refined products and other products certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets 

retail 

our retail fuel margin for gasoline and distillate which is the price paid by consumers or direct dealers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees where applicable impacts the retail  segment profitability gasoline and distillate prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply and demand in the regions where we operate numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year including local competition seasonal demand fluctuations the available wholesale supply the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions according to current estimates 2018 gasoline demand remained at 93 million barrels per day for the third consecutive year headwinds from a fouryear high in average gasoline prices during 2018 offset the gasoline demand support from continuing economic growth and slowing fleet fuel efficiency gains meanwhile distillate demand was up for the second consecutive year on continuing economic growth in 2018 rising 52 percent from 2017 to the highest level since 2007 and the third highest us demand level ever truck tonnage posted its largest annual increase since 1998 rising 66 percent year over year in 2018 while port container traffic at the 10 largest us ports grew 45 percent year over year in 2018 through november the margin on merchandise sold at our convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to our retail segment margin almost half of our retail margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2018  this percentage decreased from 2017 due to the addition of longterm fuel supply contracts with direct dealers and fuel only locations as part of the andeavor acquisition our retail convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items 

inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value costs of refined products and merchandise are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values as of december 31 2018  market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

midstream   

our midstream segment transports stores distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for our refining  marketing segment the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines the profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges the profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals the profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products the profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our refining  marketing segment and our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our refining  marketing segment as discussed above in the refining  marketing section mplx and andx which are reported in our midstream segment have various longterm feebased commercial agreements related to services provided to our refining  marketing segment under these agreements mplx and andx have received various commitments of minimum throughput storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines terminals and marine 

operations key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport store distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers such prices also affect profitability 

results of operations 

the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  the 2018  amounts include the results of andeavor from the october 1 2018 acquisition date forward this discussion should be read in conjunction with item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 

consolidated results of operations 



 2018  compared to 2017   

net income attributable to mpc decreased   652 million  increased income from operations was more than offset by a tax benefit of 15 billion resulting from the tcja in 2017 and increased income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2018  see segment results for additional information 

total revenues and other income increased 2173 billion  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to 



financial statements and supplementary data – notes 2  and 3  for additional information on recently adopted accounting standards 

 total costs and expenses increased 2018 billion  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to 

 net interest and other financial costs increased   329 million  mainly due to increased mplx borrowings and debt assumed in the acquisition of andeavor in addition mplx recognized 60 million of debt extinguishment costs in 2018 in connection with the redemption of its 750 million of senior notes due in 2023 we capitalized interest of 80 million  in 2018  and 55 million  in 2017  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for further details 

provision for income taxes increased   142 billion  primarily due to the absence of a tax benefit of 15 billion in 2017  resulting from the tcja and an increase in our income before income taxes which increased   122 billion  the effective tax rate of 21 percent  in 2018  is consistent with the us statutory rate of 21 percent  as permanent benefit differences related to income attributable to noncontrolling interest were offset by state and local tax expense in 2017  our effective tax rate was impacted by 45  percentage points as a result of the tcja which decreased our effective tax rate from 31 percent to 14  percent the effective tax rate excluding the tcja of 31 percent in 2017  was slightly less than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences including differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12  for further details 

noncontrolling interests increased 454 million due to higher mplx net income resulting primarily from the february 1 2018 dropdown transaction partially offset by the reduced ownership in mplx held by noncontrolling interests following the gpidr exchange noncontrolling ownership in mplx decreased to 364 percent at december 31 2018  from 696 percent at december 31 2017  in addition 2018 reflects 68 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in andx of 364 percent for the period from october 1 2018 through the end of the year 

2017  compared to 2016 

net income attributable to mpc increased   226 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to a tax benefit of 15 billion resulting from the tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase in our refining  marketing segment income from operations of 964 million see segment results for additional information 

total revenues and other income increased 1201 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to 



 total costs and expenses increased 1037 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to 

 net interest and other financial costs increased   110 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  mainly due to the mplx senior notes issued in february 2017 and a 45 million increase in pension settlement expenses partially offset by decreased borrowings on the mpc term loan agreement we capitalized interest of 55 million  in 2017  and 63 million  in 2016  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for further details 

provision for income taxes decreased   107 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  the tcja was signed into law on december 22 2017 and provided several key changes to us tax law including a federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent  replacing the 2017  rate applicable to mpc of 35 percent mpc was required to calculate the effect of the tcja on its deferred tax balances as of the enactment date the effect of the federal corporate income tax rate change reduced net deferred tax liabilities by 15 billion  in 2017 this benefit was partially offset by an increase in our income before income taxes which increased   152 billion  in 2017 compared to 2016 the tcja impacted our effective tax rate by 45  percentage points in 2017  decreasing our effective tax rate from 31 percent to 14  percent the effective tax rates excluding the tcja in 2017 of 31 percent in 2017  and 33 percent  in 2016  are slightly less than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences including differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12  for further details 

noncontrolling interests increased 333 million primarily due to increased mplx net income 

segment results 

our segment income from operations was approximately 626 billion  439 billion  and 314 billion  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the following shows the percentage of segment income from operations by segment for the last three years 

refining  marketing 

 

 

2018  compared to 2017   

the following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business with the acquisition of andeavor we revised our market data to include a west coast 321 crack spread additionally the chicago 6321 crack spread was revised to reflect a midcontinent 321 crack spread and the gulf coast 6321 crack spread was also revised to reflect a 321 crack spread see the “overview of segments” section for further discussion of our revised crack spreads 



 refining  marketing segment revenues increased   1791 billion  primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes which increased   402  mbpd and higher refined product sales prices which increased   034  per gallon the increase in sales volumes is largely due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 these increases were partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under asc 606 prospectively from january 1 2018 which resulted in a decrease in refining  marketing segment revenues of 458 billion in 2018  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 2  and 3  for additional information on recently adopted accounting standards 

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased   160 million  primarily due to higher throughputs as a result of the andeavor acquisition as well as wider sour and sweet crude differentials for comparison purposes as noted in the market indicators table 2017 indicators have been included which reflect the new indicators we began using subsequent to the acquisition of andeavor based on this the usgc midcontinent and west coast blended 321 crack spread was 1062  per barrel in 2018  as compared to 1022  per barrel in 2017  these crack spreads are net of rin crack adjustments of 161  and 357  for 2018  and 2017  respectively 

based on changes in the market indicators shown above and our refinery throughputs we estimate a positive  impact of 340 billion  on refining  marketing segment income from operations of which 181 billion  and 159 billion  are due to the effects of changes in price and volume respectively the market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales differences in our results compared to these market indicators including product price realizations the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of lcm inventory valuation adjustments the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances had an estimated negative  impact on refining  marketing segment income from operations of 698 million  in 2018 compared to 2017 the significant elements of the negative impact were unfavorable crude acquisition costs and unfavorable product price realizations relative to the market indicators 

the cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the lifo method there were no material liquidations of lifo inventories in 2018  and we recognized a lifo charge of 7 million in 2017  

refinery direct operating costs decreased   012  per barrel in 2018  compared to 2017  the decrease includes a 013  per barrel decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs and a 012  per barrel decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily due to higher refinery throughput resulting from the addition of 10 refineries as part of the acquisition of andeavor total turnaround costs increased due to costs related to these additional refineries as well as higher turnaround costs at our detroit and canton refineries partially offset by lower turnaround costs at our galveston bay and garyville refineries the increase in other manufacturing costs of 013  per barrel is mainly due to costs associated with the acquired refineries partially offset by an increase in throughput due to the acquisition of andeavor in addition manufacturing costs and depreciation and amortization costs per barrel decreased due to the dropdown of refining and logistics assets to mplx on february 1 2018 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 316 million in 2018  compared to 457 million in 2017  the decrease in 2018  was primarily due to lower weighted average rin costs which more than offset the increase in our rins obligation subsequent to the acquisition of andeavor 

2017  compared to 2016 

the following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business 



 refining  marketing segment revenues increased 1087 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher refined product sales prices and volumes 

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased   964 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  segment income in 2016 includes a 345 million noncash benefit related to the company’s lcm inventory reserve excluding the lcm inventory 

benefit the increase in segment results for 2017 primarily resulted from higher lls crack spreads in both the us gulf coast and chicago markets the lls blended crack spread for 2017 increased to 984  per barrel from 696  per barrel in 2016 these favorable effects were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared to the spot market prices used in the lls blended crack spread 

based on changes in the market indicators shown above and our refinery throughputs we estimate a positive impact of 233 billion for 2017  compared to 2016  on refining  marketing segment income from operations the market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales differences in our results compared to these market indicators including product price realizations the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of lcm inventory valuation adjustments the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances had an estimated negative impact on refining  marketing segment income from operations of 135 billion in 2017  compared to 2016  the significant elements of the negative impact were unfavorable product price realizations and unfavorable crude acquisition costs relative to the market indicators 

the cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the lifo method in the second quarter of 2016 we had recognized the effects of an interim liquidation of our refined products inventories which we did not expect to reinstate by year end resulting in a pretax charge of approximately 54 million to income based on year end refined product inventories which were higher than inventories at the beginning of the year we had a build in refined product inventories for 2016 therefore we recognized the effects of this annual build in our refined products in the fourth quarter of 2016 which had the effect of reversing the second quarter charge for the full year we recognized a lifo charge of 7 million in 2017 and 2 million in 2016 

refinery direct operating costs decreased 017 per barrel in 2017  compared to 2016  the decrease in 2017 includes an 011 per barrel decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs resulting from lower turnaround activity at our garyville and robinson refineries partially offset by higher activity at our catlettsburg refinery 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 457 million in 2017  and 288 million in 2016  the increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher weighted average rin costs driven by higher market prices for purchased rins and increases in the number of rins purchased 

supplemental refining  marketing statistics 







retail   

 





2018   compared to   2017   

retail  segment revenues increased   452 billion  the majority of this increase is due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 which added companyowned and operated retail locations which are included in speedway fuel sales and direct dealer locations the existing retail business also saw a 118 billion increase in fuel and merchandise sales total fuel sales increased 521 billion  primarily due to an increase in speedway fuel sales volumes of 494 million  gallons the addition of direct dealer fuel sales of 644 million  gallons and an increase in average gasoline and distillate selling prices of 037  per gallon merchandise sales increased 339 million  the increases in speedway fuel sales and merchandise sales as well as the addition of sales to direct dealers were primarily due to the acquisition of andeavor these increases were partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under asc 606 prospectively from january 1 2018 which resulted in a decrease in retail segment revenues of 844 million in 2018  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 2  and 3  for additional information on recently adopted accounting standards 

retail  segment income from operations increased   299 million  primarily due to contributions from the retail operations acquired in the andeavor acquisition for locations owned prior to the andeavor acquisition increased gasoline and distillate and merchandise margins were more than offset by increased operating expenses 

2017  compared to 2016 

retail  segment revenues increased   747 million  due to an increase  in fuel sales of 860 million partially offset by a decrease in merchandise sales of 114 million average fuel selling prices increased 025 per gallon which were partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes in 2017  compared to 2016  the decreases in fuel sales volumes and merchandise sales are primarily attributable to the contribution of 41 travel centers to pjf southeast in fourth quarter of 2016 

retail  segment income from operations decreased 4 million segment income in 2016 includes a 25 million noncash benefit related to the reversal of the company’s lcm inventory reserve which was recorded in 2015 excluding the lcm inventory benefit recognized in 2016 the increase in segment results for 2017 was primarily due to a full year of contributions from speedway’s travel center joint venture formed in the fourth quarter 2016 and lower operating expense partially offset by lower merchandise margin and lower gains from asset sales 

midstream 

 

 



 2018  compared to 2017   

on february 1 2018 we completed the dropdown of our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to mplx which is reported in our midstream segment refining logistics contains the integrated tank farm assets that support mpc’s refining operations fuels distribution is structured to provide a broad range of scheduling and marketing services as mpc’s agent these new businesses were reported in the midstream segment prospectively from february 1 2018 no effect was given to prior periods as these entities were not considered businesses prior to february 1 2018 

midstream  segment revenue and income from operations increased   290 billion  and 141 billion  respectively revenue increased 194 billion  primarily due to fees charged for fuels distribution and refining logistics services following the february 1 2018 dropdown to mplx in addition to services provided by andx following the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018 revenues also increased by approximately 502 million  due to asc 606 gross ups see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3  for additional information 

in 2018  midstream segment income from operations includes 230 million due to contributions from andx and 874 million  from the refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services contributed to mplx on february 1 2018 prior period midstream segment results do not reflect the impact of these new businesses the incremental 309 million increase in midstream segment results in 2018  was driven by record gathered processed and fractionated volumes and record pipeline throughput volumes for mplx 

2017  compared to 2016 

midstream  segment revenue and income from operations increased 675 million  and 291 million  respectively primarily due to increased revenue from higher natural gas and ngl gathering processing and fractionation volumes and changes in natural gas and ngl prices segment results also benefited from the first quarter 2017 acquisitions of the ozark pipeline and our ownership interest in the bakken pipeline system the comparison for 2017 and 2016 also reflects the absence of any revenues for the terminal services provided to the refining  marketing segment in the first quarter of 2016 versus the inclusion of revenues for these services in the first quarter of 2017 these assets were not considered a business prior to april 1 2016 and therefore no financial results for these assets were available from which to recast first quarter 2016 midstream segment results 

items not allocated to segments 



 2018  compared to 2017   

corporate and other unallocated expenses increased   137 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  largely due to increased costs and expenses for the combined company after the andeavor acquisition on october 1 2018 

other unallocated items in 2018 include 197 million of transactionrelated costs for financial advisors employee severance and other costs associated with the andeavor acquisition and mpc’s share of gains from the sale of assets remaining from the canceled sandpiper pipeline project other unallocated items in 2017 include an 86 million litigation charge a litigation benefit of 57 million and a benefit of 23 million related to mpc’s share of gains from the sale of assets remaining from the canceled sandpiper pipeline project 

2017  compared to 2016 

corporate and other unallocated expenses increased   99 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  largely due to higher unallocated corporate costs and increases in employeerelated expenses and corporate costs 

other unallocated items in 2017 include an 86 million litigation charge a litigation benefit of 57 million and a benefit of 23 million related to mpc’s share of gains from the sale of assets remaining from the canceled sandpiper pipeline project other unallocated items in 2016 include impairment charges of 486 million resulting from noncash charges of 267 million related to the indefinite deferral of the sandpiper pipeline project 130 million related to the goodwill recognized in connection with the markwest merger and 89 million related to an mplx equity method investment 

nongaap financial measures 

management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with gaap “nongaap” we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to its most comparable gaap financial measure they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the nongaap financial measures we use are as follows 

refining  marketing margin 

refining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes the lcm inventory market adjustment 



 retail fuel margin 

retail fuel margin is defined as the price paid by consumers or direct dealers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees where applicable and excluding any lcm inventory market adjustment 

retail merchandise margin 

retail merchandise margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of merchandise 





liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 169 billion  at december 31 2018  compared to 301 billion  at december 31 2017  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table 



net cash provided by operating activities decreased   454 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to an unfavorable  change in working capital of 228 billion  partially offset by an increase in operating results net cash provided by operating activities increased 260 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increased operating results and favorable changes in working capital of 174 billion compared to 2017 the above changes in working capital exclude changes in shortterm debt 

for 2018  changes in working capital were a net 340 million  use of cash primarily due to the effect of decreases in energy commodity prices on working capital accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices inventories decreased primarily due to a decrease in crude and refined product inventories current receivables decreased primarily due to lower crude oil receivable prices all of these effects exclude the working capital acquired in connection with the acquisition of andeavor 

for 2017 changes in working capital were a net 194 billion source of cash primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices on working capital accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes and prices current receivables increased primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product receivable prices and volumes and inventories decreased primarily due to lower crude oil inventory volumes 

for 2016 changes in working capital were a net 200 million source of cash primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices on working capital accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable prices current 

receivables increased primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil receivable prices and inventories increased excluding the change in the company’s inventory valuation reserve of 370 million primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product inventory volumes 

cash flows used in investing activities increased   427 billion  in 2018  compared to 2017  and increased 431 million in 2017 compared to 2016 

 the consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash a reconciliation of additions to property plant and equipment to total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years 



 financing activities were a source of cash of 222 million  in 2018  and uses of cash of 109 billion  in 2017  and 129 billion in 2016 



noncontrolling interests also included andx’s distribution per common unit paid in the fourth quarter subsequent to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1 2018

capital resources 

our liquidity totaled 83 billion  at december 31 2018  consisting of 



 because of the alternatives available to us including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets including a commercial paper program we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm and longterm funding requirements including capital spending programs the repurchase of shares of our common stock dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies 

on november 15 2018 mplx issued 225 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering consisting of 750 million  aggregate principal amount of 4800 percent  unsecured senior notes due february 2029 and 15 billion  aggregate principal amount of 5500 percent  unsecured senior notes due february 2049 on december 10 2018 a portion of the net proceeds from the offering was used to redeem the 750 million  in aggregate principal amount of 5500 percent  unsecured notes due february 2023 issued by mplx and markwest these notes were redeemed at 101833 percent  of the principal amount plus the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 60 million  the remaining net proceeds have or will be used to repay borrowings under mplx’s revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with mpc and for general partnership purposes 

on february 8 2018 mplx issued 55 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering consisting of 500 million  aggregate principal amount of 3375 percent  unsecured senior notes due march 2023 125 billion  aggregate principal amount of 4000 percent  unsecured senior notes due march 2028 175 billion  aggregate principal amount of 4500 percent  unsecured senior notes due april 2038 15 billion  aggregate principal amount of 4700 percent  unsecured senior notes due april 2048 and 500 million  aggregate principal amount of 4900 percent  unsecured senior notes due april 2058 on february 8 2018 41 billion  of the net proceeds were used to repay the 364day termloan facility which was used to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the dropdown of refining logistics assets and distribution services to mplx the remaining proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under mplx’s revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with mpc and for general partnership purposes 

commercial paper  – we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of 2 billion  in commercial paper outstanding with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities at december 31 2018  we had no  amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program 

mpc bank revolving credit facilities  – on august 28 2018 in connection with the andeavor acquisition we entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of lenders to replace mpc’s previous fiveyear 25 billion  bank revolving credit facility due in 2022 and our previous 364day 1 billion  bank revolving agreement that expired in july 2018 the new credit agreements which became effective october 1 2018 provide for a 5 billion   five year revolving credit facility that expires in 2023 and a 1 billion   364 day revolving credit facility that expires in 2019 the financial covenants and the interest rate terms contained in the new credit agreements are substantially the same as those contained in the previous bank revolving credit facilities there were no borrowings and approximately 32 million  of letters of credit outstanding under these facilities at december 31 2018  

trade receivables facility  – our trade receivables facility has a borrowing capacity of 750 million  depending on the amount of our eligible domestic trade accounts receivable and a maturity date of july 19 2019  as of december 31 2018  eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of 750 million  there were no  borrowings outstanding at december 31 2018  availability under our trade receivables facility is primarily a function of refined product selling prices 

mplx credit agreement  – on july 21 2017 mplx entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace the existing 2 billion   five year bank revolving credit facility with a 225 billion   five year bank revolving credit facility with a maturity date of july 2022  “mplx credit agreement” at december 31 2018  mplx had no  outstanding borrowings and 3 million  of letters of credit outstanding under the bank revolving credit facility resulting in total unused loan availability of approximately 225 billion  

andx credit agreements   through the andeavor acquisition on october 1 2018 we acquired the general partner and 156 million units of andx andx is party to a 11 billion  revolving credit agreement and a 10 billion  dropdown credit agreement both of which expire in january 2021 together the “andx credit agreements” as of december 31 2018  andx had approximately 125 billion  outstanding borrowings under the andx credit agreements resulting in total unused loan availability of 855 million  

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for further discussion of our debt 

the mpc credit agreements contain representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types the financial covenant included in the mpc credit agreements requires us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization as defined in the mpc credit agreements of no greater than 065 to 100 other covenants restrict us andor certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the mpc credit agreements including a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 019  to 100 as well as the other covenants contained in the mpc credit agreements 

the mplx credit agreement contains certain representations and warranties affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type the mplx credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the mplx credit agreement for the prior four  fiscal quarters of no greater than 50  to 10 or 55  to 10 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period other covenants restrict mplx andor certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2018  mplx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement including a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 380  to 10 

the andx credit agreements contain certain representations and warranties affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type including a financial covenant that requires andx to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the andx credit agreements for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 50  to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters or 55  to 10 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions consolidated ebitda used to calculate the consolidated leverage ratio is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period the covenants also restrict among other things andx’s ability andor the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to incur debt create liens on assets and enter into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2018  andx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the andx credit agreements including a consolidated leverage ratio of 372  to 10 

as disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3  to our audited consolidated financial statements we expect the adoption of the lease accounting standard update to result in the recognition of a significant lease obligation the mpc bank revolving credit facility the mplx credit agreement and the andx credit agreements contain provisions under which the effects of the new accounting standard are not recognized for purposes of financial covenant calculations 

our intention is to maintain an investmentgrade credit profile as of february 1 2019 the credit ratings on our mplx’s and andx’s senior unsecured debt are as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investmentgrade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

none of the mpc credit agreements the mplx credit agreement the andx credit agreements or our trade receivables facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under such agreements in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investmentgrade levels could under certain circumstances decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements 

capital requirements 

for information about our capital expenditures and investments see the “capital spending” section 

in 2018  we made pension contributions totaling 115 million  we have no required funding for 2019  but may make voluntary contributions at our discretion 

on january 28 2019  we announced our board of directors approved a 053  per share dividend payable march 11 2019  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 20 2019  

we may from time to time repurchase notes in the open market in privatelynegotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate 

share repurchases 

since january 1 2012 our board of directors has approved 180 billion  in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of 1310 billion  of our common stock leaving 49 billion  available for repurchases as of december 31 2018  under these authorizations we have acquired 293 million  shares at an average cost per share of 4460  as part of our strategic actions to enhance shareholder value for the year ended december 31 2018  cash proceeds received from dropdowns to mplx during the year were used in part to repurchase 329 billion  of our common stock the table below summarizes our total share repurchases see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 9  for further discussion of the share repurchase plans 



we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market repurchases negotiated block transactions accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing and amount of future repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time 

contractual cash obligations 

the table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31 2018  the contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to mplx and andx under various feebased commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 



 capital spending 

the 2019 capital investment plan for mpc mplx and andx and capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below mpc’s capital investment plan for 2019  totals approximately 28 billion  for capital projects and investments excluding mplx andx capitalized interest and acquisitions mpc’s 2019 capital investment plan includes all of the planned capital spending for refining  marketing retail and corporate as well as a portion of the planned capital investments in midstream the remainder of the planned capital spending for midstream reflects the capital investment plans for mplx and andx we continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant 





refining  marketing 

the refining  marketing segment’s forecasted 2019  capital spending and investments is approximately 18 billion  this amount includes approximately 102 billion  of growth capital focused on refinery optimization production of higher value products increased capacity to upgrade residual fuel oil and expanded export capacity investing to enhance margins we will continue our disciplined highreturn investments in resid upgrading capacity and the ability to produce more diesel we also plan to continue investing in domestic light products supply placement flexibility as well as increasing our export capacity sustaining capital is approximately 730 million  which includes approximately 260 million related to regulatory spending for tier 3 gasoline 

major capital projects completed over the last three years have prepared us to increase our diesel production process light crude oil increase our export capabilities and meet the upcoming transportation fuel regulatory mandate tier 3 fuel standards in addition the star investment project intended to transform our galveston bay refinery into a worldclass refining complex is progressing according to plan and is scheduled to complete in 2022 

retail 

the retail  segment’s 2019  capital forecast of approximately 500 million  is focused on conversion of recently acquired locations to the speedway brand and systems growth in existing and new markets dealer sites commercial fuelingdiesel expansion food service through store remodels and high quality acquisitions 

major capital projects over the last three years included building new store locations remodeling and rebuilding existing locations in core markets and building out our network of commercial fueling lane locations to capitalize on diesel demand growth we also invested in the conversion remodel and maintenance of stores acquired in 2014 

midstream   

mplx’s capital investment plan includes 22 billion  of organic growth capital and approximately 200 million  of maintenance capitalthis growth plan includes the addition of approximately 765 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity at five gas processing plants two in the marcellus basin and three in the southwest which expands mplx’s processing capacity in the permian basin and the stack shale play of oklahoma the growth plan also includes the addition of approximately 100 mbpd of fractionation capacity in the marcellus and utica basins continued expansion of mplx’s marine fleet and other projects including the permian longhaul crude oil natural gas and ngl pipelines as well as export facility projects which will further enhance our full value chain capture 

major capital projects over the last three years included investments for the development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure to support mplx’s producer customers primarily in the marcellus and utica shale regions development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects including a buildout of utica shale infrastructure in connection with the cornerstone pipeline a butane cavern in robinson illinois and a tank farm expansion in texas city texas 

andx’s capital investment plan includes 600 million  of organic growth capital and approximately 100 million  of maintenance capital the growth plan includes the construction of additional crude storage capacity for unloading of marine vessels the construction of a crude gathering system to provide connectivity to multiple longhaul pipelines and a pipeline interconnect project designed to provide direct connectivity between certain mpc refineries 

the remaining midstream   segment’s forecasted 2019  capital spend excluding mplx and andx is approximately 500 million  which primarily relates to investments in equity affiliate pipelines including our expected investments in the gray oak pipeline a new pipeline spanning from the west texas permian basin to the gulf coast which is expected to be in service by the end of 2019 

corporate and other 

the 2019  capital forecast includes approximately 60 million  to support corporate activities major projects over the last three years included an expansion project for our corporate headquarters and upgrades to information technology systems 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity capital resources and results of operations even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the offbalance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources 

we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil these arrangements are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25  

transactions with related parties 

we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted on terms comparable to those with unaffiliated parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7  for discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers for additional information see item 1a risk factors 

our environmental expenditures including nonregulatory expenditures for each of the last three years were 



 we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation or regulations it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for ten  percent twelve  percent and eleven  percent of capital expenditures for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively excluding acquisitions our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 420 million  or 7 percent  of total planned capital expenditures in 2019  actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed the amount of expenditures in 2019  is also dependent upon the resolution of the matters described in item 3 legal proceedings which may require us to complete additional projects and increase our actual environmental capital and operating expenditures 

for more information on environmental regulations that impact us or could impact us see item 1 business  – environmental matters item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

 valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 



impairment assessments of longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions including 

 we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ materially from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a poor outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes a significant reduction in natural gas or ngls processed a significant reduction in refining or retail fuel margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets companyowned convenience store locations for retail  segment assets and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream  segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value 

unlike longlived assets goodwill is subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing at december 31 2018  we had a total of 2018 billion  of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet including 1631 billion that was preliminarily recognized as a result of the andeavor acquisition and remains subject to finalization within one year of the october 1 2018 acquisition date 

for the reporting units included in our annual impairment testing for 2018 the analysis resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 14 percent to 4608 percent the reporting unit with fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately 14 percent has goodwill of 228 million at december 31 2018  an increase of one percentage to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of november 30 2018 significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units’ fair value included estimates of future cash flows if estimates for future cash flows which are impacted by commodity prices and producers’ production plans were to decline the overall reporting units’ fair value would decrease resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value at december 31 2018  we had 590 billion  of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 14  for additional information on our equity method investments see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 16  for additional information on our goodwill and intangibles 

acquisitions 

in accounting for business combinations acquired assets assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired if any is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain respectively a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property plant and equipment intangible assets contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and for certain acquisitions engage thirdparty consultants for valuation assistance 

the fair value of assets and liabilities including contingent consideration as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches including the income approach which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate the cost approach which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entityspecific differences the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ materially from the projected results used to determine fair value 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5  for additional information on our acquisitions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for additional information on fair value measurements 

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

variable interest entities 

we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests variable interests can be contractual ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie’s assets when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated 

significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie we evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest andor if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group we continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions 

changes in the design or nature of the activities of a vie or our involvement with a vie may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity’s status as a vie andor our status as the primary beneficiary such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization this could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary which would have a significant impact on our financial statements 

variable interest entities are discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6  

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 



 we utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuaries’ discount rate models these models calculate an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using yield curves derived from aa or higher bond yields the yield curves represent a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 421 percent for our pension plans and 426 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 69 million and 31 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 8 million and 1 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 42 percent equity securities and 58 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness we used the 615 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2018 defined benefit pension expense after evaluating activity in the capital markets along with the current and projected plan investments we did not change the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 615 percent effective for 2019 decreasing the 615 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 4 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

we utilized the 2018 mortality tables from the us society of actuaries 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22  includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

contingent liabilities 

we accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions claims litigation environmental remediation tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and thirdparty indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable we regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons for instance settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes which are recorded as other taxes for additional information on contingent liabilities see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – environmental matters and compliance costs 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

as discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3  to our audited consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2018  we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 17  and 18  for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

refining  marketing 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also authorize the use of the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below lifo inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts but we also enter into overthecounter swaps options and overthecounter options we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

midstream 

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond mplx’s and andx’s control a portion of mplx’s and andx’s profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at its own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by mplx’s and andx’s producer customers such prices also indirectly affect profitability mplx has a committee comprised of senior management that oversees risk management activities continually monitors the risk management program and adjusts its strategy as conditions warrant derivative contracts utilized for crude oil natural gas and ngls are swaps and options traded on the otc market and fixed price forward contracts as a result of mplx’s current derivative positions it believes that it has mitigated a portion of its expected commodity price risk through the fourth quarter of 2019 mplx would be exposed to additional commodity risk in certain situations such as if producers under‑deliver or over‑deliver products or if processing facilities are operated in different recovery modes in the event that mplx has derivative positions in excess of the product delivered or expected to be delivered the excess derivative positions may be terminated andx does not hedge its exposure using commodity derivative instruments because of the minimal impact of commodity price risk on its liquidity financial position and results of operations 

mplx management conducts a standard credit review on counterparties to derivative contracts and it has provided the counterparties with a guaranty as credit support for its obligations a separate agreement with certain counterparties allows markwest liberty midstream to enter into derivative positions without posting cash collateral mplx uses standardized agreements that allow for offset of certain positive and negative exposures in the event of default or other terminating events including bankruptcy 

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the following table includes the composition of net lossesgains on our commodity derivative positions for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 18  for additional information on our open derivative positions at december 31 2018  

sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2018  is provided in the following table 



we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2018  would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

our use of fixed or variablerate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk fixed rate debt such as our senior notes exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates or that our current fixed rate debt may be higher than the current market variablerate debt such as borrowings under our revolving credit facilities exposes us to shortterm changes in market rates that impact our interest expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for additional information on our debt 

sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint change in interest rates on longterm debt including the portion classified as current and excluding capital leases as of december 31 2018  is provided in the following table fair value of cash and cash equivalents receivables accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the shortterm maturity of the instruments accordingly these instruments are excluded from the table 



 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for additional information on the fair value of our debt 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2018  

counterparty risk 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment by our customers to whom we provide services or sell natural gas or ngls we believe that certain contracts would allow us to pass those losses through to our customers thus reducing our risk when we are selling ngls and acting as our producer customers’ agent our credit exposure related to these customers is represented by the value of our trade receivables where exposed to credit risk we analyze the customer’s financial condition prior to entering into a transaction or agreement establish credit terms and monitor the appropriateness of these terms on an ongoing basis in the event of a customer default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by counterparties or future commission merchants our credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date these outstanding instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements should the creditworthiness of one or more of our counterparties decline our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party in the event of a counterparty default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted this counterparty credit risk does not apply to our embedded derivative as the overall value is a liability we regularly review the creditworthiness of counterparties and futures commission merchants and enter into master netting agreements when appropriate 

these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forwardlooking statements with respect to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to interest rates as well as market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil other refinery feedstocks refined products natural gas ngls and ethanol if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements

 item 1 business 

overview 

marathon petroleum corporation “mpc” has 130  years of experience in the energy business with roots tracing back to the formation of the ohio oil company in 1887 we are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining marketing retail and transportation businesses in the united states and the largest east of the mississippi we are one of the largest natural gas processors in the united states and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions 

our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing speedway and midstream  each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 10  for operating segment and geographic financial information which is incorporated herein by reference 

corporate history and structure 

mpc was incorporated in delaware on november 9 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of marathon oil corporation “marathon oil” on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its refining marketing  transportation business “rmt business” into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil common stock on june 30 2011 the “spinoff” following the spinoff marathon oil retained no ownership interest in mpc and each company has separate public ownership boards of directors and management all subsidiaries and equity method investments not contributed by marathon oil to mpc remained with marathon oil and together with marathon oil are referred to as the “marathon oil companies” on july 1 2011 our common stock began trading “regularway” on the nyse under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

mplx is a diversified growthoriented publicly traded master limited partnership “mlp” formed by us in 2012 to own operate develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets mplx is engaged in the gathering processing and transportation of natural gas the gathering transportation fractionation storage and marketing of ngls and the gathering transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products on december 4 2015 we completed the markwest merger whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx 

as of december 31 2017  we owned a 304 percent  interest in mplx including a two percent  general partner interest mplx is a vie because the limited partners of mplx do not have substantive kickout or substantive participating rights over the general partner we are the primary beneficiary of mplx because in addition to significant economic interest we also have the power through our 100 percent  ownership of the general partner to control the decisions that most significantly impact mplx we therefore consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the interest owned by the public the creditors of mplx do not have recourse to mpc’s general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements the assets of mplx are the property of mplx and cannot be used to satisfy the obligations of mpc 

recent developments 

strategic actions to enhance shareholder value 

on january 3 2017 we announced plans to significantly accelerate the dropdown of assets with an estimated 14 billion of mlpeligible annual ebitda to mplx and to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of mplx including idrs for newly issued mplx common units in 2017 in connection with these plans we contributed assets to mplx with projected annual ebitda of approximately 400 million for 193 billion of cash and approximately 31 million  mplx 

common units and general partner units on february 1 2018 we completed the dropdown of the remaining identified assets which included our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services with projected annual ebitda of approximately 1 billion in exchange for 41 billion of cash and 114 million mplx common units and general partner units 

the cash consideration for these dropdowns in 2017 and 2018 was financed by mplx with 60 billion of debt see “other highlights” section for additional information on mplx debt financing in 2017 and 2018 the equity financing was funded through new mplx common units and general partner units issued to us immediately following the closing of the february 1 2018 dropdown our idrs were cancelled and our economic general partner interest in mplx was converted into a noneconomic general partner interest all in exchange for 275 million newly issued mplx common units which resulted in us owning approximately 64 percent of the issued and outstanding mplx common units as of february 1 2018 these actions were designed to provide a clear valuation of our midstream platform and to provide an ongoing return of capital to our shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on our strategic actions to enhance shareholder value see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 4  for more information on the 2017 dropdowns to mplx and note 26  for more information on the 2018 dropdown to mplx 

acquisitions and investments 

our acquisition and investment activity in 2017 was primarily focused in our midstream segment as follows

our competitive strengths 

extensive integrated platform of midstream retail and refining assets 

we believe the integration of our midstream retail and refining assets distinguishes us from our competitors our midstream retail and refining assets have significant scalewe currently own lease or have ownership interests in approximately 10800  miles of crude oil and products pipelines additionally we have more than 6000 miles of natural gas gathering and ngl pipelines we also own or have ownerships interests in one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the united states as well as trucking and rail assets we operate this transportation and distribution system in coordination with our refining and marketing network which can process up to 19 mmbpcd of crude oil enabling us to optimize raw material supplies and refined product distribution and deliver important economies of scale across our platform our speedway segment discussed further below is one of our largest distribution channels and also our most ratable 

we believe our integrated platform of assets gives us extensive flexibility and optionality to meet the growth needs of the market and the ability to respond promptly to dynamic market conditions including weatherrelated and marketplace disruptions 

competitively positioned marketing operations provide assured product sales 

we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area we have two strong retail brands speedway ®  and marathon ®  we believe speedway llc a whollyowned subsidiary operates the second largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states with approximately 2740   convenience stores in 21  states throughout the midwest east coast and southeast regions of the united states in addition our highly successful speedy rewards ®  customer loyalty program which averaged approximately 6 million  active members in 2017  provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our customer base at existing and new speedway locations the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states comprised of approximately 5600  retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs across 20  states as of december 31 2017  the marathon brand and speedway have been channels for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets 

we consider assured sales as those sales we make to marathon brand customers our speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts our assured sales currently account for approximately 70 of our gasoline production we believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations across our refineries and our transportation and distribution system 

high quality network of strategically located assets 

we believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the midwest and the second largest in the united states based on crude oil refining capacity we own a six plant refinery network with approximately 19  mmbpcd of crude oil throughput capacity our refineries process a wide range of crude oils feedstocks and condensate including heavy and sour crude oils which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates specialty chemicals and other refined products while we have historically processed significant quantities of heavy and sour crude oils our refineries have the ability to process as much as 65 percent to 70 percent light sweet or sour crude oils 

the geographic locations of our refineries provide us with strategic advantages located in padd ii and padd iii which consist of states in the midwest and the gulf coast regions of the united states our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources including domestic canadian and other foreign sources which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs for example geographic proximity to various united states shale oil regions and canadian crude oil supply sources allows our refineries access to priceadvantaged crude oils and lower transportation costs than certain of our refining competitors our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access refined product export markets and to serve a broad range of key enduser markets across the united states quickly and costeffectively 

mplx’s logistics assets are similarly located in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states these regions collectively comprised approximately 75 percent of total united states crude distillation capacity and can serve markets representing approximately 81 percent of total united states finished products demand for the year ended december 31 2017  according to the eia this significantly complements our refining  marketing segment and creates strategic opportunities for mpc mplx is also the largest natural gas processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions which provides it with strategic competitive advantages in capturing and contracting for gathering processing and fractionation of new supplies of natural gas as production in these regions continues to increase mplx also has a growing presence in the southwestern portion of the united states with an existing strong competitive position with ample opportunities for longterm continued organic growth and close proximity to other expansion opportunities as of december 31 2017  mplx’s gathering and processing operations include approximately 59  bcfd of gathering capacity 80  bcfd of natural gas processing capacity and 610  mbpd of fractionation capacity our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas ngls and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets 

our speedway segment which operates in the midwest east coast and southeast complements our refining and midstream assets providing a significant and ratable outlet for our refinery production speedway’s expansion from nine to 21  states since 2013 has also enabled us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation system speedway is a top performer in the convenience store industry with the highest ebitda per store per month of its public peers and leading positions with respect to other comparisons based on light products volume merchandise sales and total margin on a per store per month basis 

 as of december 31 2017   

general partner and sponsor of mplx 

our investment in mplx provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets all with the focus of enhancing our share price through our limited partner interest in mplx mlp interests tend to receive higher market multiples mplx’s liquidity size scale and access to the capital markets should provide us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream business 

following the completion of our strategic actions to enhance shareholder value discussed earlier we own approximately 505 million  mplx common units with a value of 1915 billion  based on mplx’s february 1 2018  closing unit price of 3795  

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 4  for additional information on the dropdowns to mplx 

established track record of profitability 

we have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the business cycle due in large part to our business mix and geographic diversity income generated by our speedway segment is less sensitive to business cycles similarly longterm fee based income generated by our midstream segment is more stable over business cycles while our refining  marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable we also believe our strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results 

strong financial position 

as of december 31 2017  we had 301 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and 425 billion  in unused committed borrowing facilities excluding mplx’s cash and cash equivalents of 5 million  and its credit facilities we had 600 billion  of debt at yearend excluding mplx debt of 695 billion  this combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage provides financial flexibility to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies 

our business strategies 

maintain toptier safety and environmental performance   

we remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continual improvement in our safety record across all of our operations we have a history of safe and reliable operations which was demonstrated again in 2017 with solid personal and process safety performance compared to similar industry averages in addition our corporate headquarters four of our six refineries and 11 additional facilities have earned designations as an osha vpp star site which recognizes employers and workers who have implemented effective safety and health management systems 

we also remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency and reliability of our operations for instance in 2010 we established a “focus on energy” initiative to bolster our commitment to improving the efficiency of our existing installations as part of this initiative a team of dedicated energy specialists was formed to track and communicate nearly 600 individual energy metrics throughout our refining system ensure energy efficiency is designed into proposed capital and expense projects and identify and implement energyefficiency improvements at each of our refineries including multiyear programs to enhance insulation steam system performance and heat integration through this focus our refineries have achieved significant energyefficiency improvements and performance since the epa began recognizing petroleum refineries under its energy star ® program in 2006 we have earned 76 percent of the energy star ®  recognitions despite owning and operating just 10 percent of total us refining capacity we have also implemented similar initiatives in our transportation fleet which has been recognized as an epa smartway ®  partner the smartway program recognizes the bestperforming freight carriers for greenhouse gas and energy efficiency these measures not only reduce emissions but can also reduce operating costs 

we proactively address our regulatory requirements and encourage our operations to continually improve their environmental performance through our dei program which establishes goals and measures performance in 2017 we began to include our natural gas gathering and processing operations in certain aspects of the program even with the additional assets included we maintained our performance from 2016 with 31 dei’s a 53 percent reduction in dei’s since 2013 since 2001 mpc’s health environment safety and security “hess” performance has been continually improving under the responsible care ®  management system and we are now moving into a more rigorous phase of hess management that represents a new level of commitment rc14001 ® 2015 certification rc14001 is a management system that combines responsible care with the globally recognized iso140012015 environmental management system established by the international organization for standardization “iso” iso is an independent nongovernmental international body that provides worldclass specifications for products services and systems that ensure quality safety and efficiency similar to responsible care rc14001 provides the company a management system that integrates health environmental stewardship safety and security and is thirdparty audited to ensure compliance and continual improvement two of our six refineries and our marathon pipeline organization and terminal transport and rail organization are already certified to the rc14001 standard we expect that our remaining refineries will by certified in 2018 and our natural gas gathering and processing operations will begin to seek rc14001 certification in 2019 

grow higher valued stable cash flow businesses 

we intend to continue allocating significant portions of our capital to investments to grow our midstream and retail businesses these businesses typically have more predictable and stable income and cash flows compared to our refining operations and we believe investors assign a higher value to such businesses 

mplx has significantly expanded its midstream activities through mergers and acquisitions dropdown transactions with mpc and organic growth projects mplx will consider organic growth projects that provide attractive returns and cash flows both within its geographic footprint as well as in new regions mplx may pursue these opportunities as standalone projects with mpc or with other parties mplx has identified a number of potential projects over the next several years these primarily include projects to expand gathering processing and fractionation infrastructure in the marcellus and utica regions and infrastructure investments in the permian basin to support significant oil and gas production activities forecasted in those regions 

we intend to continue growing speedway’s profitability by focusing on organic growth opportunities targeted to fill in voids in our existing markets by building new locations and by rebuilding or remodeling existing stores we will also look to expand our presence by opportunistically acquiring high quality stores in new and existing markets we have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market with a continued focus in chicago and tennessee as well as opportunities for growth in new markets including georgia south carolina and upstate new york we also plan to capitalize on diesel demand growth by building out our network of commercial fueling lane locations which cater to local and regional transport fleets within our core market 

focus on longterm integrated relationships with our producer customers 

mplx has developed longterm integrated relationships with its natural gas and ngl producer customers these relationships are characterized by an intense focus on customer service and a deep understanding of producer customers’ requirements coupled with the ability to increase the level of our midstream services in response to their midstream requirements through collaborative planning with these producer customers mplx continues to construct highquality midstream infrastructure and provide unique solutions that are critical to the ongoing success of producer customers’ development plans as a result of these efforts mplx’s markwest subsidiary has been a toprated midstream service provider in customer satisfaction since 2006 as determined by an independent research provider 

pursue margin enhancing investments in refining to deliver top quartile refining performance 

our refining system has the flexibility to process a wide array of crude oils which positions us well to benefit from economically attractive canadian heavy crudes heavysour waterborne cargos as well as the growing crude oil and condensate production from north american shale plays in addition to having access to multiple domestic markets for our refined products we are also well positioned to export distillates and gasoline from our gulf coast refineries 

we intend to enhance margins in our refining  marketing segment by realizing benefits from targeted investments primarily in our gulf coast refining operations over the mid to longterm we believe significant opportunities exist for refiners that can access international markets with their refined products and that can upgrade residual fuel oil into more valuable refined products especially distillates to this end we are investing approximately 15 billion in galveston bay through the star project to create a worldclass refining complex this investment will enable us to upgrade low value residual fuel oil into higher value refined products and lowers the refinery’s cost of production the project scope increases heavy crude processing capacity increases distillate and gas oil recovery and improves the refinery’s overall reliability project implementation began in 2016 and will complete in early 2022 in addition to star we are expanding galveston bay’s waterborne product loading capacity to optimize our gulf coast product supply system we are also investing approximately 200 million in our garyville refinery to increase coking capacity and ulsd production scheduled to complete in 2020 both the galveston bay star and garyville coker expansion projects will allow mpc to capitalize on the expected increase in demand for low sulfur distillate arising from the international maritime organization “imo” low sulfur bunker fuel requirements effective in 2020 additionally garyville will complete the final phase of its diesel max project in early2018 increasing mpc’s ulsd production anticipated to be a key blending component for compliant bunker fuel finally mpc has additional projects under development that would yield benefit through residual fuel oil destruction or increased ulsd production 

sustain focus on disciplined capital allocation and shareholder returns 

we intend to maintain our focus on a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation including return of capital to shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile since becoming a standalone company in june 2011 our dividend has increased by a 265 percent compound annual growth rate and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling 130 billion  through open market purchases and two asr programs we repurchased 246 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 981 billion  representing approximately 35  percent of our outstanding common shares when we became a standalone company in june 2011 we achieved these shareholder returns while also investing in the business and maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile as of december 31 2017  319 billion  of authorization remains available for future share repurchases 

utilize and enhance our high quality employee workforce

refining  marketing 

refineries 

we currently own and operate six  refineries in the gulf coast and midwest regions of the united states with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of 1881 mbpcd during 2017 we merged the management and operations of the galveston bay and texas city refineries into a single worldclass refining complex that is now operated as galveston bay refinery as of december 31 2017 historical refinery data reported for galveston bay will include the former texas city refinery during 2017  our refineries processed 1765 mbpd of crude oil and 179  mbpd of other charge and blendstocks during 2016  our refineries processed 1699  mbpd of crude oil and 151  mbpd of other charge and blendstocks 

our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation fluid catalytic cracking hydrocracking catalytic reforming coking desulfurization and sulfur recovery units the refineries process a wide variety of condensate light and heavy crude oils purchased from various domestic and foreign suppliers we produce numerous refined products ranging from transportation fuels such as reformulated gasolines blendgrade gasolines intended for blending with ethanol and ulsd fuel to heavy fuel oil and asphalt additionally we manufacture aromatics propane propylene and sulfur see the refined product marketing section for further information about the products we produce 

our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations produce higher margin products and efficiently utilize our processing capacity for example naphtha may be moved from galveston bay to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available also shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns allows us to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work 

following is a description of each of our refineries and their capacity 

galveston bay texas city texas refinery  571  mbpcd  our galveston bay refinery is a worldclass refining complex resulting from the combination of our former texas city refinery and galveston bay refinery which we acquired on february 1 2013 the refinery is located on the texas gulf coast approximately 30 miles southeast of houston texas and can process a wide variety of crude oils into gasoline distillates aromatics heavy fuel oil refinerygrade propylene fuelgrade coke dry gas and sulfur the refinery has access to the export market and multiple options to sell refined products our cogeneration facility which supplies the galveston bay refinery currently has 1055  megawatts of electrical production capacity and can produce 43 million  pounds of steam per hour approximately 46 percent  of the power generated in 2017  was used at the refinery with the remaining electricity being sold into the electricity grid 

garyville louisiana refinery  556  mbpcd    our garyville louisiana refinery is located along the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana between new orleans louisiana and baton rouge louisiana the garyville refinery is configured to process a wide variety of crude oils into gasoline distillates fuelgrade coke asphalt polymergrade propylene propane dry gas heavy fuel oil slurry refinerygrade propylene and sulfur the refinery has access to the export market and multiple options to sell refined products a major expansion project was completed in 2009 that increased garyville’s crude oil refining capacity making it one of the largest refineries in the us our garyville refinery has earned designation as an osha vpp star site 

catlettsburg kentucky refinery  277  mbpcd  our catlettsburg kentucky refinery is located in northeastern kentucky on the western bank of the big sandy river near the confluence with the ohio river the catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into gasoline distillates asphalt aromatics heavy fuel oil and propane in the second quarter of 2015 we completed construction of a condensate splitter at our catlettsburg refinery which increased our capacity to process condensate from the utica shale region 

robinson illinois refinery  245   mbpcd  our robinson illinois refinery is located in southeastern illinois the robinson refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into gasoline distillates anodegrade coke propane aromatics slurry and refinerygrade propylene the robinson refinery has earned designation as an osha vpp star site 

detroit michigan refinery  139   mbpcd  our detroit michigan refinery is located in southwest detroit it is the only petroleum refinery currently operating in michigan the detroit refinery processes sweet and heavy sour crude oils into gasoline distillates asphalt fuelgrade coke chemicalgrade propylene propane and slurry our detroit refinery earned designation as an osha vpp star site in the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project that enabled the refinery to process up to an additional 80 mbpd of heavy sour crude oils including canadian crude oils 

canton ohio refinery  93   mbpcd  our canton ohio refinery is located approximately 60 miles south of cleveland ohio the canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils including production from the nearby utica shale into gasoline distillates asphalt roofing flux propane refinerygrade propylene and slurry in december 2014 we completed construction of a condensate splitter at our canton refinery which increased our capacity to process condensate from the utica shale region the canton refinery has earned designation as an osha vpp star site 

as of december 31 2017  our refineries   had 22  rail loading racks and 26  truck loading racks and three  of our refineries had a total of seven  owned and 12  nonowned docks total throughput in 2017  was 99  mbpd for the refinery loading racks and 875  mbpd for the refinery docks 

planned maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional detail 

refined product yields 

the following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years 



crude oil supply 

we obtain the crude oil we refine through negotiated term contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market our term contracts generally have marketrelated pricing provisions the following table provides information on our sources of crude oil for each of the last three years the crude oil sourced outside of north america was acquired from various foreign national oil companies production companies and trading companies 



our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks and distribute our refined products through a variety of channels including pipelines trucks railcars ships and barges 

renewable fuels 

we currently own a biofuel production facility in cincinnati ohio that produces biodiesel glycerin and other byproducts the capacity of the plant is approximately 70 million gallons per year 

we hold ownership interests in ethanol production facilities in albion michigan clymers indiana and greenville ohio these plants have a combined ethanol production capacity of approximately 415  million gallons per year  27  mbpd and are managed by a coowner 

refined product marketing 

we believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our 26 state market area independent retailers wholesale customers our marathon brand jobbers and speedway brand convenience stores airlines transportation companies and utilities comprise the core of our customer base 

the following table sets forth our refined product sales volumes by product group for each of the last three years 



in addition we sell gasoline distillates and asphalt for export primarily out of our garyville and galveston bay refineries the following table sets forth our refined product sales destined for export by product group for the past three years 



gasoline and distillates  we sell gasoline gasoline blendstocks and distillates including no 1 and no 2 fuel oils jet fuel kerosene and diesel fuel to wholesale customers marathonbranded independent entrepreneurs and our speedway ®  convenience stores and on the spot market in addition we sell diesel fuel and gasoline for export to international customers we sold 52  percent of our gasoline sales volumes and 89  percent of our distillates sales volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2017  the demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months 

we have blended ethanol into gasoline for more than 25 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007 in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline were 81  mbpd in 2017  84  mbpd in 2016  and 85  mbpd in 2015  we sell reformulated gasoline which is also blended with ethanol in 12  states in our marketing area we also sell biodieselblended diesel fuel in 17  states in our marketing area the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol and biodiesel blending programs will be driven by market economics and government regulations 

propane  we produce propane at all of our refineries propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and petrochemical consumers 

feedstocks and special products  we are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and special products product availability varies by refinery and includes platformate alkylate fcc unit gas naptha dry gas propylene raffinate butane benzene xylene molten sulfur cumene and toluene we market these products domestically to customers in the chemical agricultural and fuelblending industries in addition we produce fuelgrade coke at our garyville detroit and galveston bay refineries which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications and anodegrade coke at our robinson refinery which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry our feedstocks and special products sales increased to 265  mbpd in 2017 from 231  mbpd in 2016 and decreased in 2016 from 258  mbpd in 2015 the increase in 2017 was primarily due to more feedstocks and special products sold on the spot market as a result of increased product yields the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to more feedstocks used in production versus selling them on the spot market 

heavy fuel oil  we produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components including slurry at all of our refineries heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering fuel industries though there are other more specialized uses of the product 

asphalt  we have refinerybased asphalt production capacity of up to 104  mbpcd which includes asphalt cements polymermodified asphalt emulsified asphalt industrial asphalts and roofing flux we have a broad customer base including asphaltpaving contractors government entities states counties cities and townships and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers we sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail barge and vessel 

the following table sets forth as a percentage of total refined product sales volume the sales of refined products to our different customer types for the past three years 



as of december 31 2017  there were 5617  retail outlets in 20  states and the district of columbia where independent entrepreneurs maintain marathonbranded retail outlets 

terminals 

as of december 31 2017  our refining  marketing segment owned and operated 18  asphalt terminals and two  light products terminals in addition we distribute refined products through 59  light products terminals owned by mplx and approximately 130  thirdparty light products and two  thirdparty asphalt terminals in our market area 

transportation  truck and rail

the locations and detailed information about our refining  marketing assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

speedway 

our speedway segment sells gasoline diesel and merchandise through convenience stores that it owns and operates under the speedway brand speedway convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items speedway’s speedy rewards ®  loyalty program has been a highly successful loyalty program since its inception in 2004 with a consistently growing base which averaged approximately 6 million  active members in 2017  speedway’s ability to capture and analyze memberspecific transactional data enables us to offer speedy rewards ®  members discounts and promotions specific to their buying behavior we believe speedy rewards ®  is a key reason customers choose speedway over competitors and it continues to drive significant value for both speedway and our speedy rewards ®  members 

the demand for gasoline is seasonal with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel 

as of december 31 2017  speedway had 2744  convenience stores in 21  states speedway also owns a 29 percent interest in pfj southeast llc “pfj southeast” which is a joint venture between speedway and pilot flying j with 124 travel center locations primarily in the southeast united states as of december 31 2017

the locations and detailed information about our speedway assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

midstream 

the midstream  segment which primarily includes the operations of mplx gathers processes and transports natural gas gathers transports fractionates stores and markets ngls and transports and stores crude oil and refined products principally for the refining  marketing segment via pipelines terminals towboats and barges the midstream segment also includes certain related operations retained by mpc 

mplx 

as of december 31 2017  mplx assets included approximately 59  bcfd of natural gas gathering capacity 80  bcfd of natural gas processing capacity and 610  mbpd of ngl fractionation capacity 

mplx assets as of december 31 2017  also included 1613  miles of owned or leased and operated common carrier crude oil pipelines and 2360  miles of common carrier products pipelines and partial ownership in 2194  miles of crude oil pipelines and 1917  miles of products pipelines all of which are across 17 states in 2017  third parties generated 16  percent of the crude oil and product shipments on mplx’s common carrier pipelines excluding volumes shipped by mpc under joint tariffs with third parties mplx owns nine butane and propane storage caverns with total capacity of approximately 3 million  barrels 

as of december 31 2017  mplx owned and operated 59  light products terminals and distributes refined products through one  leased light products terminal and two  light products terminals in which it has partial ownership interests but does not operate 

as of december 31 2017  mplx’s marine transportation operations included 18  owned towboats as well as 208  owned and 24  leased barges that transport refined products and crude oil on the ohio mississippi and illinois rivers and their tributaries and intercoastal waterways 

mpcretained midstream assets and investments 

we retained ownership interests in several crude oil and products pipeline systems and pipeline companies we own 228  miles of private products pipelines that are operated by mpl for the benefit of our refining  marketing segment on a cost recovery basis we also have undivided joint interests in 739  miles of common carrier crude oil pipeline systems and partial ownership interests in pipeline companies including 1741  miles of products pipelines

the locations and detailed information about our midstream assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of refined products based upon the “the oil  gas journal 2018  worldwide refinery survey” we ranked second among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity 

we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale spot branded and retail distribution we believe we compete with about 50  companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers about 110  companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market about 10  refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded independent entrepreneurs and approximately 830  retailers in the retail sale of refined products in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and retail consumers we do not produce any of the crude oil we refine 

we also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies independent entrepreneurs and other wellrecognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers often selling gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise at competitive prices nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into sales of retail gasoline and diesel fuel energy analysts international inc estimated such retailers had approximately 15  percent of the us gasoline market in mid 2017  

our midstream  operations face competition for natural gas gathering crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services in obtaining unprocessed ngls for gathering and fractionation and in marketing our products and services competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants operating efficiency and reliability and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of capacity proximity to supply and industry marketing centers and cost efficiency and reliability of service competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and ngls is based primarily on price delivery capabilities flexibility and maintenance of highquality customer relationships in addition certain of our midstream  operations are highly regulated which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined 

products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils wti and lls crude oils and other market structure differentials also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

our midstream  segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and ngls and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year overall our exposure to the seasonal fluctuations in the commodity markets is declining due to our growth in feebased business 

environmental matters 

our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for reviewing our overall environmental performance we also have a corporate emergency response team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review discussion or implementation the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant for additional information see item 1a risk factors we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products additionally we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable 

our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment such laws and regulations include among others the clean air act “caa” with respect to air emissions the clean water act “cwa” with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized 

for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air water solid waste and remediation see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters and compliance costs 

air 

we are subject to many requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations internationally and domestically emphasis has been placed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions there has been a dramatic shift in climaterelated policy under the trump administration as compared to the obama administration’s policies on march 28 2017 president trump published executive order 13783 pledging among other things to review rescind revoke or withdraw much of the obamaera climate change policies regulations and guidance the most prominent policies and regulations impacted by the executive order include the obama administration’s 2013 climate action plan the “clean power plan” the “social cost of carbon” the “social cost of methane” and the council on environmental quality’s “final guidance for federal departments and agencies on consideration of greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of climate change in national environmental policy act reviews” president trump also announced the united states would withdraw from the 2015 paris un climate change conference agreement which aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees celsius as compared to preindustrial levels many of the policies and regulations rescinded through executive order 13783 had been adopted to meet the united states’ pledge under the agreement the us climate change strategy and implementation of that strategy through legislation and regulation may change under future administrations therefore the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time 

regardless of whether legislation or regulation is enacted given the continuing global demand for oil and gas  even under different hypothetical carbonconstrained scenarios  mpc has taken actions that have resulted in lower greenhouse gas emissions and we are positioned to remain a successful company well into the future we have instituted a program to improve energy efficiency of our refineries and other assets which will continue to pay dividends in reducing our environmental 

footprint as well as making us more costcompetitive we believe our mature governance and riskmanagement processes enable the company to effectively monitor and adjust to any transitional or physical climaterelated risks 

in 2009 the epa issued an “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to the endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles the endangerment finding the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act resulted in permitting of greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources through a series of legal challenges filed against the epa the requirement to control greenhouse gas emissions through best available control technology has been limited to new and modified large stationary sources such as refineries that will also emit a criteria pollutant implementing best available control technology may result in increased costs to our operations a few mpc projects may trigger greenhouse gas permitting requirements but any additional capital spending will likely not be significant 

the epa has finalized source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions for new and existing electric utility generating units these standards could impact electric and natural gas rates for all our operations legal challenges have been filed by several states and by industry groups seeking to overturn the final rules in february 2016 the united states supreme court stayed implementation of the standards for existing utility generating units also known as the clean power plan until complete disposition of the litigation the litigation has been placed in abeyance on october 10 2017 the epa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to repeal the clean power plan the epa has also announced its intention to replace the clean power plan with a narrower rule a proposed replacement rule is expected in 2018 

in the   absence of federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions states are becoming more active in regulating greenhouse gas emissions these measures may include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions these measures may also include lowcarbon fuel standards such as the california program or a state carbon tax these measures could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented 

we could also face increased climaterelated litigation with respect to our operations or products private party litigation seeking damages and injunctive relief is pending against mpc and other oil and gas companies in california state court although uncertain these actions could increase our costs or operations or reduce the demand for the refined products we produce transport store and sell 

private parties have also sued federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken in sum requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments these requirements may also significantly affect mpc’s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the extent and magnitude of the impact from greenhouse gas regulation or legislation cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 

in 2015 the epa finalized a revision to the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for ozone the epa lowered the primary ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to 70 ppb this revision initiated a multiyear process in which nonattainment designations will be made based on more recent ozone measurements that includes data from 2016 on november 6 2017 the epa finalized ozone attainmentunclassifiable designations for certain areas under the new standard the epa has not yet designated any counties as nonattainment under the lower primary ozone standard but such nonattainment designations could result in increased costs associated with or result in cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities for areas designated nonattainment states will be required to adopt state implementation plans “sips” for nonattainment areas these sips may include nox andor voc reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities we cannot predict the various sips requirements at this time 

on september 29 2015 the epa signed the final regulations revising existing refinery air emissions standards the revised regulations were published in the federal register on december 1 2015 the revised rule requires additional controls lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring to be implemented over a multiyear period we do not anticipate that mpc’s costs to comply with the revised regulations will be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other things requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances opa90 also requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal 

costs and damages and provides for civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we operate tank vessels and facilities from which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements 

additionally opa90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be doublehulled and that existing tank vessels that are not doublehulled be retrofitted or removed from us service all barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the doublehulled requirements of opa90 some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

in june 2015 the epa and the united states army corps of engineers finalized significant changes to the definition of the term “waters of the united states” “wotus” used in numerous programs under the cwa this final rulemaking is referred to as the clean water rule the clean water rule as written expands permitting planning and reporting obligations and may extend the timing to secure permits for pipeline and fixed asset construction and maintenance activities the clean water rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts by many states trade groups and other interested parties and in october 2015 a united states court of appeals issued a nationwide stay of the clean water rule on appeal however the supreme court determined that the court of appeals did not have original jurisdiction to review challenges to the 2015 rule as such legal challenges to the rule will proceed in federal district courts concurrent with the legal challenges on february 28 2017 president trump signed executive order 13778 directing the epa and the army corps of engineers to review the 2015 rule for consistency with the policy outlined in the order and to issue a proposed rule rescinding or revising the 2015 rule as appropriate and consistent with law the order also directed the agencies to consider interpreting the term ‘‘navigable waters’’ in a manner consistent with justice scalia’s plurality opinion in rapanos v united states 547 us 715 2006 on june 27 2017 the epa and the us army corps of engineers proposed a rule to rescind the clean water rule and recodify the regulatory text that existed prior to 2015 defining waters of the united states then on february 6 2018 the epa and the us army corps of engineers published a final rule adding an applicability date of february 6 2020 to the 2015 clean water rule establishing an applicable date in 2020 will allow the agencies the time needed to reconsider the definition of “waters of the united states” consistent with the executive order 

in 2015 the epa issued its intent to review the cwa categorical effluent limitation guidelines “elg” for the petroleum refining sector during 2017 the epa prepared and issued a draft information request “icr” requesting significant wastewater and treatment process details from select refineries four of which were ours epa may also perform sampling of effluent at one or more of our refineries the epa has indicated they believe there have been significant changes in the characteristics of waste waters generated within refining operations that warrant the review specific targets for the review are the impacts of processing heavier crude oils and the transfer of air pollutants to wastewater when air pollution abatement devices are in use a similar project initiated in 2007 for steam electric power generation with similar attributes resulted in a significant change in the treatment requirements for coalfired power plants however on september 18 2017 epa postponed certain compliance dates while it conducts a rulemaking to revise the elgs for power plants the refining sector elg review has the potential to result in a similar impact the typical lifecycle for an elg review from the intent to review to issuance of a final rule that would require upgrades is seven years the impact of an elg review cannot be accurately estimated at this time 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of usts containing regulated substances we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at our galveston bay and robinson refineries and primarily utilize offsite thirdparty treatment and disposal facilities ongoing rcrarelated costs however are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain convenience stores and other locations where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the applicable state laws and regulations a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

mileage standards renewable fuels and other fuels requirements 

the us congress passed the energy independence and security act of 2007 “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 and contains the rfs2 in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking   by the nhtsa in 2017 the epa announced its intention to reconsider whether the lightduty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards previously established for years 20222025 are appropriate under section 202a of the clean air act and to coordinate its reconsideration with the parallel rulemaking process to be undertaken by the department of transportation’s nhtsa regarding corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for cars and light trucks for the same model years higher cafe standards for cars and light trucks have the potential to reduce demand for our transportation fuels new or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations 

the rfs2 requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 240 billion gallons in 2017 260 billion gallons in 2018 and increase to 360 billion gallons by 2022 within the total volume of renewable fuel eisa established an advanced biofuel volume of 90 billion gallons in 2017 110 billion gallons in 2018 and increasing to 210 billion gallons in 2022 subsets within the advanced biofuel volume include biomassbased diesel which was set as at least 10 billion gallons in 2014 through 2022 to be determined by the epa through rulemaking and cellulosic biofuel which was set at 55 billion gallons in 2017 70 billion gallons in 2018 and increasing to 160 billion gallons in 2022 

on november 30 2015 the epa finalized the renewable fuel standards for the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 as well as the biomassbased diesel standard for 2017 in a legal challenge to the 20142016 volumes the court vacated the total renewable volume for 2016 and remanded to epa for reconsideration consistent with the court’s opinion a remanded rule that increases the 2016 total renewable volume could increase our cost of compliance with the renewable fuels standards and be detrimental to the rin market 

on november 23 2016 the epa finalized the renewable fuel standards for the year 2017 and the biomass based diesel standard for 2018 the epa used its cellulosic waiver authority to reduce the standards for 2017 from the statutory amounts to the following 1928 billion gallons total renewable fuel 428 billion gallons advanced biofuel and 311 million gallons cellulosic ethanol the epa increased the biomass based diesel standard for 2018 to 21 billion gallons the 2017 standards have been challenged in court on november 30 2017 the epa announced the final renewable fuel standards for 2018 and the biomass based diesel standard for 2019 the epa again used its cellulosic waiver authority to reduce the standards for 2018 from the statutory amounts to the following 1929 billion gallons total renewable fuel 429 billion gallons advanced biofuel and 288 million gallons cellulosic ethanol the epa maintained the biomass based diesel standard for 2019 at 21 billion gallons in the near term the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline vehicle regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline “e10” the volumes for 2016 2017 and 2018 result in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the e10 blendwall which will require obligated parties to either sell e15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed historical levels or retire carryover rins in october 2010 the epa issued a partial waiver decision under the caa to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from e10 to e15 for model year 2007 and newer lightduty motor vehicles in january 2011 the epa issued a second waiver for the use of e15 in vehicles model year 20012006 there are numerous issues including state and federal regulatory issues associated with marketing e15 such as infrastructure compatibility issues and vehicle manufacturer warranty concerns related to e15 usage neither e15 nor ethanol flex fuel has been readily accepted by the consumer 

with potentially uncertain supplies the advanced biofuels programs may present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels including biomassbased diesel and cellulosic biofuel 

we made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel rfs2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product and by buying needed biodiesel rins in 

the epacreated biodiesel rins market on april 1 2014 we purchased a facility in cincinnati ohio which currently produces biodiesel glycerin and other byproducts the capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million gallons per year as a producer of biodiesel we now generate rins thereby reducing our reliance on the external rin market 

in november 2017 the epa finalized its decision to deny petitions requesting that the point of obligation for the rfs2 be moved to the terminal rack legal challenge of the epa’s decision is expected and should the court decide that epa’s decision was incorrect and move the point of obligation we could be subject to increased costs and compliance uncertainties 

the rfs2 has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use we may experience a decrease in demand for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced by renewable fuels demand for our refined products also may increase as a result of low carbon fuel standard programs or electric vehicle mandates 

on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm we anticipate that we will spend an estimated 650 million between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards which includes estimated capital expenditures of approximately 400 million in 20182019 

trademarks patents and licenses 

our marathon trademark is material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations and our speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail marketing operations we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole in general we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of knowhow rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations 

employees 

we had approximately 43800  regular fulltime and parttime employees as of december 31 2017  which includes approximately 32150  employees of speedway 

certain hourly employees at our canton catlettsburg and galveston bay refineries are represented by the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that are due to expire in 2019 the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees at our detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is also scheduled to expire in 2019 in addition they represent certain hourly employees at speedway under agreements that cover certain retail locations in new york and new jersey that expire on march 14 2019 and june 30 2019 respectively in addition certain hourly employees at our cincinnati biofuel production facility are represented by the employees representation association under a labor agreement that is due to expire in 2021

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate while others relate to the ownership of our common stock 

our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business 

a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products the measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil or crack spread is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing margins historically refining and marketing margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions any overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing margins many of the factors influencing a change in crack spreads and refining and marketing margins are beyond our control these factors include 

 some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce which may reduce our revenues income from operations and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures impair the carrying value of our assets such as property plant and equipment inventory or goodwill decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages severe weather labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as acts of terrorism for example pipelines provide a nearlyexclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries in such instances a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including but not limited to explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

we rely on the performance of our information technology systems the failure of which due to cybersecurity threats or other risks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems network infrastructure and maintain cloud applications for the effective operation of our business we rely on such systems to process transmit and store electronic information including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee customer investor and payroll data and to manage or support a variety of business processes including our supply chain pipeline operations gathering and processing operations retail sales credit card payments and authorizations at our speedway and marathon branded retail outlets financial transactions banking and numerous other processes and transactions these information systems involve data network and telecommunications internet access and website functionality and various computer hardware equipment and software applications including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business our systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters software viruses or other malware power failures cyberattacks and other events we also face various other cybersecurity threats from criminal hackers statesponsored intrusion industrial espionage and employee malfeasance including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans and continuously provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyberattacks to help ensure we are protected against cyber risks and security breaches while we have invested significant amounts in the protection of our technology systems and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over personally identifiable customer investor and employee data there can be no guarantee such plans to the extent they are in place will be effective certain vendors have access to sensitive information including personally identifiable customer investor and employee data and a breakdown of their technology systems or infrastructure as a result of a cyberattack or otherwise could result in unauthorized disclosure of such information unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or personally identifiable information including by cyberattacks or other security breach could cause loss of data give rise to remediation or other expenses expose us to liability under federal and state laws reduce our customers’ willingness to do business with us disrupt the services we provide to customers and subject us to litigation and investigations which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our applicable insurance may not compensate us adequately for losses that may occur state and federal cybersecurity legislation could also impose new requirements which could increase our cost of doing business 

the retail market is diverse and highly competitive and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business 

we face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices several nontraditional 

retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business these nontraditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow because of their diversity integration of operations experienced management and greater financial resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market in addition these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts adversely affecting our profit margins additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the development availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred 

we have significant debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

at december 31 2017  our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were 134 billion  including 74 billion  of obligations of mplx we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

 a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money andor limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to 750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables in periods of lower prices we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations including those of mplx and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 37 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements certain hourly employees at our canton catlettsburg galveston bay and texas city refineries are represented by the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that are due to expire in 2019 the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees at our detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is also scheduled to expire in 2019 in addition they represent certain hourly employees at speedway under agreements that cover certain retail locations in new york and new jersey that expire on march 14 2019 and june 30 2019 respectively these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us in addition we have experienced or may experience work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership mplx which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if foreign investment in us or mplx exceeds certain levels mplx could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920 which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens among other requirements to establish citizenship entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by us citizens if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws mplx would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although the spinoff occurred in mid2011 certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil however if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is 

responsible we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries whether accruing before on or after the spinoff we also agreed to be responsible for and indemnify marathon oil with respect to all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff or certain internal restructuring transactions failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368a and 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation warranty covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement in addition we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified taxrelated liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities at this time we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts 

also in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions that were required to effect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves the tax liabilities and underlying liabilities in the event marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

significant acquisitions in the future will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows  

significant future transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks which may include among others 

 a significant decrease or delay in oil and natural gas production in mplx’s areas of operation whether due to sustained declines in oil natural gas and ngl prices natural declines in well production or otherwise may adversely affect mplx’s business results of operations and financial condition and could reduce mplx’s ability to make distributions to us 

a significant portion of mplx’s operations are dependent upon production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers which will naturally decline over time which means that mplx’s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of mplx’s facilities mplx must continually obtain new oil natural gas and ngl supplies which depends in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities 

we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of mplx’s operations the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline in addition we have no control over producers or their production decisions which are affected by among other things prevailing and projected energy prices drilling costs per mcf or barrel demand for hydrocarbons operational challenges access to downstream markets the level of reserves geological considerations governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital because of these factors even if new oil or natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by mplx assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves if mplx is not able to obtain new supplies of oil natural gas or ngls to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells throughput on mplx pipelines and the utilization rates of mplx facilities would decline which could have a material adverse effect on mplx’s business results of operations and financial condition and could reduce mplx’s ability to make distributions to us 

decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves the prices for oil natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond our control including global and local demand production levels changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications imports and exports seasonality and weather conditions economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations sustained periods of low prices could result in producers also significantly curtailing or limiting their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil natural gas and ngls to mplx’s facilities and adversely affect mplx’s revenues and cash available for distribution to us this impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of mplx’s commoditybased contracts which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and ngl prices than its feebased contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a btu equivalent basis than ngl products in addition mplx’s purchase and resale of natural gas and ngls in the ordinary course exposes mplx to significant risk of volatility in natural gas or ngl prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of mplx’s production processes also the significant volatility in natural gas ngl and oil prices could adversely impact mplx’s unit price thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital such impacts could adversely impact mplx’s ability to execute its long‑term organic growth projects satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels and may also result in noncash impairments of longlived assets or goodwill or otherthantemporary noncash impairments of our equity method investments 

our recently completed strategic actions designed to enhance shareholder value may not deliver the anticipated benefits 

in january 2017 we announced strategic actions designed to enhance shareholder value including the significant acceleration of dropdowns of midstream assets into mplx and the exchange of our economic interests in the general partner including incentive distribution rights for newly issued mplx common units in conjunction with the completion of such dropdowns on march 1 2017 we contributed certain terminal pipeline and storage assets to mplx and on september 1 2017 we contributed our jointinterest ownership in certain pipelines and storage facilities to mplx on february 1 2018 we completed the dropdown of our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to mplx and the exchange of our economic interests in the general partner including incentive distribution rights for 275 million newly issued mplx common units we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of these actions and the market price of our common stock could decline if securities or industry analysts or our investors disagree with these strategic actions or the way we implement such actions accordingly there is no assurance that these actions will be reflected in the market price of our stock to the extent currently anticipated by management 

significant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies as a result stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to our industry 

changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations which may reduce our refining and marketing margin laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following 

 the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

because the issue of climate change continues to receive scientific and political attention there is the potential for further legislation or regulation that could result in increased operating costs and reduced consumer demand for the traditional transportation fuels we produce transport store and sell greenhouse gas emissions regulations could be implemented such as methods to further reduce methane emissions from our midstream assets a carbon tax or similar effort that increases the cost of our products thereby reducing demand regardless of whether climate change legislation or regulation is enacted given the continuing global demand for oil and gas  even under various hypothetical carbonconstrained scenarios  we believe we effectively budget for prospective costs of climate regulations in our business and strategic planning and our approval of capital project allocations our mature governance and riskmanagement processes enable us to effectively monitor and adjust to physical climaterelated risks at this time however we cannot predict the extent to which any such legislation or regulation will be enacted and if enacted what its impacts upon our operations would be 

we could also face increased climaterelated litigation with respect to our operations or products private party litigation is pending against mpc and other oil and gas companies in california state court although uncertain these types of actions could increase our costs of operations or reduce the demand for the refined products we produce transport store and sell 

in october 2015 the epa reduced the primary health ozone naaqs to 70 ppb from the prior ozone level of 75 ppb on november 6 2017 the epa finalized ozone attainmentunclassifiable designations under the new standard the epa has not yet designated any counties as nonattainment under the lower primary ozone standard but such nonattainment designations could result in increased costs associated with or result in cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities states will also be required to adopt sips for nonattainment areas these sips may include nox andor voc reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities we cannot predict the various sip requirements at this time 

the eisa established increases in fuel mileage standards the department of transportation’s national highway safety administration and the epa work in conjunction to establish cafe standards and greenhouse gas emission standards for lightduty vehicles that become more stringent over time in addition pursuant to a waiver granted by the epa california and other states have enacted laws that require vehicle emission reductions increases in fuel mileage standards and requirements for zero emission vehicles may reduce demand for refined product 

the eisa also expanded the renewable fuel standard “rfs” program administered by the epa governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could pose a competitive threat to our operations the eisa required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 360 billion gallons by 2022 the rfs presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use gasoline consumption has been lower than forecasted by the epa which has led to concerns that the renewable fuel volumes may not be met the 2018 renewable fuel standards were finalized and published on december 12 2017 the final standards are lower than the statutory requirements but nevertheless result in volumes that breach the ethanol “blendwall” the advanced biofuels 

program a subset of the rfs requirements creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations 

tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may further reduce refined product margins the tax incentives and subsidies are causing uncertainties because they have expired and been reinstituted retroactively the biodiesel credit for example expired at the end of 2016 and there is uncertainty if it will be reinstituted 

on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts ppm beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm we anticipate that we will spend an estimated 650 million between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards which includes estimated capital expenditures of approximately 400 million in 20182019 

federal state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could delay or impede producer’s gas production or result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather process and fractionate while we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations we do provide gathering processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result of such operations if federal state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such legal requirements could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase producers’ costs of compliance 

severe weather events may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations 

we have mature systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks such as floods and hurricaneforce winds and potential chronic physical risks such as higher ocean levels if any such events were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations specifically where appropriate we are hardening and modernizing assets against flood and wind damage and ensuring we have resiliency measures in place such as stormspecific readiness plans we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to protect our assets and operations from such physical risks and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks to the extent such severe weather events increase in frequency and severity we may be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies 

our anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets however policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups one of the ways we may grow our business is through the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing ones the construction of a new pipeline or the expansion of an existing pipeline by adding horsepower or pump stations or by adding a second pipeline along an existing pipeline involves numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties most of which are beyond our control the approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines and negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry these projects may not be completed on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost in addition our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project for instance if we build a new pipeline the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making 

required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing margins 

the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies production companies and trading companies including suppliers from canada the middle east and various other international locations the market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market we are therefore subject to the attendant political geographic and economic risks of such a market if one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our operations sales of refined products and refining and marketing margins could be adversely affected materially and adversely impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products ngls and natural gas additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult andor costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability for example the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products ngls natural gas or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use payroll franchise withholding and property taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties 

terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

the us government has issued warnings that energy assets in general including the nation’s refining pipeline and terminal infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations the threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks any future terrorist attacks on our facilities those of our customers and in some cases those of other pipelines 

could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 

 we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are the subject of or a party to a number of pending or threatened legal actions contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters including laws and regulations relating to the environment some of these matters are discussed below 

litigation 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty while it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

mplx markwest markwest liberty midstream markwest liberty bluestone llc ohio fractionation and markwest utica emg collectively the “mplx parties” are parties to various lawsuits with bilfinger westcon inc “westcon” that were instituted in 2016 and 2017 in the court of common pleas in butler county pennsylvania the circuit court in wetzel county west virginia and the court of common pleas in harrison county ohio the lawsuits relate to disputes regarding construction work performed by westcon at the bluestone mobley and cadiz processing complexes in pennsylvania west virginia and ohio respectively and the hopedale fractionation complex in ohio with respect to work performed by westcon at the mobley and bluestone processing complexes one or more of the mplx parties have asserted breach of contract fraud and with respect to work performed at the mobley processing complex markwest liberty midstream has also asserted negligent misrepresentation claims against westcon weston has also asserted claims against one or more of the mplx parties regarding these construction projects for breach of contract unjust enrichment promissory estoppel fraud and constructive fraud tortious interference with contractual relations and civil conspiracy the mplx parties seek in excess of 10 million plus an unspecified amount of punitive damages westcon seeks in excess of 40 million plus an unspecified amount of punitive damages while the ultimate outcome and impact cannot be predicted with certainty and management is not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of loss if any for these claims we believe the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2015 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against our whollyowned subsidiary marathon petroleum company lp “mpc lp” in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky asserting claims under federal and state antitrust statutes the kentucky consumer protection act and state common law the complaint as amended in july 2015 alleges that mpc lp used deed restrictions supply agreements with customers and exchange agreements with competitors to unreasonably restrain trade in areas within kentucky and seeks declaratory relief unspecified damages civil penalties restitution and disgorgement of profits at this stage the ultimate outcome of this litigation remains uncertain and neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability if any can be determined and we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss for this matter we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 

in may 2007 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against us and marathon oil in state court in franklin county kentucky for alleged violations of kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws following hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 the lawsuit alleges that we overcharged customers by 89 million during september and october 2005 the complaint seeks disgorgement of these sums as well as penalties under kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws we are vigorously defending this litigation we believe that this is the first lawsuit for damages and injunctive relief under the kentucky emergency pricing laws to progress this far and it contains many novel issues in may 2011 the kentucky attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in april and may 2011 under statewide price controls that were activated by the kentucky governor on april 26 2011 and which have since expired the court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief and the remainder of the 2011 claims likely will be resolved along with those dating from 2005 if the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably in its entirety it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse effect 

environmental proceedings 

the illinois environmental protection agency “iepa” initiated an enforcement action against marathon pipe line llc a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx “mpl” in connection with an april 17 2016 pipeline release to the wabash river near crawleyville indiana mpl responded to a clean water act request for information from the epa in furtherance of its investigation of possible violations arising from the april 17 2016 pipeline release mpl has entered into joint settlement negotiations with the iepa and the epa and reached a settlement in principle for payment of a total civil penalty of 335000 

on december 22 2017 we entered into a settlement with the ohio environmental protection agency in connection with alleged violations of the clean air act at our canton ohio refinery in accordance with the settlement we paid a penalty of 250000 

in july 2015 representatives from the epa and the united states department of justice conducted a search at a markwest liberty midstream pipeline launcherreceiver site utilized for pipeline maintenance operations in washington county pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant the criminal investigation ended without any charges against markwest liberty midstream with respect to the civil enforcement allegations associated with permitting or other related regulatory obligations for its launcherreceiver and compressor station facilities in the region markwest liberty midstream and its affiliates have agreed in principle to pay a cash penalty of approximately 06 million and to undertake certain supplemental environmental projects with an estimated cost of approximately 24 million 

we are involved in a number of other environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business while the ultimate outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

corporate overview 

we are an independent petroleum refining and marketing retail and midstream company overall we are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining marketing retail and transportation businesses in the united states and the largest east of the mississippi 

we currently own and operate six  refineries all located in the united states with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 19  mmbpcd our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas including the midwest northeast east coast southeast and gulf coast regions of the united states we distribute refined products to our customers through pipeline and marine transportation terminals and storage services provided by our midstream segment we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area 

we have two strong retail brands speedway ®  and marathon ®  we believe that speedway llc a whollyowned subsidiary operates the second largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states with approximately 2740  convenience stores in 21  states throughout the midwest east coast and southeast the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states and is available through approximately 5600  retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 20  states and the district of columbia 

through our ownership interests in mplx we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the united states and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and ngls from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets our midstream gathering and processing operations include natural gas gathering processing and transportation and ngl gathering transportation fractionation storage and marketing our assets include approximately 59  bcfd of gathering capacity 80  bcfd of natural gas processing capacity and 610  mbpd of fractionation capacity as of december 31 2017  as of december 31 2017  we owned leased or had ownership interests in approximately 10800  miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas we distribute our refined products through one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges 

in the first quarter of 2017 we revised our segment reporting in connection with the contribution of certain terminal pipeline and storage assets to mplx the operating results for these assets are now reported in our midstream segment previously they were reported as part of our refining  marketing segment comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised presentation the results for the pipeline and storage assets were recast effective january 1 2015 and the results for the terminal assets were recast effective april 1 2016 prior to these dates these assets were not considered businesses for accounting purposes and therefore there are no financial results from which to recast segment results 

our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing speedway and midstream each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer see item 1 business for additional information on our segments 



 strategic actions to enhance shareholder value 

on january 3 2017 we announced plans to significantly accelerate the dropdown of assets with an estimated 14 billion of mlpeligible annual ebitda to mplx and to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of mplx including idrs for newly issued mplx common units in 2017 in connection with these plans we contributed assets to mplx with projected annual ebitda of approximately 400 million for 193 billion of cash and approximately 31 million  mplx common units and general partner units see “mplx lp  mplx highlights” for information on these dropdowns on february 1 2018 we completed the dropdown of the remaining identified assets which included our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services with projected annual ebitda of approximately 1 billion in exchange for 41 billion of cash and 114 million mplx common units and general partner units 

the cash consideration for these dropdowns in 2017 and 2018 was financed by mplx with 60 billion of debt see “mplx highlights” section for additional information on mplx debt financing in 2017 and 2018 the equity financing was funded through new mplx common units and general partner units issued to us immediately following the closing of the february 1 2018 dropdown our idrs were cancelled and our economic general partner interest was converted into a noneconomic general partner interest all in exchange for 275 million newly issued mplx common units which resulted in us owning approximately 64 percent of the issued and outstanding mplx common units as of february 1 2018 these actions were designed to provide a clear valuation of our midstream platform and to provide an ongoing return of capital to our shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile 

our january 3 2017 announcement included conducting a full and thorough review of speedway to ensure optimum value is being delivered to shareholders over the long term on september 5 2017 we announced that our board of directors based on a recommendation from its independent special committee determined that maintaining speedway as a fully integrated business with mpc provides the best opportunity for enhancing longterm shareholder value key factors in the board of directors’ decision to maintain speedway as an integrated business within mpc included substantial integration synergies support of mpc’s investmentgrade credit profile and ability to return capital to shareholders and the strong value of cash flow diversification 

executive summary 

results 

select results for 2017  and 2016  are reflected in the following table 



net income attributable to mpc increased   226 billion  or 449  per diluted share in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to an income tax benefit of approximately 15 billion resulting from the tcja and improved results from our refining  marketing segment 

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased  in 2017  compared to 2016  excluding the 345 million lcm inventory benefit recognized in 2016 the increase in segment results for 2017 primarily resulted from higher lls crack spreads in both the us gulf coast and chicago markets the lls blended crack spread for 2017 increased to 984  per barrel from 696  per barrel in 2016 these favorable effects were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared to the spot market prices used in the lls blended crack spread 

excluding the 25 million lcm inventory benefit recognized in 2016 the increase in speedway segment results for 2017 was primarily due to contributions from its travel center joint venture formed in the fourth quarter of 2016 and lower operating expense partially offset by lower merchandise margin and lower gains from asset sales 

midstream  segment income from operations increased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher natural gas and ngl gathering processing and fractionating volumes and changes in natural gas and ngl prices segment results also benefited from the first quarter 2017 acquisitions of the ozark pipeline and our ownership interest in the bakken pipeline system 

items not allocated in 2017 includes an 86 million litigation charge a litigation benefit of 57 million 52 million of pension settlement expenses and a benefit of 23 million related to mpc’s share of gains from the sale of assets remaining from the canceled sandpiper pipeline project items not allocated to segments in 2016 includes noncash impairment charges totaling 486 million which included 267 million related to our equity method investment in the sandpiper pipeline project resulting from the indefinite deferral of this project 130 million related to the goodwill recognized in connection with the markwest merger and 89 million related to an mplx equity method investment 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 the tcja significantly revised us corporate income tax law by among other things reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent earnings for 2017 includes a tax benefit of approximately 15 billion as a result of remeasuring certain net deferred tax liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate 

noncontrolling interests increased in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to increased mplx net income 

mplx lp 

mplx is a diversified growthoriented publicly traded master limited partnership originally formed by us to own operate develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets mplx is engaged in the gathering processing and transportation of natural gas the gathering transportation fractionation storage and marketing of ngls and the gathering transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products on december 4 2015 we completed the markwest merger whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx 

as of december 31 2017  we owned a 304 percent  interest in mplx including a two percent  general partner interest mplx is a vie because the limited partners of mplx do not have substantive kickout or substantive participating rights over the general partner we are the primary beneficiary of mplx because in addition to significant economic interest we also have the power through our 100 percent  ownership of the general partner to control the decisions that most significantly impact mplx we therefore consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 696 percent  interest owned by the public the creditors of mplx do not have recourse to mpc’s general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements the assets of mplx are the property of mplx and cannot be used to satisfy the obligations of mpc mpc has effectively guaranteed certain indebtedness of loop and locap in which mplx holds an interest see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25  for more information

 distributions from mplx 

the following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from mplx during 2017  and 2016  



as discussed in the “strategic actions to enhance shareholder value” section above we believe there is substantial value in our economic interests in the general partner of mplx and exchanged these economic interests for 275 million newly issued mplx common units in conjunction with the completion of our dropdowns to highlight that value after giving effect to the dropdown of certain assets and idr exchange on february 1 2018 we owned approximately 505 million  mplx common units valued at 1915 billion  based on the february 1 2018  closing unit price of 3795  

on january 26 2018 mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of 06075 per common unit which was payable february 14 2018 as a result mplx made distributions totaling 346 million to its limited and general partners mpc’s portion of this distribution was approximately 170 million

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining  marketing margin and refinery throughputs our total refining capacity was 1881  mbpcd 1817  mbpcd and 1794  mbpcd as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

our refining  marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants we calculate midwest chicago and usgc crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products lls prices and a 6321 ratio of products 6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline 2 barrels of ultralow sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil are used for these crackspread calculations 

our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil the amount of this discount the sweetsour differential can vary significantly causing our refining  marketing margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil in general a larger sweetsour differential will enhance our refining  marketing margin 

future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors as well as us energy policy 

the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions   

 in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sweetsour differential and the lls to wti differential our refining  marketing margin is impacted by factors such as 



 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market costs of crude oil refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values at december 31 2017  market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

refining  marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs which include turnaround and major maintenance depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs planned major maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years 



speedway 

our retail marketing margin for gasoline and distillate which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees impacts the speedway segment profitability gasoline and distillate prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply and demand in padd 1 and padd 2 where we operate numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year including local competition seasonal demand fluctuations the available wholesale supply the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions the following padd 1 and padd 2 market demands for 2017 are based on current estimates padd 2 2017 gasoline demand grew for the fifth consecutive year up 05 percent from last year’s record level padd 1 gasoline demand posted an annual gain in 2017 for the fourth consecutive year up 09 percent year over year continuing economic growth and slowing fleet fuel efficiency gains supported gasoline demand in most of the us distillate demand in 2017 posted its first yearoveryear increase in three years up 19 percent from 2016 increases in truck tonnage which grew by 38 percent the largest annual increase since 2013 and rail traffic total carloads and intermodal supported a 34 percent increase in 2017 distillate demand over 2016’s six year low padd 1 2017 distillate demand was up 08 percent from its four year low in 2016 padd 2 2017 distillate demand is up 28 percent year over year the margin on merchandise sold at our convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to speedway’s margin more than half of speedway’s margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2017  speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items 

inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value costs of refined products and merchandise are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values as of december 31 2017  market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

midstream   

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling volumes by our producer customers such prices also affect midstream segment profitability 

the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations included in our midstream segment primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining  marketing segment the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

results of operations 

the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  this discussion should be read in conjunction with item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 

consolidated results of operations 



net income attributable to mpc increased   226 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased 168 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017  was primarily due to a tax benefit of 15 billion resulting from the tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase in our refining  marketing segment income from operations of 964 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  the decrease in 2016  was primarily due to a decrease in our refining  marketing segment income from operations of 264 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  partially offset by increases in our midstream and speedway segment results income from operations for 2016 includes a noncash benefit of 370 million related to the reversal of the company’s lcm inventory valuation reserve and impairment charges of 356 million related to equity method investments and 130 million related to goodwill see segment results for additional information 

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes increased   1083 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased 877 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher averaged refined product sales prices which increased 025  per gallon and an increase in refined product sales volumes which increased   42  mbpd the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices which decreased 027 per gallon and lower sales volumes which decreased 32 mbpd 

sales to related parties increased   567 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  mainly due to sales from our refining  marketing segment to pfj southeast a joint venture with pilot flying j which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 

income loss from equity method investments increased   491 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased 273 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017 was primarily due to the absence of impairment charges related to equity method investments of 356 million recorded in 2016 along with increases in income from new and existing pipeline natural gas retail and marine affiliates the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the 356 million of impairment charges partially offset by increases in income from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments 

net gain on disposal of assets decreased   22 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased 25 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to gains on the sale of certain speedway locations in 2016 

other income increased   142 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased 66 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased rin sales the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of markwest other income and increased rin sales 

cost of revenues increased   959 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased 641 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017  was primarily due to an increase in refined product cost of sales of 918 billion primarily attributable to an increase in our average crude oil costs of 950 per barrel the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in refined product cost of sales of 652 billion primarily attributable to a decrease in our average crude oil costs of 726 per barrel partially offset by an increase in refinery direct operating costs of 407 million or 072 per barrel of total refinery throughput which reflects significantly higher turnaround activity in 2016 as compared to a lower than normal level of turnaround costs in 2015 

purchases from related parties increased   61 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased 201 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017  was primarily due to 

 the increase in purchases from related parties in 2016  was primarily due to 

 inventory market valuation adjustment decreased costs and expenses by 740 million in 2016  compared to 2015  the lcm inventory reserve recorded in 2015 of 370 million was reversed in 2016 due to increases in refined product prices during the second quarter of 2016 resulting in reductions to cost of revenues of 370 million in 2016 

impairment expense decreased   130 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased 14 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  impairment expense in 2016 reflects a 130 million charge recorded by mplx to impair a portion of the 221 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger in 2015 an impairment charge of 144 million was recorded related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery impairments related to equity method investments were recorded to income loss from equity method investments and discussed above 

depreciation and amortization increased 499 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the markwest merger in december 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses increased   138 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased 29 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017 was primarily due a 45 million increase in pension settlement expenses increases in employeerelated compensation and benefit expenses higher corporate costs and net litigation settlement expenses of 29 million the increase in 2016 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of markwest expenses largely offset by decreases in contract services and other corporate costs 

other taxes increased 44 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the inclusion of markwest’s taxes 

net interest and other financial costs increased   69 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased 238 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017 reflects the mplx senior notes issued in february 2017 partially offset by decreased borrowings on the mpc term loan agreement the increase in 2016 was primarily due to interest on the debt assumed in the markwest merger we capitalized interest of 55 million  in 2017  63 million  in 2016  and 37 million  in 2015  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for further details 

provision for income taxes decreased   107 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased 897 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the tcja was signed into law on december 22 2017 and provided several key changes to us tax law including a federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent  replacing the current rate applicable to mpc of 35 percent  mpc was required to calculate the effect of the tcja on its deferred tax balances as of the enactment date the effect of the federal corporate income tax rate change reduced net deferred tax liabilities by 15 billion  in 2017 this benefit was partially offset by an increase in our income before income taxes which increased   152 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  the decrease in 2016  was primarily due to a decrease in our income before income taxes of 255 billion  compared to 2015  the tcja impacted our effective tax rate by 45  percentage points in 2017  decreasing our effective tax rate from 31 percent to 14 percent  the effective tax rate excluding the tcja of 31 percent in 2017  and the effective tax rates of 33 percent  and 34 percent  in 2016  and 2015  respectively are slightly less than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences including the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12  for further details

nongaap financial measures 

management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with gaap “nongaap” we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to its most comparable gaap financial measure they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the nongaap financial measures we use are as follows 

refining  marketing margin 

refining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes the lcm inventory market adjustment 

speedway gasoline and distillate margin 

speedway gasoline and distillate margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees and excluding any lcm inventory market adjustment 

speedway merchandise margin 

speedway merchandise margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of merchandise 

see the reconciliations of these nongaap measures in the following segment discussions 

refining  marketing 



 



the following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business 



the following table includes the impacts of changes in the market indicators above on refining  marketing segment results 



 refining  marketing segment revenues increased   1087 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased 1038 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher refined product sales prices and volumes the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices and volumes 

refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment increased   720 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased   144 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in average refined product sales prices partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in average refined product sales prices partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes 

refining  marketing intersegment fees paid to our midstream segment increased   181 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and 332 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  due the dropdown of certain assets to mplx certain segment information has been recast to reflect this activity as noted in the “corporate overview” section after the february 1 2018 dropdown of assets to mplx as noted in the “corporate overview  strategic actions to enhance shareholder value” section refining  marketing intersegment fees paid to mplx will increase for fuels distribution services and refinery logistics assets and refining  marketing direct operating costs will decrease these changes will not impact refining  marketing margin but will reduce refining  marketing segment results there will be a corresponding increase in the midstream segment results 

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased   964 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased   264 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  segment income in 2016 includes a 345 million noncash benefit related to the company’s lcm inventory reserve excluding the lcm inventory benefit the increase in segment results for 2017 primarily resulted from higher lls crack spreads in both the us gulf coast and chicago markets the lls blended crack spread for 2017 increased to 984  per barrel from 696  per barrel in 2016 these favorable effects were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared to the spot market prices used in the lls blended crack spread segment income in 2015 includes a 

345 million noncash charge related to the company’s lcm inventory reserve which was reversed in 2016 the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance was more than offset by the unfavorable effects of lower crack spreads and higher direct operating costs due to refinery turnarounds 

based on changes in the market indicators shown above and our refinery throughputs we estimate a positive impact of 233 billion  for 2017  compared to 2016  and a negative impact of 190 billion  for 2016  compared to 2015  on refining  marketing segment income from operations the market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales differences in our results compared to these market indicators including product price realizations the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of lcm inventory valuation adjustments the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances had estimated negative  impacts on refining  marketing segment income from operations of 135 billion in 2017  compared to 2016  and 304 million in 2016  compared to 2015  the significant elements of the negative impact in both years were unfavorable product price realizations and unfavorable crude acquisition costs relative to the market indicators in 2016 these negative impacts were partially offset by the reversal of the company’s lcm inventory valuation reserve that was recorded in 2015 

the cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the lifo method in the second quarter of 2016 we had recognized the effects of an interim liquidation of our refined products inventories which we did not expect to reinstate by year end resulting in a pretax charge of approximately 54 million to income based on year end refined product inventories which were higher than inventories at the beginning of the year we had a build in refined product inventories for 2016 therefore we recognized the effects of this annual build in our refined products in the fourth quarter of 2016 which had the effect of reversing the second quarter charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a lifo charge of 45 million as a result of annual decreased levels in refined products and crude inventory volumes for the full year we recognized a lifo charge of 7 million  in 2017 2 million in 2016 and 78 million in 2015 

refinery direct operating costs decreased   017  per barrel in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased 072 per barrel in 2016  compared to 2015  the decrease in 2017 includes an 011 per barrel decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs resulting from lower turnaround activity at our garyville and robinson refineries partially offset by higher activity at our catlettsburg refinery the change in 2016 compared to 2015 includes an increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of 070 per barrel as well as a decrease in other manufacturing costs of 006 per barrel the increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2016 are primarily attributable to higher turnaround activity at the galveston bay garyville and robinson refineries and a lower than normal schedule of turnaround activity in 2015 partially offset by a decrease in turnaround activity at the catlettsburg refinery in 2016 the decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily due to lower routine maintenance costs general and administrative expenses and waste costs 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 457 million in 2017  288 million in 2016  and 212 million in 2015  the increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher weighted average rin costs driven by higher market prices for purchased rins and increases in the number of rins purchased in 2015 we recorded a 46 million charge to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance based on the renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015 proposed by the epa in may 2015 and finalized in november 2015 particularly those for biomassbased diesel and advanced biofuels excluding this charge the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the effect of increased purchases of biomassbased diesel rins at increased prices 

speedway 



 

 speedway segment revenues increased   747 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased   141 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017 was due to an increase  in gasoline and distillate sales of 860 million  partially offset by a decrease  in merchandise sales of 114 million  average gasoline and distillate selling prices increased 025 per gallon which were partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes in 2017  compared to 2016  the decreases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and merchandise sales are primarily attributable to the contribution of 41 travel centers to pjf southeast in fourth quarter of 2016 the decrease in 2016 was due to a decrease in gasoline and distillate sales of 152 billion primarily due to a decrease in gasoline and distillate selling prices of 027 per gallon 

speedway segment income from operations decreased   2 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased 61 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  segment income in 2016 includes a 25 million noncash benefit related to the reversal of the company’s lcm inventory reserve which was recorded in 2015 excluding the lcm inventory benefit recognized in 2016 the increase in segment results for 2017 was primarily due to a full year of contributions from speedway’s travel center joint venture formed 

in the fourth quarter 2016 and lower operating expense partially offset by lower merchandise margin and lower gains from asset sales in 2016 in addition to the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance the remaining increase during 2016 was primarily due to higher merchandise margin of 67 million  and gains from asset sales partially offset by lower gasoline and distillate margin of 91 million or 00167 per gallon the increase in merchandise margin in 2016 was related to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins 

midstream 



 midstream  segment revenue and income from operations increased   675 million  and 291 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  respectively and 197 billion  and 585 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  respectively the increases in 2017 were primarily due to increased revenue from higher natural gas and ngl gathering processing and fractionation volumes and changes in natural gas and ngl prices segment results also benefited from the first quarter 2017 acquisitions of the ozark pipeline and our ownership interest in the bakken pipeline system the comparison for 2017 and 2016 also reflects the absence of any revenues for the terminal services provided to the refining  marketing segment in the first quarter of 2016 versus the inclusion of revenues for these services in the first quarter of 2017 these assets were not considered a business prior to april 1 2016 and therefore no financial results for these assets were available from which to recast first quarter 2016 midstream segment results the increases in 2016 were primarily due to the inclusion of markwest’s operating results in midstream segment income following the merger with mplx from the december 4 2015 merger date midstream income from operations also increased due to earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments 

after the february 1 2018 dropdown of assets to mplx as noted in the “corporate overview  strategic actions to enhance shareholder value” section intersegment sales to our refining  marketing segment will increase for fees charged for fuels distribution services and refinery logistics assets

 corporate and other unallocated expenses increased   97 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased   25 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2017 is largely due to higher unallocated corporate costs and increases in employeerelated expenses and corporate costs the decrease in 2016 is primarily due to increased allocations of corporate costs to the segments 

other unallocated items in 2017 include an 86 million litigation charge a litigation benefit of 57 million and a benefit of 23 million related to mpc’s share of gains from the sale of assets remaining from the canceled sandpiper pipeline project other unallocated items in 2016 include impairment charges of 486 million resulting from noncash charges of 267 million related to the indefinite deferral of the sandpiper pipeline project 130 million related to the goodwill recognized in connection with the markwest merger and 89 million related to an mplx equity method investment other unallocated items in 2015 include an impairment charge of 144 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for additional information on the impairment charges 

we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of 52 million  in 2017  7 million  in 2016  and 4 million  in 2015  from the recognition of certain deferred pension plan losses in connection with significant settlements of our pension obligations during these years 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 301 billion  at december 31 2017  compared to 887 million  at december 31 2016  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table 



net cash provided by operating activities increased   261 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to increased operating results and favorable changes in working capital of 174 billion  compared to 2016  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 78 million in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to decreased operating results partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of 122 billion compared to 2015 the above changes in working capital exclude changes in shortterm debt 

for 2017  changes in working capital were a net 194 billion  source of cash primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in inventories partially offset by an increase in current receivables changes from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  per the consolidated balance sheets excluding the impact of acquisitions were as follows 



 for 2016 changes in working capital were a net 200 million source of cash primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventories accounts payable increased 850 million from yearend 2015 primarily due to higher crude oil payable prices current receivables increased 690 million from yearend 2015 primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil receivable prices and inventories increased 61 million from yearend 2015 excluding the change in the company’s inventory valuation reserve of 370 million primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product inventory volumes 

for 2015 changes in working capital were a net 102 billion use of cash primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventories accounts payable decreased 192 billion from yearend 2014 primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices and volumes current receivables decreased 113 billion from yearend 2014 primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices and lower crude oil receivable volumes and inventories decreased 47 million from yearend 2014 excluding a 370 million lcm inventory valuation charge primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil inventory volumes 

cash flows used in investing activities increased   453 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  and decreased 500 million in 2016  compared to 2015  

 the consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash a reconciliation of additions to property plant and equipment to total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years 



 financing activities were uses of cash of 109 billion  in 2017  129 billion  in 2016  and 999 million  in 2015  



under the mpc term loan agreement during 2016 mplx used proceeds from its issuance of the mplx preferred units to repay amounts outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility and mpc chose to prepay 500 million under its term loan see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for additional information on our longterm debt 

 derivative instruments 

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk 

capital resources 

our liquidity totaled 73 billion  at december 31 2017  consisting of 



 because of the alternatives available to us including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets including a commercial paper program we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm and longterm funding requirements including capital spending programs the repurchase of shares of our common stock dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies 

as discussed in the “strategic actions to enhance shareholder value” section in the corporate overview mplx financed the dropdown transactions in the aggregate with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions the equity financing was funded through mplx common units and general partner units issued to us these actions were designed to provide a clear valuation of our midstream platform and to provide an ongoing return of capital to shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile in connection with the final dropdown on january 2 2018 mplx entered into a 41 billion 364day termloan facility to fund the cash portion of the dropdown consideration 

on february 8 2018 mplx issued 55 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering consisting of 500 million  aggregate principal amount of 3375 percent  unsecured senior notes due march 2023 125 billion  aggregate principal amount of 4000 percent  unsecured senior notes due march 2028 175 billion  aggregate principal amount of 4500 percent  unsecured senior notes due april 2038 15 billion  aggregate principal amount of 4700 percent  unsecured senior notes due april 2048 and 500 million  aggregate principal amount of 4900 percent  unsecured senior notes due april 2058 

on february 8 2018 41 billion  of the net proceeds were used to repay the 364day termloan facility which was drawn on february 1 2018 to fund the cash portion of the consideration mplx paid mpc for the dropdown of assets on february 1 

2018 the remaining proceeds will be used to repay outstanding borrowings under mplx’s revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with us and for general partnership purposes 

commercial paper  – we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of 2 billion  in commercial paper outstanding with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities at december 31 2017  we had no  amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program 

mpc bank revolving credit facility  – on july 21 2017 we entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of lenders to replace our previous 25 billion   four year revolving credit facility due in 2020 and our previous 1 billion   364 day credit agreement dated as of july 20 2016 which expired on july 19 2017 the new agreements provide for a five year 25 billion  bank revolving credit agreement “mpc fiveyear credit agreement” maturing on july 21 2022 and a 364 day 1 billion  bank revolving credit agreement “mpc 364day credit agreement” and together with the mpc fiveyear credit agreement the “mpc credit agreements” maturing on july 20 2018  there were no  borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under these facilities at december 31 2017  

trade receivables facility  – our trade receivables facility has a borrowing capacity of 750 million  depending on the amount of our eligible domestic trade accounts receivable and a maturity date of july 19 2019  as of december 31 2017  eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of 750 million  there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31 2017  availability under our trade receivables facility is primarily a function of refined product selling prices 

mplx credit agreement  – on july 21 2017 mplx entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace the existing 2 billion   five year bank revolving credit facility with a 225 billion   five year bank revolving credit facility with a maturity date of july 21 2022  “mplx credit agreement” at december 31 2017  mplx had 505 million  borrowings and 3 million  of letters of credit outstanding under the bank revolving credit facility resulting in total unused loan availability of approximately 174 billion  

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for further discussion of our debt 

the mpc credit agreements contain representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types the financial covenant included in the mpc credit agreements requires us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization as defined in the mpc credit agreements of no greater than 065 to 100 other covenants restrict us andor certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 020  to 100 as well as the other covenants contained in the mpc credit agreements 

the mplx credit agreement contains certain representations and warranties affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type the mplx credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the mplx credit agreement for the prior four  fiscal quarters of no greater than 50  to 10 or 55  to 10 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period other covenants restrict mplx andor certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2017  mplx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement including a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 323  to 10 

as disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3  to our audited consolidated financial statements we expect the adoption of the lease accounting standard update to result in the recognition of a significant lease obligation the mpc bank revolving credit facility and the mplx credit agreement both contain provisions under which the effects of the new accounting standard are not recognized for purposes of financial covenant calculations 

our intention is to maintain an investmentgrade credit profile as of january 31 2018 the credit ratings on our and mplx’s senior unsecured debt were at or above investmentgrade level as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investmentgrade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

none of the mpc credit agreements the mplx credit agreement or our trade receivables facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt would increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under the revolving credit facility and our trade receivables facility in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investmentgrade levels could under certain circumstances decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements 

capital requirements 

for information about our capital expenditures and investments see the “capital spending” section 

during the second quarter of 2017 we paid bp 131 million  for the fourth year’s contingent earnout related to our 2013 acquisition of the galveston bay refinery this second quarter payment represents the final payment under the agreement see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  – note 17  

in 2017  we made pension contributions totaling 128 million  we have no required funding for 2018  but may make voluntary contributions at our discretion 

on january 29 2018  we announced our board of directors approved a 046  per share dividend payable march 12 2018  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 21 2018  

on february 5 2018 we announced our intent to redeem all of the 600 million  outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2700 percent senior notes due on december 14 2018 the 2018 senior notes will be redeemed from available cash on march 15 2018 at a price equal to par plus a make whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest the make whole premium will be calculated based on the market yield of the applicable treasury issue as of the redemption date as determined in accordance with the indenture governing the 2018 senior notes based on current treasury yields we expect the make whole premium on the 2018 senior notes excluding accrued and unpaid interest to be less than 30 million  or 050 percent  of the face value of the notes 

we may from time to time repurchase notes in the open market in privatelynegotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate 

share repurchases 

since january 1 2012 our board of directors has approved 130 billion  in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of 981 billion  of our common stock leaving 319 billion  available for repurchases as of december 31 2017  under these authorizations we have acquired 246 million  shares at an average cost per share of 3982  as part of our strategic actions to enhance shareholder value for the year ended december 31 2017  cash proceeds received from dropdowns to mplx during the year were used in part to repurchase 237 billion  of our common stock additionally we expect to continue repurchasing our common stock in 2018 with cash received from the dropdown of our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services on february 1 2018 the table below summarizes our total share repurchases see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 9  for further discussion of the share repurchase plans 



we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market repurchases negotiated block transactions accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing and amount of future repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time 

contractual cash obligations 

the table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31 2017  the contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to mplx under various feebased commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 





capital spending 

mpc’s capital investment plan excluding mplx totals approximately 16 billion in 2018  for capital projects and investments excluding capitalized interest and acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below 



 refining  marketing 

the refining  marketing segment’s forecasted 2018  capital spending and investments is approximately 950 million  this amount includes approximately 400 million of growth capital focused on optimizing the galveston bay refinery upgrading residual fuel oils to highervalue products maximizing distillate production and expanding light product placement flexibility including exports sustaining capital is approximately 550 million which includes approximately 210 million related to regulatory spending for tier 3 gasoline a number of these projects span multiple years 

major projects completed over last three years have prepared us to meet the upcoming transportation fuel regulatory mandate tier 3 fuel standards increase our diesel production process light crude oil and increase our export capabilities in addition the transformational star investment project at our galveston bay refinery is progressing according to plan and is scheduled to complete in 2022 

speedway 

the speedway segment’s 2018  capital forecast of approximately 530 million  is focused on the construction of new store locations as well as remodeling and rebuilding existing locations consistent with our commitment to aggressively grow the business and build upon its industryleading position 

major projects over last three years included building new store locations remodeling and rebuilding existing locations in core markets and building out our network of commercial fueling lane locations to capitalize on diesel demand growth we also invested in the conversion remodel and maintenance of stores acquired in 2014 

midstream   

mplx’s capital investment plan includes 22 billion  of organic growth capital and approximately 190 million  of maintenance capital this growth plan includes the addition of eight processing plants representing nearly 15 bcfd of incremental processing capacity as well as 100000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity in the marcellus utica and permian basins the remaining growth capital is planned for the development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects including the exportcapacity expansion project at our galveston bay refinery 

major projects over last three years included investments for the development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure to support mplx’s producer customers primarily in the marcellus and utica shale regions development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects including a buildout of utica shale infrastructure in connection with the cornerstone pipeline a butane cavern in robinson illinois and a tank farm expansion in texas city texas the markwest merger comprised 85 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments in 2015 

the midstream   segment’s forecasted 2018  capital spend excluding mplx is approximately 15 million  

corporate and other 

the 2018  capital forecast includes approximately 85 million  to support corporate activities major projects over the last three years included an expansion project for our corporate headquarters and upgrades to information technology systems 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity capital resources and results of operations even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the offbalance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources 

we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil these arrangements are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25  

our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forwardlooking statements are based on currently available information if this information proves to be inaccurate future availability of financing may be adversely affected factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided by operating activities the state of worldwide debt and equity markets investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance the global financial climate and in particular with respect to borrowings the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies the discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forwardlooking statements regarding expected capital requirements and investment spending costs for projects under construction project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth upgrades and expansion the forwardlooking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance actual results may differ materially from these expectations estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include our ability to achieve the objectives related to the strategic initiatives discussed herein adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters our ability to generate sufficient income and cash flow to effect the intended share repurchases including within the expected timeframe our ability to manage disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit rating the potential impact on our share price if we are unable to effect the intended share repurchases the impact of adverse market conditions affecting mpcs and mplxs midstream businesses changes to the expected construction costs and timing of projects continuedfurther volatility in andor degradation of market and industry conditions the availability and pricing of crude oil and other feedstocks slower growth in domestic and canadian crude supply the effects of the lifting of the us crude oil export ban completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the us midwest consumer demand for refined products transportation logistics the reliability of processing units and other equipment mpcs ability to successfully implement growth opportunities modifications to mplx earnings and distribution growth objectives compliance with federal and state environmental economic health and safety energy and other policies and regulations including the cost of compliance with the renewable fuel standard andor enforcement actions initiated thereunder adverse results in litigation changes to mpcs capital budget other risk factors inherent to mpcs industry these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements for additional information on forwardlooking statements and risks that can affect our business see “disclosures regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

transactions with related parties 

we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7  for discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists 

with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers for additional information see item 1a risk factors 

our environmental expenditures including nonregulatory expenditures for each of the last three years were 



 we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation or regulations it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for ten  percent ten  percent and nine  percent of capital expenditures for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively excluding the acquisition of the ozark pipeline in 2017  and the markwest merger in 2015  our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 370 million  or 9 percent  of total planned capital expenditures in 2018  predictions beyond 2018  can only be broadbased estimates which have varied and will continue to vary due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies among other matters based on currently identified projects we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately 290 million  in 2019  however actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 

for more information on environmental regulations that impact us or could impact us see item 1 business  – environmental matters item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

 valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 

 impairment assessments of longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions significant assumptions include 

 we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a poor outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes a significant reduction in natural gas or ngls processed a significant reduction in refining margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets site level for speedway segment convenience stores and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream  segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value 

we own a 33 percent  undivided joint interest in the capline pipeline system “capline” which currently transports crude oil from st james louisiana to patoka illinois competing pipelines and changing oil transport routes in the us may result in a decline in volumes on capline in future years to levels that cannot sustain operations the owners of capline are considering various alternatives for the use of the pipeline system including an assessment of the commercial potential to reverse the pipeline direction within the next several years a nonbinding open season started in october 2017 and results indicated shipper interest in the reversal of capline as a result in december 2017 marathon pipe line llc a wholly owned subsidiary of mplx and operator of capline announced that the pipelines owners are proceeding with planning for the potential reversal of the pipeline including a plan to evaluate next steps required for a potential binding open season pending agreement among the owners southbound service is estimated to commence by the second half of 2022 developments in the commercial outlook for capline could result in incurring costs associated with retiring certain assets or an impairment of the carrying value o f our interest which was   159 million a s of   december 31 2017  

unlike longlived assets goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level we have thirteen reporting units nine of which have goodwill allocated to them at december 31 2017  we had a total of 359 billion  of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value for each of our reporting units in 2017 

mpc has nine reporting units with goodwill totaling approximately 359 billion as of november 30 2017 step 1 of the annual impairment analysis resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 22 percent to 406 percent the reporting unit with fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately 22 percent has goodwill of 228 million at december 31 2017  an increase of 150 percent to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of november 30 2017 significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units’ fair value included estimates of future cash flows if estimates for future cash flows which are impacted by commodity prices and producers’ production plans were to decline the overall reporting units’ fair value would decrease resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value at december 31 2017  we had 479 billion  of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

centennial is a refined products pipeline which experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2017 at december 31 2017  centennial was not shipping product as a result we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in centennial we concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of centennial’s assets if market conditions were to change and the owners of centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets there could be a future impairment of our centennial interest as of december 31 2017  our equity investment in centennial was 35 million  and we had a 25 million  guarantee associated with 50 percent of centennial’s outstanding debt see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25  for additional information on the debt guarantee 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to the carrying value of our centennial equity investment and our undivided joint interest in capline factors that could affect the carrying value of these assets include but are not limited to a change in business conditions a further decline or improvement in the longterm outlook of the potential 

uses of these assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

acquisitions 

in accounting for business combinations acquired assets assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired if any is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain respectively a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property plant and equipment intangible assets contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and for certain acquisitions engage thirdparty consultants for assistance 

the fair value of assets and liabilities including contingent consideration as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches including the income approach which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate the cost approach which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entityspecific differences the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value

we record all derivative instruments at fair value substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

variable interest entities 

we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests variable interests can be contractual ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie’s assets when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated 

significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie we evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest andor if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group we continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions 

changes in the design or nature of the activities of a vie or our involvement with a vie may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity’s status as a vie andor our status as the primary beneficiary such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization this could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary which would have a significant impact on our financial statements 

variable interest entities are discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6   

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 



 we utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuary’s discount rate model this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 355 percent   for our pension plans and 370 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 53 million and 31 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 5 million and 3 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 51 percent equity securities and 49 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness we used the 650 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2017 defined benefit pension expense after evaluating activity in the capital markets along with the current and projected plan investments we did not change the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 650 percent effective for 2018 decreasing the 650 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 4 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

we utilized the 2017 mortality tables from the us society of actuaries 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22  includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

contingent liabilities 

we accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions claims litigation environmental remediation tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and thirdparty indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable we regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons for instance settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes which are recorded as other taxes for additional information on contingent liabilities see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – environmental matters and compliance costs 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

as discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3  to our audited consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2017  we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 17  and 18  for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

refining  marketing 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also authorize the use of the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below lifo inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

midstream 

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond mplx’s control a portion of mplx’s profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at its own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by mplx’s producer customers such prices also indirectly affect profitability mplx has a committee comprised of senior management that oversees risk management activities continually monitors the risk management program and adjusts its strategy as conditions warrant derivative contracts utilized for crude oil natural gas and ngls are swaps and options traded on the otc market and fixed price forward contracts as a result of mplx’s current derivative positions it believes that it has mitigated a portion of its expected commodity price risk through the fourth quarter of 2018 mplx would be exposed to additional commodity risk in certain situations such as if producers under‑deliver or over‑deliver products or if processing facilities are operated in different recovery modes in the event that mplx has derivative positions in excess of the product delivered or expected to be delivered the excess derivative positions may be terminated 

mplx management conducts a standard credit review on counterparties to derivative contracts and it has provided the counterparties with a guaranty as credit support for its obligations a separate agreement with certain counterparties allows markwest liberty midstream to enter into derivative positions without posting cash collateral mplx uses standardized agreements that allow for offset of certain positive and negative exposures in the event of default or other terminating events including bankruptcy 

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the table below sets forth information relating to our significant open commodity derivative contracts as of december 31 2017  



a   998 percent  of exchangetraded contracts expire in the first quarter of 2018  

b   100 percent  of exchangetraded contracts expire in the first quarter of 2018  

c  chicago mercantile exchange “cme” 

d  intercontinental exchange “ice” 

e  reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending “rbob” 

sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2017  is provided in the following table 



we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2017  would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations related to our debt obligations at december 31 2017  our debt was primarily comprised of the 225 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued february 1 2011 the 195 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued september 5 2014 the 500 million  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mplx senior notes issued february 12 2015 the 150 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes 

issued december 15 2015 the 404 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mplx senior notes issued december 22 2015 and the 225 billion  aggregate principal amount mplx senior notes issued february 10 2017 additionally we have 505 million  of variable rate term debt 

sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint change in interest rates on longterm debt including the portion classified as current and excluding capital leases as of december 31 2017  is provided in the following table fair value of cash and cash equivalents receivables accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the shortterm maturity of the instruments accordingly these instruments are excluded from the table 



 at december 31 2017  our portfolio of longterm debt was comprised of fixedrate instruments and variablerate borrowings under the mplx bank revolving credit facility the fair value of our fixedrate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixedrate debt at prices above carrying value interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the mplx bank revolving credit facility but may affect our results of operations and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2017  

counterparty risk 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment by our customers to whom we provide services or sell natural gas or ngls we believe that certain contracts would allow us to pass those losses through to our customers thus reducing our risk when we are selling ngls and acting as our producer customers’ agent our credit exposure related to these customers is represented by the value of our trade receivables where exposed to credit risk we analyze the customer’s financial condition prior to entering into a transaction or agreement establish credit terms and monitor the appropriateness of these terms on an ongoing basis in the event of a customer default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by counterparties or future commission merchants our credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date these outstanding instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements should the creditworthiness of one or more of our counterparties decline our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party in the event of a counterparty default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted this counterparty credit risk does not apply to our embedded derivative as the overall value is a liability we regularly review the creditworthiness of counterparties and futures commission merchants and enter into master netting agreements when appropriate 

forwardlooking statements 

these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forwardlooking statements with respect to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to interest rates as well as market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil other refinery feedstocks refined products natural gas ngls and ethanol if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements

acquisitions and investments 

pipeline investments 

on september 1 2016 enbridge energy partners lp “enbridge energy partners” announced that its affiliate north dakota pipeline llc “north dakota pipeline” would withdraw certain pending regulatory applications for its sandpiper pipeline project and that the project would be deferred indefinitely these decisions were considered to indicate an impairment of the costs capitalized to date on the project as the operator of north dakota pipeline and the entity responsible for maintaining its financial records enbridge energy partners completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of august 31 2016 in accordance with asc topic 360 based on the estimated liquidation value of the fixed assets an impairment charge was recorded by north dakota pipeline based on our 375 percent  ownership of north dakota pipeline we recognized approximately 267 million  of this charge in the third quarter of 2016 through “income loss from equity method investments” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income which impaired virtually all of our 301 million investment in the project see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for information regarding the charge 

on february 15 2017 mplx closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire a partial indirect equity interest in the dakota access pipeline “dapl” and energy transfer crude oil company pipeline “etcop” projects collectively referred to as the bakken pipeline system through a joint venture with enbridge energy partners mplx contributed 500 million  of the 2 billion  purchase price paid by the joint venture to acquire a 3675 percent  indirect equity interest in the bakken pipeline system from energy transfer partners lp “etp” and sunoco logistics partners lp “sxl” mplx holds through a subsidiary a 25 percent  interest in the joint venture which equates to an approximate 92 percent  indirect equity interest in the bakken pipeline system the bakken pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470  mbpd of crude oil from the bakkenthree forks production area in north dakota to the midwest through patoka illinois and ultimately to the gulf coast furthermore mpc expects to become a committed shipper on the bakken pipeline system under terms of an ongoing open season 

in connection with closing the transaction with etp and sxl enbridge energy partners canceled mpc’s transportation services agreement with respect to the sandpiper pipeline project and released mpc from paying any termination fee per that agreement 

in july 2014 we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in enbridge inc’s southern access extension “sax” pipeline which runs from flanagan illinois to patoka illinois this option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the sax pipeline we have contributed 299 million  since project inception the pipeline became operational in december 2015 our investment in the pipeline is included in our midstream  segment 

marine investments 

we currently have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures with crowley maritime corporation “crowley” which were established to own and operate jones act vessels in petroleum product service we have invested a total of 189 million in these two ventures as described further below 

in september 2015 we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture crowley ocean partners llc “crowley ocean partners” with crowley the joint venture owns and operates four new jones act product tankers three of which are leased to mpc two of the vessels were delivered in 2015 and the remaining two were delivered in 2016 we contributed a total of 141 million  for the four vessels 

in may 2016 mpc and crowley formed a new ocean vessel joint venture crowley coastal partners llc “crowley coastal partners” in which mpc has a 50 percent  ownership interest mpc and crowley each contributed their 50 percent  ownership in crowley ocean partners discussed above into crowley coastal partners in addition we contributed 48 million  in cash and crowley contributed its 100 percent ownership interest in crowley blue water partners llc “crowley blue water partners” to crowley coastal partners crowley blue water partners is an entity that owns and operates three  750 series atb vessels that are leased to mpc we account for our 50 percent  interest in crowley coastal partners as part of our midstream segment using the equity method of accounting 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6  for additional information on crowley coastal partners as a vie and note 25  for information on our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of crowley ocean partners and crowley blue water partners 

markwest merger 

on december 4 2015 a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx the midstream master limited partnership sponsored by mpc merged with markwest whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the markwest merger was converted into a right to receive 109 common units of mplx representing limited partner interests in mplx plus a onetime cash payment of 620  per unit each class b unit of markwest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one class b unit of mplx having substantially similar rights including conversion and registration rights and obligations that the class b units of markwest had immediately prior to the merger at closing we contributed 123 billion in cash to mplx to pay the cash consideration to markwest common unitholders we agreed to contribute an additional total of 50 million in cash to mplx for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the mplx class b units to mplx common units in equal installments the first 25 million of which was paid in july 2016 and the second 25 million of which will be paid in july 2017 these contributions are with respect to mpc’s existing interests in mplx including idrs and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in mplx we assigned the total consideration transferred of 861 billion including the 733 billion fair value of the equity consideration and the 128 billion of cash contributions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interest assumed in the markwest merger with the excess recorded as goodwill during the first quarter of 2016 the preliminary fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded in the 2015 yearend financial statements were revised based on additional analysis these adjustments to the fair values of property plant and equipment intangibles and equity investments among other items resulted in an offsetting reduction to goodwill of approximately 241 million as a result we recognized total assets acquired of 1191 billion including 852 billion of property plant and equipment and 260 billion of equity investments and total liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of 551 billion including 457 billion of assumed debt goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances mplx recorded an impairment charge of approximately 129 million in the first quarter of 2016 to impair a portion of the 221 billion of goodwill as adjusted recorded in connection with the markwest merger in the second quarter of 2016 mplx completed its purchase price allocation which resulted in an additional 1 million of impairment expense that would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2016 had the purchase price allocation been completed as of that date this adjustment to the impairment expense was the result of completing an evaluation of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the markwest merger and their impact on the resulting goodwill that was recognized our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of markwest from the date of the acquisition 

consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business the markwest merger combines one of the nation’s largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by mpc the complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of markwest mplx and mpc provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain the combined entity furthers markwests leading midstream presence in the marcellus and utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects allowing producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions 

hess retail acquisition 

on september 30 2014 we acquired from hess corporation “hess” all of its retail locations transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines including approximately 40  mbpd on colonial pipeline for 282 billion  we refer to these assets as “hess’ retail operations and related assets” and substantially all of these assets are part of our speedway segment this acquisition significantly expanded our speedway presence from nine  to 22  states throughout the east coast and southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow our retail business this acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations providing an assured outlet for incremental sales from our refining system the transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of hess’ retail operations and related assets from the date of the acquisition 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5  for additional information on these acquisitions and investments 

mplx lp 

overview 

mplx is a diversified growthoriented publicly traded master limited partnership formed by us to own operate develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets mplx is engaged in the gathering processing and transportation of natural gas the gathering transportation fractionation storage and marketing of ngls and the gathering transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products on december 4 2015 we completed the markwest merger whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx 

as of december 31 2016  we owned a 255 percent  interest in mplx including a two percent  general partner interest this ownership percentage reflects the conversion of the mplx class b units in july 2017 at 109  to 100 mplx is a vie because the limited partners of mplx do not have substantive kickout or substantive participating rights over the general partner we are the primary beneficiary of mplx because in addition to significant economic interest we also have the power through our 100 percent  ownership of the general partner to control the decisions that most significantly impact mplx we therefore consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 745 percent  interest owned by the public the components of our noncontrolling interest consist of equitybased noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest the redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to mplx’s preferred units discussed below 

the creditors of mplx do not have recourse to mpc’s general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements the assets of mplx are the property of mplx and cannot be used to satisfy the obligations of mpc 

reorganization transactions 

on september 1 2016 mpc mplx and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify mplx’s ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting in connection with these transactions mpc contributed 225 million  to mplx and all of the issued and outstanding mplx class a units all of which were held by markwest hydrocarbon llc “markwest hydrocarbon” a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx were exchanged for newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in mplx the simple average of the closing prices of mplx common units for the last 10 trading days prior to september 1 2016 was used for purposes of these transactions as a result of these transactions mpc increased its ownership interest in mplx by 7 million  mplx common units or approximately 1 percent  

private placement of preferred units 

on may 13 2016 mplx completed the private placement of approximately 308 million   65 percent  series a convertible preferred units the “mplx preferred units” at a cash price of 3250  per unit the aggregate net proceeds of approximately 984 million  from the sale of the mplx preferred units was used for capital expenditures repayment of debt and general partnership purposes 

the mplx preferred units rank senior to all mplx common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation the holders of the mplx preferred units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to 0528125  per unit commencing for the quarter ended june 30 2016 with a prorated amount from the date of issuance following the second anniversary of the issuance of the mplx preferred units the holders of the mplx preferred units will receive as a distribution the greater of 0528125  per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common unitholders the mplx preferred units are convertible into mplx common units on a one for one basis after three years at the purchasers’ option and after four years at mplx’s option subject to certain conditions   

the mplx preferred units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside mplx’s control therefore they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets we have recorded the mplx preferred units at their issuance date fair value net of issuance costs since the mplx preferred units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable that the security would become redeemable 

contribution of inland marine business to mplx 

on march 31 2016 we contributed our inland marine business to mplx in exchange for 23 million  mplx common units and 460 thousand  mplx general partner units the number of units we received from mplx was determined by dividing 600 million  by the volume weighted average nyse price of mplx common units for the 10 trading days preceding march 14 2016 pursuant to the membership interests contribution agreement we also agreed to waive firstquarter 2016 common unit distributions idrs and general partner distributions with respect to the common units issued in this transaction the contribution of our inland marine business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and therefore we did not record a gain or loss

our competitive strengths 

extensive integrated platform of midstream retail and refining assets 

we believe the relative scale of our integrated midstream retail and refining assets distinguishes us from other refining companies we currently own lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8400  miles of crude oil and products pipelines additionally we have over 5600  miles of natural gas and ngl pipelines we also own or have ownerships interests in one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the united states as well as trucking and rail assets we operate this transportation and distribution system in coordination with our refining and marketing network enabling us to optimize raw material supplies and refined product distribution and deliver important economies of scale across our platform our speedway segment one of our largest distribution channels is also our most ratable 

we believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost we also believe our integrated platform of assets gives us extensive flexibility and optionality to respond promptly to dynamic market conditions including weatherrelated and marketplace disruptions 

competitively positioned marketing operations provide assured product sales 

we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area we have two strong retail brands speedway ®  and marathon ®  we believe speedway llc a whollyowned subsidiary operates the second largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states with approximately 2730  convenience stores in 21  states throughout the midwest east coast and southeast regions of the united states in addition our highly successful speedy rewards ®  customer loyalty program which averaged more than 57 million  active members in 2016  provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our speedway customer base at existing and new speedway locations the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states comprised of approximately 5500  retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19  states as of december 31 2016  the marathon brand has been a vehicle for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets 

we consider assured sales as those sales we make to marathon brand customers our speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts our assured sales currently account for approximately 70 of our gasoline production we believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations between our refineries pipelines and terminals 

high quality network of strategically located assets 

we believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the midwest and the third largest in the united states based on crude oil refining capacity we own a seven plant refinery network with approximately 18  mmbpcd of crude oil throughput capacity our refineries process a wide range of crude oils feedstocks and condensate including heavy and sour crude oils which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates specialty chemicals and other refined products while we have historically processed significant quantities of heavy and sour crude oils our refineries have the ability to process approximately 65 percent to 70 percent light sweet crude oils 

the geographic locations of our refineries provide us with strategic advantages located in padd ii and padd iii which consist of states in the midwest and the gulf coast regions of the united states our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources including domestic canadian and other foreign sources which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs for example geographic proximity to various united states shale oil regions and canadian crude oil supply sources allows our refineries access to priceadvantaged crude oils and lower transportation costs than certain of our competitors our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access refined product export markets and to serve a broad range of key enduser markets across the united states quickly and costeffectively 

our midstream  segment assets are similarly located in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states which collectively comprised approximately 81 percent of total united states crude distillation capacity and approximately 81 percent of total united states finished products demand for the year ended december 31 2016  according to the eia mplx through markwest its whollyowned subsidiary is the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions this significantly complements and creates strategic opportunities for our refining  marketing segment and mplx’s logistic assets in the same geographic footprint our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas ngls and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets our midstream gathering and processing operations include approximately 7500  mmcfd of natural gas processing capacity 500  mbpd of fractionation capacity and more than 5600  miles of gas gathering and ngl pipelines as of december 31 2016  

our speedway segment which operates in the midwest east coast and southeast complements our refining and midstream assets providing a significant and ratable outlet for our refinery production our speedway operations have also enabled us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations with its expansion from nine to 21  states throughout the east coast and southeast speedway is a top tier performer in the convenience store industry with the highest ebitda per store per month of its public peers and leading positions with respect to other comparisons based on light product volume merchandise sales and total gross margin on a per store per month basis 

 as of december 31 2016   

general partner and sponsor of mplx 

our investment in mplx provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets all with the focus of enhancing our share price through our limited partner and general partner interests in mplx which tend to receive higher market multiples mplx’s liquidity size scale and access to the capital markets should provide us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream business 

we have an extensive portfolio of mlpqualifying midstream assets we plan to offer assets from this portfolio which are estimated to generate annual ebitda of approximately 14 billion to mplx as soon as practicable in 2017 subject to regulatory clearances including tax clearance and market and other conditions in conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns we expect to pursue an exchange of our economic interests in the general partner including incentive distribution rights for newly issued mplx common units following the exchange we would continue to retain control of the general partner so that we can continue to optimize our refinery feedstock and distribution networks 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on these midstream assets including the timing of these strategic actions 

established track record of profitability and growing our midstream and retail businesses 

we have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the refining cycle we believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results income generated by our speedway segment is less sensitive to business cycles similarly income from our midstream segment which was significantly expanded through the markwest merger is more stable over business cycles due to its longterm fee based contracts while our refining  marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable 

strong financial position 

as of december 31 2016  we had 653 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 418 billion  in unused committed borrowing facilities excluding mplx’s cash and cash equivalents of 234 million  and its credit facilities we had 1057 billion  of debt at yearend which represented 33  percent of our total capitalization this combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage provides financial flexibility to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies 

our business strategies 

maintain toptier safety and environmental performance 

we remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continual improvement in our safety record across all of our operations we have a history of safe and reliable operations which was demonstrated again in 2016 with a strong process safety performance compared to the industry average in addition our corporate headquarters four of our refineries and eight additional facilities have earned designations as an osha vpp star site we also remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency and reliability of our operations we have earned 75 percent of the epa’s energy star recognitions awarded to refineries despite owning and operating just 10 percent of total us refining capacity we proactively address our regulatory requirements and encourage our operations to improve their environmental performance through our dei program which establishes goals and measures environmental performance in 2016 we achieved our best performance since the current program began in 2010   with a third straight year of improving performance markwest will be incorporated into our dei program in 2017 

grow higher valued stable cash flow businesses 

we intend to continue to allocate significant portions of our capital to investments intended to grow our midstream and retail businesses these businesses typically have more predictable and stable income and cash flows compared to our refining operations and we believe investors assign a higher value to such businesses 

mplx is an important part of this strategy and the markwest merger significantly expanded its midstream activities mplx will consider organic growth projects that provide attractive returns and cash flows both within its geographic footprint as well as in new regions mplx may pursue these opportunities as standalone projects with mpc or with other parties mplx has identified a number of potential projects over the next several years these primarily include projects to expand gathering processing and fractionation infrastructure in the marcellus region 

our speedway segment is also an important part of this strategy we significantly expanded speedway’s presence along the east coast and southeast through the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets in september 2014 we intend to continue growing speedway’s sales and profitability by focusing on organic growth through filling in voids in our existing markets by building new locations and by rebuilding or remodeling existing stores we will also look to expand our presence by opportunistically acquiring high quality stores in new and existing markets we have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market with a continued focus in pennsylvania and tennessee as well as opportunities for growth in new markets including georgia south carolina and the florida panhandle we also plan to capitalize on diesel demand growth by building out our network of commercial fueling lane locations within our core market which cater to local and regional transport fleets 

in keeping with our practice of evaluating shareholder value creation a special committee of our board of directors with the assistance of an independent financial advisor will conduct a full and thorough review of strategic and financial alternatives for speedway we expect to provide an update on the review by mid2017 

maintain longterm integrated relationships with our producer customers 

mplx’s markwest subsidiary has developed longterm integrated relationships with its producer customers these relationships are characterized by an intense focus on customer service and a deep understanding of producer customers’ requirements coupled with the ability to increase the level of our midstream services in response to their midstream requirements through collaborative planning with these producer customers mplx’s markwest subsidiary continues to construct highquality midstream infrastructure and provide unique solutions that are critical to the ongoing success of producer customers’ development plans as a result of these efforts markwest has been a toprated midstream service provider in customer satisfaction since 2006 as determined by an independent research provider 

pursue margin enhancing investments in refining to deliver top quartile refining performance 

our refineries are well positioned to benefit from the growing crude oil and condensate production in north america including the bakken eagle ford and utica shale regions along with the canadian oil sands we are also well positioned to export distillates gasoline and other products 

we intend to enhance margins in our refining  marketing segment by realizing benefits from continuous process improvements and targeted investments in our refining operations over the next five years we intend to create a worldclass refining complex by investing approximately 15 billion in our galveston bay refinery through the star project this investment will fully integrate our galveston bay and texas city refineries and enable us to upgrade low value residual oil into higher value refined products and lower the refinery complex’s cost of production the project scope increases crude processing capacity increases distillate and gas oil recovery and improves the refinery’s overall reliability we are also planning to expand the galveston bay refinery’s product export capacity to reach high value markets in addition we are investing at our garyville refinery to increase ulsd production due to strong longterm distillate demand expectations 

sustain focus on disciplined capital allocation and shareholder returns 

we intend to maintain our focus on a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation including return of capital to shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile since becoming a standalone company in june 2011 our dividend has increased by a 28 percent compound annual growth rate and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling 10 billion  through open market purchases and two asr programs we repurchased 202 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 744 billion  representing approximately 28  percent of our outstanding common shares when we became a standalone company in june 2011 after the effects of these repurchases 256 billion  of the 10 billion  total authorization was available for future repurchases as of december 31 2016  we achieved these shareholder returns while also investing in the business and maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile 

cash proceeds from the planned dropdowns and ongoing mplx common unit distributions resulting from the dropdowns and other strategic actions are expected to fund the substantial ongoing return of capital to our shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile 

utilize and enhance our high quality employee workforce 

we utilize our high quality employee workforce by continuing to leverage our commercial skills in addition we continue to enhance our workforce through selective hiring practices and effective training programs on safety environmental stewardship and other professional and technical skills

gasoline and distillates  we sell gasoline gasoline blendstocks and distillates including no 1 and no 2 fuel oils jet fuel kerosene and diesel fuel to wholesale customers marathonbranded independent entrepreneurs and our speedway ®  convenience stores and on the spot market in addition we sell diesel fuel and gasoline for export to international customers we sold 50  percent of our gasoline sales volumes and 87  percent of our distillates sales volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2016  the demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months 

we have blended ethanol into gasoline for more than 25 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007 in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline were 84  mbpd in 2016  85  mbpd in 2015  and 78  mbpd in 2014  we sell reformulated gasoline which is also blended with ethanol in 12  states in our marketing area we also sell biodieselblended diesel fuel in 18  states in our marketing area the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol and biodiesel blending programs will be driven by market economics and government regulations 

propane  we produce propane at most of our refineries propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and petrochemical consumers 

feedstocks and petrochemicals  we are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and petrochemicals product availability varies by refinery and includes platformate alkylate fcc unit gas naptha dry gas propylene raffinate butane benzene xylene molten sulfur cumene and toluene we market these products domestically to customers in the chemical agricultural and fuelblending industries in addition we produce fuelgrade coke at our garyville detroit and galveston bay refineries which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications and anodegrade coke at our robinson refinery which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry our feedstocks and petrochemical sales decreased to 231  mbpd in 2016 from 258  mbpd in 2015 and decreased in 2015 from 268  mbpd in 2014 the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to more feedstocks used in production versus selling them on the spot market the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to higher turnaround activity in 2014 resulting in more available feedstocks more feedstocks used in production versus selling them on the spot market and market conditions in 2015 

heavy fuel oil  we produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components including slurry at all of our refineries heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering fuel industries though there are other more specialized uses of the product 

asphalt  we have refinerybased asphalt production capacity of up to 102  mbpcd which includes asphalt cements polymermodified asphalt emulsified asphalt industrial asphalts and roofing flux we have a broad customer base including asphaltpaving contractors government entities states counties cities and townships and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers we sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail barge and vessel

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products based upon the “the oil  gas journal 2016  worldwide refinery survey” we ranked third among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity as of december 31 2016  

we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale spot branded and retail distribution we believe we compete with about 50  companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers about 100  companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market 12  refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded independent entrepreneurs and approximately 850  retailers in the retail sale of refined products in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and retail consumers we do not produce any of the crude oil we refine 

we also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their independent entrepreneurs and other wellrecognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers often selling gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise at competitive prices nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into sales of retail gasoline and diesel fuel energy analysts international inc estimated such retailers had approximately 15  percent of the us gasoline market in mid 2016  

our midstream  operations face competition for natural gas gathering crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services in obtaining unprocessed ngls for gathering and fractionation and in marketing our products and services competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants operating efficiency and reliability and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of capacity proximity to supply and industry marketing centers and cost efficiency and reliability of service competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and ngls is based primarily on price delivery capabilities flexibility and maintenance of highquality customer relationships in addition certain of our midstream  operations are highly regulated which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils wti and lls crude oils and other market structure differentials also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

our midstream  segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and ngls and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year in the northeast region we could be particularly impacted by seasonality as the majority of its revenues are generated by ngl sales however we manage the seasonality impact through the execution of our marketing strategy we have access to up to 50 million gallons of propane storage capacity in the northeast region provided by an arrangement with a thirdparty which provides us with flexibility to manage the seasonality impact overall our exposure to the seasonal fluctuations in the commodity markets is declining due to our growth in feebased business 

environmental matters 

our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for reviewing our overall environmental performance we also have a corporate emergency response team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review discussion or implementation the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant for additional information see item 1a risk factors we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products additionally we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable 

our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment such laws and regulations include among others the clean air act “caa” with respect to air emissions the clean water act “cwa” with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized 

for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air water solid waste and remediation see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters and compliance costs 

air 

we are subject to many requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations internationally and domestically emphasis has been placed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions the us pledge in 2009 as part of the copenhagen accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect and was reaffirmed in president obama’s 2013 climate action plan although the united states signed the 2015 paris agreement on climate change it does not legally require parties to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the united states’ future activities in response to the paris agreement are unknown   in november 2016 the obama administration released its strategy for “deep decarbonization” which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 the us climate change strategy and implementation of that strategy through legislation and regulation may change under president trump’s administration therefore the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time 

in 2009 the epa issued an “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to the endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles the endangerment finding the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act resulted in permitting of greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources but as a result of the epa’s “tailoring rule” permit applicability was limited to larger sources such as refineries legal challenges were filed against these epa actions in june 2014 the united states supreme court ruled that the clean air act prevention of significant deterioration program for new and modified major stationary sources is not triggered by greenhouse gas emissions alone the united states supreme court did however uphold the requirement for new or modified stationary sources that will also emit a criteria pollutant to control greenhouse gas emissions through best available control technology implementing best available control technology may result in increased costs to our operations a few mpc projects may trigger greenhouse gas permitting requirements but any additional capital spending will likely not be significant 

the epa has finalized source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions for new and existing electric utility generating units these standards could impact electric and natural gas rates for all our operations legal challenges have been filed by several states and by industry groups seeking to overturn the final rules in february 2016 the united states supreme court stayed implementation of the standards for existing utility generating units also known as the clean power plan until complete disposition of the litigation   congress may again also consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax in the   absence of federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions states may become more active in regulating greenhouse gas emissions these measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions these measures may also include low carbon fuel standards such as the california program in addition private parties have sued utilities and other emitters of greenhouse gas emissions but such suits have been largely unsuccessful we have not been named in any of those lawsuits private parties have also sued federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken in sum requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments these requirements may also significantly affect mpc’s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the extent and magnitude of the impact from greenhouse gas regulation or legislation cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 

in 2013 the obama administration made changes to the social cost of carbon “scc” estimate the scc was first issued in 2010 the scc is to be used by the epa and other federal agencies in regulatory costbenefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases in 2013 the obama administration significantly increased the estimate to 36 per ton in response to the regulated community and congress’ critiques of how the scc was developed the office of management and budget provided an opportunity to comment on the scc but ultimately did not make any significant revisions in august 2016 the white house council on environmental quality issued its final guidance to federal agencies on assessing a project’s impact to climate change under the national environmental policy act by requiring an estimation of the greenhouse gas emissions from the project including using the scc when analyzing costs and benefits of a project while the impact of a higher scc in future regulations is not known at this time it may result in increased costs to our operations the epa has also used an estimate of the social cost of methane in its regulatory impact analysis to justify regulating methane as a pollutant for new and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector 

in 2015 the epa finalized a revision to the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for ozone the epa lowered the primary ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to 70 ppb this revision initiates a multiyear process in which nonattainment designations will be made based on more recent ozone measurements that includes data from 2016 states will then propose and adopt as necessary new rules reducing emissions to meet the new standard currently the epa is in the process of implementing the 75 ppb ozone standard that the epa had promulgated in march 2008 the impact of a stricter standard cannot be accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding area nonattainment designations and the additional requirements that states may impose additionally legal petitions challenging the revised ozone standard have been filed adding uncertainty to the revised standard 

on september 29 2015 the epa signed the final regulations revising existing refinery air emissions standards the revised regulations were published in the federal register on december 1 2015 the revised rule requires additional controls lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring we do not anticipate that mpc’s costs to comply with the revised regulations will be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other things requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances opa90 also requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages and provides for civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we operate tank vessels and facilities from which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements 

additionally opa90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be doublehulled and that existing tank vessels that are not doublehulled be retrofitted or removed from us service all barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the doublehulled requirements of opa90 some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

in june 2015 the epa and the united states army corps of engineers finalized significant changes to the definition of the term “waters of the united states” “wotus” used in numerous programs under the cwa this final rulemaking is referred to as the clean water rule the clean water rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts by many states trade groups and other interested parties and in october 2015 a united states court of appeals issued a nationwide stay of the clean water rule the clean water rule as written expands permitting planning and reporting obligations and may extend the timing to secure permits for pipeline and fixed asset construction and maintenance activities the clean water rule does contain new language intended to address concerns that the proposed rule included storm water conveyances and storage structures as wotus and we continue to review how that new language will apply under specific circumstances court challenges of the clean water rule will continue through 2017 

in 2015 the epa issued its intent to review the cwa categorical effluent limitation guidelines “elg” for the petroleum refining sector during 2016 the epa prepared a draft information request “icr” requesting significant wastewater and treatment process details and may perform sampling of effluent at one or more of our refineries the icr is expected to issue in 2017 the epa has indicated they believe there have been significant changes in the characteristics of wastewaters generated within refining operations that warrant the review specific targets for the review are the impacts of processing heavier crude oils and the transfer of air pollutants to wastewater when air pollution abatement devices are in use a similar project initiated in 2007 for steam power generation with similar attributes resulted in a significant change in the treatment requirements for coalfired power plants the refining sector elg review has the potential to result in a similar impact we are actively engaged in the planning process for the 2017 information request and effluent sampling campaign and engaged with the american petroleum institute and the american fuel  petrochemical manufacturers associations on this matter the typical lifecycle for an elg review from the intent to review to issuance of a final rule that would require upgrades is seven years the impact of an elg review cannot be accurately estimated at this time 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of usts containing regulated substances we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at two of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite thirdparty treatment and disposal facilities ongoing rcrarelated costs however are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain convenience stores and other locations where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the applicable state laws and regulations a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

mileage standards renewable fuels and other fuels requirements 

in 2007 the us congress passed the energy independence and security act “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 and contains the rfs2 in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking   by the nhtsa the epa in the fourth quarter of 2016 determined that its proposed targets for ghg reduction are achievable and did not adjust its 

2022 to 2025 estimated standards new or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations 

the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 2225 billion gallons in 2016 240 billion gallons in 2017 and increase to 360 billion gallons by 2022 within the total volume of renewable fuel eisa established an advanced biofuel volume of 725 billion gallons in 2016 90 billion gallons in 2017 and increasing to 210 billion gallons in 2022 subsets within the advanced biofuel volume include biomassbased diesel which was set as at least 10 billion gallons in 2014 through 2022 to be determined by the epa through rulemaking and cellulosic biofuel which was set at 425 billion gallons in 2016 55 billion gallons in 2017 and increasing to 160 billion gallons in 2022 

on november 30 2015 the epa finalized the renewable fuel standards for the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 as well as the biomassbased diesel standard for 2017 because the epa missed the statutory deadlines for establishing the standards for 2014 and 2015 the epa used its waiver authority under eisa to set the standards using actual consumption data obtained from epa’s tracking system emts the epa’s use of its general waiver authority to reduce the statutory volumes has been challenged in court a court decision vacating the 20142016 renewable fuel standards on the basis that the epa unreasonably exercised its general waiver authority could increase our cost of compliance with the renewable fuels standards and be detrimental to the rin market 

on november 23 2016 the epa finalized the renewable fuel standards for the year 2017 and the biomass based diesel standard for 2018 the epa used its cellulosic waiver authority to reduce the standards from the statutory amounts to the following 1928 billion gallons total renewable fuel 428 billion gallons advanced biofuel and 311 million gallons cellulosic ethanol the epa increased the biomass based diesel standard for 2018 to 20 billion gallons in the near term the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline vehicle regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline “e10” the volumes for 2016 and 2017 result in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the e10 blendwall which will require obligated parties to either sell e15 or flexfuel at levels that exceed historical levels or retire carryover rins that had been generated in prior years on october 13 2016 the epa issued a partial waver decision under the caa to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from e10 to e15 for 2007 and newer lightduty motor vehicles on january 21 2011 the epa issued a second waver for the use of e15 in vehicles model year 20012006 there are numerous issues including state and federal regulatory issues which need to be addressed before e15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines additionally there are infrastructure compatibility issues and vehicle manufacturer warranty concerns related to e15 usage neither e15 nor flexfuel has been readily accepted by the consumer 

with potentially uncertain supplies the advanced biofuels programs may present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels including biomassbased diesel and cellulosic biofuel 

we made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel rfs2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product and by buying needed biodiesel rins in the epacreated biodiesel rins market on april 1 2014 we purchased a facility in cincinnati ohio which currently produces biodiesel glycerin and other byproducts the capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million  gallons per year as a producer of biodiesel we now generate rins thereby reducing our reliance on the external rin market 

on november 10 2016 the epa proposed to deny petitions requesting that the point of obligation for the rfs be moved to the terminal rack the epa is accepting comments on its proposed denial should the epa decide that its proposal was incorrect and move the point of obligation we could be subject to increased costs and compliance uncertainties 

the rfs2 has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 

on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm we anticipate that we will spend approximately 650 million between 2014 and 2019 to comply with these standards which includes estimated capital expenditures of approximately 200 million in 2017 

trademarks patents and licenses 

our marathon trademark is material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations and our speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail marketing operations we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole in general we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of knowhow rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations 

employees 

we had approximately 44460  regular fulltime and parttime employees as of december 31 2016  which includes approximately 32880  employees of speedway 

certain hourly employees at our canton catlettsburg galveston bay and texas city refineries are represented by the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that are due to expire in 2019 the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees at our detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is also scheduled to expire in 2019 in addition they represent certain hourly employees at speedway under agreements that cover certain outlets in new york and new jersey that expire on march 14 2019 and june 30 2019 respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate while others relate to the ownership of our common stock 

our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business 

a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products the measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil or crack spread is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins historically refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions any overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins many of the factors influencing a change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control these factors include 

 some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce which may reduce our revenues income from operations and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures impair the carrying value of our assets such as property plant and equipment inventory or goodwill decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages severe weather labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as acts of terrorism for example pipelines provide a nearlyexclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries in such instances a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including but not limited to explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

we rely on the performance of our information technology systems the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and network infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems involve data network and telecommunications internet access and website functionality and various computer hardware equipment and software applications including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business these systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters software viruses or other malware power failures cyberattacks and other events we also face various other cybersecurity threats including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans there can be no guarantee such plans to the extent they are in place will be effective 

the retail market is diverse and highly competitive and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business 

we face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices several nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business these nontraditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow because of their diversity integration of operations experienced management and greater financial resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market in addition these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts adversely affecting our profit margins additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the development availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred 

we have significant debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

at december 31 2016  our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were 111 billion  including 49 billion  of obligations of mplx we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

 a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money andor limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to 750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables in periods of lower prices we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations including those of mplx and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief 

which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 36 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements certain hourly employees at our canton catlettsburg galveston bay and texas city refineries are represented by the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that are due to expire in 2019 the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees at our detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is also scheduled to expire in 2019 in addition they represent certain hourly employees at speedway under agreements that cover certain outlets in new york and new jersey that expire on march 14 2019 and june 30 2019 respectively these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us in addition we have experienced or may experience work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership mplx which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if foreign investment in us or mplx exceeds certain levels mplx could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920 which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens among other requirements to establish citizenship entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by us citizens if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws mplx would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although the spinoff occurred in mid2011 certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil however if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries whether accruing before on or after the spinoff we also agreed to be responsible for and indemnify marathon oil with respect to all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff or certain internal restructuring transactions failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368a and 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation warranty covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement in addition we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified taxrelated liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities at this time we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts 

also in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions that were required to affect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves the tax liabilities and underlying liabilities in the event marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and commercial synergies that are anticipated from the markwest merger 

the benefits that are expected to result from the markwest merger will depend in part on mplx’s ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and commercial synergies as a result of the markwest merger mplx’s success in realizing these growth opportunities and commercial synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of mplx and markwest there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as markwest the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of mplx and markwest members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company maintain relationships with employees customers or suppliers attract new customers and develop new strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that mplx will successfully or costeffectively integrate markwest the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if mplx is able to integrate markwest successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and commercial synergies that we currently expect from this integration and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all for example mplx may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover mplx may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of markwest while it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve commercial synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the markwest merger may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the businesses 

significant acquisitions in the future will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows  

significant future transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks which may include among others 



a significant decrease or delay in oil and natural gas production in mplx’s areas of operation whether due to sustained declines in oil natural gas and ngl prices natural declines in well production or otherwise may adversely affect mplx’s business results of operations and financial condition and could reduce mplx’s ability to make distributions to us 

a significant portion of mplx’s operations are dependent upon production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells which will naturally decline over time which means that mplx’s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of mplx’s facilities mplx must continually obtain new oil natural gas ngl and refined product supplies which depends in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities 

we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of mplx’s operations the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline in addition we have no control over producers or their production decisions which are affected by among other things prevailing and projected energy prices drilling costs per mcf or barrel demand for hydrocarbons operational challenges access to downstream markets the level of reserves geological considerations governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital because of these factors even if new oil or natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by mplx assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves if mplx is not able to obtain new supplies of oil or natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells throughput on mplx pipelines and the utilization rates of mplx facilities would decline which could have a material adverse effect on mplx’s business results of operations and financial condition and could reduce mplx’s ability to make distributions to us 

decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves the prices for oil natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond our control including global and local demand production levels changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications imports and exports seasonality and weather conditions economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations sustained periods of low prices could result in producers also significantly curtailing or limiting their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil gas and ngls to mplx’s facilities and adversely affect mplx’s revenues and cash available for distribution to us this impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of mplx’s commoditybased contracts which are more directly impacted by changes in gas and ngl prices than its feebased contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a btu equivalent basis than ngl products in addition mplx’s purchase and resale of gas and ngls in the ordinary course exposes mplx to significant risk of volatility in gas or ngl prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of mplx’s production processes the significant fluctuation and decline in natural gas ngl and oil prices currently occurring has adversely impacted mplx’s unit price thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital such impacts could adversely impact mplx’s ability to execute its long‑term organic growth projects satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels and may also result in noncash impairments of longlived assets or goodwill or otherthantemporary noncash impairments of our equity method investments 

our recently announced strategic actions designed to enhance shareholder value may not deliver the anticipated benefits 

in january 2017 we announced updates to our previously announced strategic actions designed to enhance shareholder value including the significant acceleration of dropdowns of midstream assets into mplx and the expected exchange of our economic interests in the general partner including incentive distribution rights for newly issued mplx common units in conjunction with the completion of such dropdowns we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of these actions as we may not be able to implement the announced strategic actions due to the inability to agree with the mplx conflicts committee with respect to the value attributed to assets identified for dropdown the adequacy of mplx’s capital and liquidity including but not limited to mplx’s access to debt to fund the anticipated dropdowns on commercially reasonable terms and the time cost and ability to obtain requisite approvals and regulatory clearances including tax clearance in addition the market price of our common stock could decline if securities or industry analysts or our investors disagree with these strategic actions or the way we implement such actions accordingly even if we are able to implement some or all of the strategic actions successfully there is no assurance that these actions will be reflected in the market price of our stock to the extent currently anticipated by management 

significant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to affect changes or acquire control over our company campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies as a result stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to our industry 

changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following 

 the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

because the issue of climate change continues to receive scientific and political attention there is the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations the us pledge in 2009 as part of the copenhagen accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect and was reaffirmed in the president’s 2013 climate action plan the 2015 paris un climate change conference agreement aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in november 2016 the obama administration released its strategy for “deep decarbonization” which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 the us climate change strategy and implementation of that strategy through legislation and regulation may change under the new administration therefore the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time 

in october 2015 the epa finalized regulations to reduce carbon emissions from new modified and reconstructed power plants new source performance standards and from existing power plants existing source performance standards also known as the clean power plan through the regulations the epa is requiring a reduction in nationwide carbon emissions from the power generation sector by 32 percent below 2005 levels these standards could increase our electricity costs and potentially reduce the reliability of our electricity supply in february 2016 the us supreme court stayed implementation of the clean power plan until the legal challenge filed by several states and industry could be heard by the courts 

the obama administration developed the social cost of carbon “scc” which is to be used by the epa and other federal agencies in regulatory costbenefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases the scc was first issued in 2010 in 2013 the obama administration significantly increased the estimate to 36 per ton in response to the regulated community and congress’ critiques of how the scc was developed the office of management and budget “omb” provided an opportunity to comment on the scc in july 2015 the omb issued a response to comments and a revised technical support document explaining adjustments to the scc calculations additionally in august 2016 the white house council on environmental quality issued its final guidance to federal agencies on assessing a project’s impact to climate change under the national environmental policy act by estimating the greenhouse gas emissions from the project including using the scc when analyzing costs and benefits of a project while the impact of a higher scc in future regulations is not known at this time it may result in increased costs to our operations 

an article on the social cost of methane has also been published and was used by the epa in its regulatory impact analysis of the proposed emission standards for new and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector these regulations were proposed pursuant to president obama’s strategy to reduce methane emissions as part of the administration’s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025 the finalization of these regulations could directly impact mplx by creating delays in the construction and installation of new facilities due to more stringent permitting requirements increasing costs to reduce ghg emissions or requiring aggregation of emissions from separate facilities for permitting purposes these regulations may also impact us by increasing the costs of domestic crude supplies 

in the absence of federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions states may become more active in regulating greenhouse gas emissions these measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions these measures may also include low carbon fuel standards such as the california program in addition private party litigation is pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken these actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented although uncertain these developments could increase our costs reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 

in october 2015 the epa reduced the primary health ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” to 70 ppb from the prior ozone level of 75 ppb the epa is expected to finalize new ozone attainment and nonattainment designations by late 2017 using 20142016 air quality monitor data the lower primary ozone standard may not by attainable in some areas and could result in the cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities or increased costs related to an increase in the production of low reid vapor pressure rvp gasoline 

the eisa establishes increases in fuel mileage standards and contains a second renewable fuel standard commonly referred to as rfs2 increases in fuel mileage standards and the increased use of renewable fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels may reduce demand for refined products governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could also pose a competitive threat to our operations specifically the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 360 billion gallons by 2022 the rfs2 presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use gasoline consumption has been lower than forecasted by the epa which has led to concerns that the renewable fuel volumes may not be met the 2017 renewable fuel standards were finalized and published on november 23 2016 the final standards are lower than the statutory requirements but nevertheless result in volumes that breach the ethanol “blendwall” the advanced biofuels program a subset of the rfs2 requirements creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations 

tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may further reduce refined product margins the tax incentives and subsidies are causing uncertainties because they have expired and been reinstituted retroactively the biodiesel credit for example expired at the end of 2016 and there is uncertainty if it will be reinstituted 

on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts ppm beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm we anticipate that we will spend an estimated 650 million between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards which includes estimated capital expenditures of approximately 200 million in 2017 

federal state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could delay or impede producer’s gas production or result in reduced volumes available for mplx to gather process and fractionate mplx does not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations but it does provide gathering processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by its customers as a result of such operations if federal state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such legal requirements could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase producers’ costs of compliance 

severe weather events may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations 

for a variety of reasons natural andor anthropogenic some members of the scientific community believe that climate changes could occur that could have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts and floods and other climatic events if any such effects were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 

plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies 

our anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets however policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence of environmental and other special interest groups the construction of new refinery processing units or crude oil or refined products pipelines or the extension or expansion of existing assets involve numerous political and legal uncertainties many of which may cause significant delays or cost increases and most of which are beyond our control delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing gross margins 

the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies producing companies and trading companies including suppliers from canada the middle east and various other international locations the market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market we are therefore subject to the attendant political geographic and economic risks of such a market if one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our operations sales of refined products and refining and marketing gross margins could be adversely affected materially and adversely impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products ngls and natural gas additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult andor costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability for example the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products ngls natural gas or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use payroll franchise withholding and property taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for example the us house of representatives republican leadership released a tax reform blueprint proposing the replacement of the current corporate income tax with a destinationbased cash flow tax because the value of our crude oil imports exceed the value of our refined product exports this proposal could have a material adverse effect on our us income tax liabilities additionally many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties 

terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

the us government has issued warnings that energy assets in general including the nation’s refining pipeline and terminal infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations the threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks any future terrorist attacks on our facilities those of our customers and in some cases those of other pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 



 we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are the subject of or a party to a number of pending or threatened legal actions contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters including laws and regulations relating to the environment some of these matters are discussed below 

litigation 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty while it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in may 2015 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against our whollyowned subsidiary marathon petroleum company lp “mpc lp” in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky asserting claims under federal and state antitrust statutes the kentucky consumer protection act and state common law the complaint as amended in july 2015 alleges that mpc lp used deed restrictions supply agreements with customers and exchange agreements with competitors to unreasonably restrain trade in areas within kentucky and seeks declaratory relief unspecified damages civil penalties restitution and disgorgement of profits at this early stage the ultimate outcome of this litigation remains uncertain and neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability if any can be determined and we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss for this matter we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 

in may 2007 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against us and marathon oil in state court in franklin county kentucky for alleged violations of kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws following hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 the lawsuit alleges that we overcharged customers by 89 million during september and october 2005 the complaint seeks disgorgement of these sums as well as penalties under kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws we are vigorously defending this litigation we believe that this is the first lawsuit for damages and injunctive relief under the kentucky emergency pricing laws to progress this far and it contains many novel issues in may 2011 the kentucky attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in april and may 2011 under statewide price controls that were activated by the kentucky governor on april 26 2011 and which have since expired the court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief and the remainder of the 2011 claims likely will be resolved along with those dating from 2005 if the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably in its entirety it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse effect 

environmental proceedings 

the illinois environmental protection agency “iepa” initiated an enforcement action against marathon pipe line llc a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx “mpl” in connection with an april 17 2016 pipeline release to the wabash river near crawleyville indiana mpl responded to a clean water act request for information from the epa in furtherance of its investigation of possible violations arising from the april 17 2016 pipeline release the iepa and the epa may each seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with this matter 

on february 17 2016 markwest liberty bluestone llc a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx “markwest liberty bluestone” received an initial consent agreement and final order “initial cafo” from the epa alleging violations of the clean air act resulting from an epa compliance inspection conducted in july 2012 at our sarsen facility a gas processing facility at our keystone complex located in pennsylvania the alleged violations included the failure to comply with monitoring tagging recordkeeping and repair requirements with respect to certain pumps andor valves at the facility and with certain emissions reduction and permit application requirements the initial cafo set forth a proposed penalty of 285000 after subsequent negotiations markwest liberty bluestone has agreed in principle to a consent agreement and final order resolving these issues pursuant to which markwest liberty bluestone would pay a penalty of 95000 and implement certain enhancements in connection with its existing leak monitoring program 

markwest liberty midstream markwest ohio fractionation company llc “ohio fractionation” and markwest utica emg are in settlement discussions with the epa relating to certain notices of violation alleging claims regarding fugitive emissions and violations of the clean air act at the markwest hopedale complex a fractionation facility located in ohio issued october 7 2015 and june 27 2016 the markwest houston complex a gas processing facility located in pennsylvania issued april 5 2016 and the markwest seneca complex a gas processing facility located in ohio issued september 9 2016 in connection with a proposed global settlement which would cover nineteen gas processing and fractionation sites markwest liberty midstream ohio fractionation and markwest utica emg together with other markwest affiliates have agreed in principle to pay a penalty of approximately 09 million undertake certain monitoring and emission reduction projects at certain facilities with an estimated cost of approximately 33 million and implement certain process enhancements for its and its affiliates’ leak detection and repair programs at the nineteen gas processing and fractionation sites 

in july 2015 representatives from the epa and the united states department of justice conducted a raid on a markwest liberty midstream pipeline launcherreceiver site utilized for pipeline maintenance operations in washington county pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant issued by a magistrate of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania as part of this initiative the us attorney’s office for the western district of pennsylvania proceeded with an investigation of markwest liberty midstream’s launcherreceiver pipeline and compressor station operations in response to the investigation markwest initiated independent studies which demonstrated that there was no risk to worker safety and no threat of public harm associated with markwest liberty midstream’s launcherreceiver operations these findings were supported by a subsequent inspection and review by the occupational safety and health administration after providing these studies and other substantial documentation related to markwest liberty midstreams pipeline and compressor stations and arranging site visits and conducting several meetings with the government’s representatives on september 13 2016 the us attorney’s office for the western district of pennsylvania rendered a declination decision dropping its criminal investigation and declining to pursue charges in this matter 

markwest liberty midstream continues to discuss with the epa and the state of pennsylvania civil enforcement allegations associated with permitting or other related regulatory obligations for its launcherreceiver and compressor station facilities in the region in connection with these discussions markwest liberty midstream received an initial proposal from the epa to settle all civil claims associated with this matter for the combination of a proposed cash penalty of approximately 24 million and proposed supplemental environmental projects with an estimated cost of approximately 36 million markwest liberty midstream will be submitting a response asserting that this action involves novel issues surrounding primarily minor source emissions from facilities that the agencies themselves considered de minimis were not subject to regulation and consequently that the settlement proposal is excessive markwest will continue to negotiate with the epa regarding the amount and scope of the proposed settlement 

during 2001 we entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act and other violations with the epa covering our refineries the settlement committed us to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to our refineries which are now complete based on our satisfaction of obligations under the consent decree on october 31 2016 mpc and the united states department of justice jointly requested termination of the consent decree and on november 29 2016 the us district court for the eastern district of michigan entered an order terminating the consent decree 

we are involved in a number of other environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business while the ultimate outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

executive summary 

results 

select results for 2016  and 2015  are reflected in the following table 



net income attributable to mpc decreased   168 billion  or 305  per diluted share in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to reduced results from our refining  marketing segment 

refining  marketing segment income from operations decreased  in 2016  compared to 2015  segment income in 2015 includes a 345 million noncash charge related to the company’s lcm inventory reserve due to increased refined product prices in 2016 this inventory reserve was completely reversed resulting in a noncash benefit to segment income of 345 million the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance was more than offset by the unfavorable effects of lower crack spreads and higher direct operating costs due to refinery turnarounds 

speedway segment income from operations increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  segment income in 2015 includes a 25 million noncash charge related to the company’s lcm inventory reserve due to increased refined product prices in 2016 this inventory reserve was completely reversed resulting in a noncash benefit to segment income of 25 million in addition to the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance the remaining increase during the year was primarily due to higher merchandise gross margin and gains from asset sales partially offset by lower gasoline and distillate gross margins 

midstream  segment income from operations increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the inclusion of markwest’s operating results following the merger with mplx on december 4 2015 as discussed below as well as earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments 

items not allocated to segments in 2016 includes noncash impairment charges totaling 486 million which included 267 million related to our equity method investment in the sandpiper pipeline project resulting from the indefinite deferral of this project 130 million related to the goodwill recognized in connection with the markwest merger and 89 million related to an mplx equity method investment items not allocated to segments in 2015 includes an impairment charge of 144 million related to the cancellation of the roux project 

mplx lp 

mplx is a diversified growthoriented publicly traded master limited partnership originally formed by us to own operate develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets mplx is engaged in the gathering processing and transportation of natural gas the gathering transportation fractionation storage and marketing of ngls and the gathering transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products on december 4 2015 mplx merged with markwest whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx markwest is engaged in the gathering processing and transportation of natural gas and the gathering transportation fractionation storage and marketing of ngls 

as of december 31 2016  we owned a 255 percent  interest in mplx including a two percent  general partner interest this ownership percentage reflects the conversion of the mplx class b units in july 2017 at 109  to 100 mplx is a vie because the limited partners of mplx do not have substantive kickout or substantive participating rights over the general partner we are the primary beneficiary of mplx because in addition to significant economic interest we also have the power through our 100 percent  ownership of the general partner to control the decisions that most significantly impact mplx we therefore consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 745 percent  interest owned by the public the components of our noncontrolling interest consist of equitybased noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest the redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to mplx’s preferred units discussed below 

the creditors of mplx do not have recourse to mpc’s general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements the assets of mplx are the property of mplx and cannot be used to satisfy the obligations of mpc 

dropdowns to mplx 

on march 1 2014 we sold mplx a 13 percent  interest in mplx pipe line holdings llc “pipe line holdings” for 310 million  mplx financed this transaction with 40 million  of cash onhand and 270 million  of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility 

on december 1 2014 we sold and contributed interests in pipe line holdings totaling 305 percent  to mplx for 600 million  in cash and 29 million  mplx common units valued at 200 million  mplx financed the sales portion of this transaction with 600 million  of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility 

on december 4 2015 we sold our remaining 05 percent  interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for 12 million  as a result mplx now owns 100 percent  of pipe line holdings 

the sales and contribution of our interests in pipe line holdings to mplx resulted in a change of our ownership in pipe line holdings but not a change in control we accounted for these sales as transactions between entities under common control and did not record a gain or loss 

on march 31 2016 we contributed our inland marine business to mplx in exchange for 23 million  common units and 460 thousand  general partner units the number of units we received from mplx was determined by dividing 600 million  by the volume weighted average nyse price of mplx common units for the 10 trading days preceding march 14 2016 pursuant to the membership interests contribution agreement we also agreed to waive firstquarter 2016 common unit distributions idrs and general partner distributions with respect to the common units issued in this transaction the contribution of our inland marine business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss 

on december 5 2016 our board of directors authorized us to offer up to 100 percent of mplx terminals llc “mplx terminals” hardin street transportation llc “hardin street transportation” and woodhaven cavern llc “woodhaven cavern” to mplx mplx terminals owns and operates light products terminals hardin street transportation owns and operates various private crude oil and refined product pipeline systems and associated storage tanks woodhaven cavern owns and operates butane and propane storage caverns the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017 pending requisite approvals 

reorganization transactions 

on september 1 2016 mpc mplx and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify mplx’s ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting in connection with these transactions mpc contributed 225 million  to mplx and all of the issued and outstanding mplx class a units all of which were held by markwest hydrocarbon a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx were exchanged for newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in mplx the simple average of the closing prices of mplx common units for the last 10 trading days prior to september 1 2016 was used for purposes of these transactions as a result of these transactions mpc increased its ownership interest in mplx by 7 million  mplx common units or approximately 1 percent  

private placement of preferred units 

on may 13 2016 mplx completed the private placement of approximately 308 million   65 percent  series a convertible preferred units the “mplx preferred units” at a cash price of 3250  per unit the aggregate net proceeds of approximately 984 million  from the sale of the mplx preferred units was used for capital expenditures repayment of debt and general partnership purposes 

the mplx preferred units rank senior to all mplx common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation the holders of the mplx preferred units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to 0528125  per unit commencing for the quarter ended june 30 2016 with a prorated amount from the date of issuance following the second anniversary of the issuance of the mplx preferred units the holders of the mplx preferred units will receive as a distribution the greater of 0528125  per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common units the mplx preferred units are convertible into mplx common units on a one for one basis after three years at the purchasers’ option and after four years at mplx’s option subject to certain conditions   

the mplx preferred units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside our control therefore they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets we have recorded the mplx preferred units at fair value as of their issuance date net of issuance costs since the mplx preferred units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable that the security would become redeemable 

public offerings 

on december 8 2014 mplx completed a public offering of 35 million  common units at a price to the public of 6668  per mplx common unit with net proceeds of 221 million  mplx used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes 

on february 12 2015 mplx completed an underwritten public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due february 15 2025 the “senior notes” the senior notes were offered at a price to the public of 9964 percent of par the net proceeds of this offering were used to for general corporate purposes including dropdowns 

on february 10 2017 mplx completed a public offering of 125 billion aggregate principal amount of 4125  unsecured senior notes due march 2027 the “mplx 2027 senior notes” and 10 billion  aggregate principal amount of 5200  unsecured senior notes due march 2047 the “mplx 2047 senior notes” mplx intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general partnership purposes which may include from time to time acquisitions including the previously announced planned dropdown of assets from mpc and capital expenditures 

atm program 

on august 4 2016 mplx entered into a second amended and restated distribution agreement the “distribution agreement” providing for the continuous issuance of common units in amounts at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings such continuous offering program or atthemarket program referred to as the “atm program” mplx expects to use the net proceeds from sales under the atm program for general partnership purposes including repayment of debt and funding for acquisitions working capital requirements and capital expenditures 

during 2016  mplx issued an aggregate of 26 million  common units under the atm program generating net proceeds of approximately 776 million  as of december 31 2016  717 million  of common units remains available for issuance through the atm program under the distribution agreement 

distributions from mplx 

the following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from mplx during 2016  and 2015  



the market value of the 866 million  mplx common units we owned at december 31 2016 was 30 billion  based on the december 31 2016 closing unit price of 3462  as mentioned in the strategic actions to enhance shareholder value section above we believe there is substantial value in our economic interests in the general partner of mplx and expect to exchange these economic interests for newly issued mplx common units in conjunction with completion of our dropdowns to highlight and capture that value 

on january 25 2017 mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of 052 per common unit which was payable february 14 2017 as a result mplx made distributions totaling 243 million to its limited and general partners mpc’s portion of this distribution was approximately 102 million 57 million for its general partner interests including idrs and 45 million for its limited partner units

mplx recorded an impairment charge of approximately 129 million in the first quarter of 2016 to impair a portion of the 221 billion of goodwill as adjusted recorded in connection with the markwest merger in the second quarter of 2016 mplx completed its purchase price allocation which resulted in an additional 1 million of impairment expense that would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2016 had the purchase price allocation been completed as of that date this adjustment to the impairment expense was the result of completing an evaluation of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the markwest merger and their impact on the resulting goodwill that was recognized see the critical accounting estimates  impairment assessments of longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity investments section for a discussion of recent circumstances which may impact the assessment of this goodwill our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of markwest operations from the date of the acquisition in the midstream segment 

consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business the markwest merger combines one of the nation’s largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by mpc the complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of markwest mplx and mpc provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain the combined entity will further markwests leading midstream presence in the marcellus and utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions 

on september 30 2014 we acquired from hess all of its retail locations transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines including approximately 40  mbpd on colonial pipeline for 282 billion  we refer to these assets as “hess’ retail operations and related assets” and substantially all of these assets are part of our speedway segment this acquisition significantly expanded our speedway presence from nine  to 22  states throughout the east coast and southeast consistent with our strategy to grow highervalued more stable cash flow businesses this acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations providing an outlet for assured sales from our refining system the transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results for hess’ retail operations and related assets in our speedway segment from the date of the acquisition 

in july 2014 we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in enbridge inc’s sax pipeline which runs from flanagan illinois to patoka illinois this option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the sax pipeline during 2016  we made contributions of 32 million  to illinois extension pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs for the sax project we have contributed 299 million  since project inception the pipeline became operational in december 2015 our investment in the pipeline is included in our midstream  segment 

in march 2014 we acquired from chevron raven ridge pipe line company an additional seven percent  interest in explorer for 77 million  bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent  due to this increase in our ownership percentage we now account for our investment in explorer using the equity method of accounting as part of our midstream segment and report explorer as a related party explorer owns approximately 1900 miles of refined products pipeline from port arthur texas to hammond indiana

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining  marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs 

our refining  marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants we calculate midwest chicago and usgc crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products lls prices and a 6321 ratio of products 6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline 2 barrels of ultralow sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil are used for these crackspread calculations 

our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil the amount of this discount the sweetsour differential can vary significantly causing our refining  marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil in general a larger sweetsour differential will enhance our refining  marketing gross margin 

future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors as well as us energy policy 

the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions   

 in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sweetsour differential and the lls to wti differential our refining  marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as 



 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market costs of crude oil refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values at december 31 2015 costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value resulting in an lcm charge to cost of revenues of 370 million of which 345 million was allocated to our refining  marketing segment as of june 30 2016 market value exceeded cost and we reversed the lcm inventory reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  at december 31 2016  market values for refined products continue to exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

refining  marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs which include turnaround and major maintenance depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs planned major maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years 



the table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at december 31 of each year 



speedway 

our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees impacts the speedway segment profitability gasoline and distillate prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply and demand numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year including local competition seasonal demand fluctuations the available wholesale supply the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions padd 2 estimated 2016 gasoline demand grew for the fourth consecutive year to a record level up 18 percent year over year in 2016 and 12 percent above the former record set in 2006 continuing economic growth and yearonyear declines in prices supported gasoline demand in most of the us more than offsetting fleet fuel efficiency gains estimated gasoline demand in padd 1 however posted a small decline of 01 percent year over year in 2016 as prices increased year over year in the last four months of the yearexacerbated by colonial pipeline disruptions in september and late october distillate demand in 2016 faced enormous headwinds as a much warmer than normal first quarter suppressed heating oil demand and rail traffic total carloads and intermodal fell to a sixyear low for the year padd 1 estimated 2016 distillate demand was down 58 percent year over year to a four year low pulled down by a first quarter that was down nearly 15 percent year over year padd 2 distillate demand is estimated down 20 percent year over year also a four year low the gross margin on merchandise sold at our convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to speedway’s gross margin more than 

half of speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2016  speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items 

inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value costs of crude oil refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values as of december 31 2015 costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value resulting in an lcm charge to cost of revenues of 370 million of which 25 million was allocated to our speedway segment as of june 30 2016 market value exceeded cost and we reversed the lcm inventory reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  as of december 31 2016  market values for refined products continue to exceed their cost basis and therefore there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover 

midstream   

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling volumes by our producer customers such prices also affect midstream segment profitability 

the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations included in our midstream segment primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining  marketing segment the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 



net income attributable to mpc decreased   168 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased 328 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to our refining  marketing segment income from operations which decreased   254 billion  in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 548 million  in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease in income from operations in 2016 for our refining  marketing segment was partially offset by increases in our midstream and speedway segments income from operations for 2016 includes a noncash benefit of 370 million related to the reversal of the company’s lcm inventory valuation reserve and impairment charges of 356 million related to equity method investments and 130 million recorded by mplx to impair a portion of the 221 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger income from operations for 2015 includes a noncash 370 million lcm inventory valuation charge and an impairment charge of 144 million see segment results for additional information 

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes decreased   871 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 2577 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices and sales volumes the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes mpc consolidated refined product sales decreased 32 mbpd in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased 163 mbpd in 2015  compared to 2014  

income loss from equity method investments decreased   273 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 65 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to impairment charges related to equity method investments of 356 million partially offset by increases in income from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investmentsthe 

decrease in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in income from our ethanol affiliates of 69 million mainly due to lower ethanol prices 

net gain on disposal of assets increased   25 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and decreased 14 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the sale of certain speedway locations during the year the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the sale of two terminals and related terminal assets in 2014 

other income increased   66 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of markwest other income and increased rin sales other income in 2015 was comparable to 2014 

cost of revenues decreased   641 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 2819 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to

 purchases from related parties increased   201 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and decreased 197 million  in 2015  compared 2014  the increase in 2016 was primarily due to 

 the decrease in purchases from related parties in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in prices and volumes of ethanol purchases from the andersons marathon ethanol llc the andersons clymers ethanol llc and the andersons albion ethanol llc our affiliated ethanol operations of 149 million decreases in purchases from loop of 36 million and explorer of 19 million 

inventory market valuation adjustment decreased  costs and expenses by 740 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased costs and expenses by 370 million in 2015  compared to 2014  the lcm inventory reserve recorded in 2015 of 370 million was reversed in 2016 due to increases in refined product prices during the second quarter of 2016 resulting in reductions to cost of revenues of 370 million in 2016  

consumer excise taxes decreased   186 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased 101 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in taxable refined product sales volumes and tax rates in certain jurisdictions the increase in 2015 was primarily due to increases in taxable refined product sales volumes including the effects of the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets 

impairment expense decreased   14 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased 144 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  impairment expense in 2016 reflects a 130 million charge recorded by mplx to impair a portion of the 221 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger in 2015 an impairment charge of 144 million was recorded related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery impairments related to equity method investments were recorded to income loss from equity method investments and discussed above 

depreciation and amortization increased   499 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 176 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the markwest merger the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets 

selling general and administrative expenses increased   29 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 201 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of markwest expenses largely offset by decreases in contract services and other selling general and administrative expenses the increase in 2015 was primarily due to increases in employee benefit costs contract services and additional expenses related to the convenience stores acquired from hess along the east coast and southeast partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement expenses 

other taxes increased   44 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of markwest’s taxes other taxes in 2015 were comparable to 2014 

net interest and other financial costs increased   238 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 102 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase in 2016 was primarily due to interest on the debt assumed in the markwest merger the increase in 2015 was primarily due to senior notes issued by mpc in september 2014 to finance the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets higher levels of borrowings on mplx’s bank revolving credit facility used to fund the acquisition of pipe line holdings and interest on the debt assumed from markwest we capitalized interest of 63 million  in 2016  37 million  in 2015  and 27 million  in 2014  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for further details 

provision for income taxes decreased   897 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased 226 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to changes in our income before income taxes which decreased   255 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased 539 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the effective tax rates of 33 percent  34 percent  and 33 percent  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively are slightly less than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences including the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12  for further details 

segment results 

revenues 

revenues are summarized by segment in the following table 



refining  marketing segment revenues decreased   1038 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 2754 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices and volumes the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower product sales prices partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes the table below shows our refining  marketing segment refined product sales volumes and prices 





the table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas 



refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment decreased   144 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased   111 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in average refined product sales prices partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes the increases in 2015 were primarily due to sales to the approximate 1245 convenience stores acquired in september 2014 along the east coast and southeast 



speedway segment revenues decreased   141 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased   276 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in 2016 was due to a decrease  in gasoline and distillate sales of 152 billion  primarily due to a decrease in gasoline and distillate selling prices of 027 per gallon the increase in 2015 was due to increases  in gasoline and distillate sales of 143 billion and merchandise sales of 127 billion the increase in gasoline and distillate sales in 2015 was primarily due to a volume increase of 21 billion gallons driven by an increase in the number of convenience stores as noted in the table below partially offset by a decrease in gasoline and distillate selling prices of 089 per gallon the increase in merchandise sales in 2015 was primarily due to increases in the number of convenience stores and higher same store sales 

the following table includes certain revenue and operating statistics for the speedway segment 



 midstream  segment revenue increased   167 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 140 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increases in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to the inclusion of markwest’s operating results in midstream segment income following the merger with mplx from the december 4 2015 merger date 

the following table shows certain operating statistics for our midstream  segment as well as benchmark prices for natural gas and ngls 



 income from operations 

income from operations and income before income taxes by segment are summarized in the following table 



 refining  marketing segment income from operations decreased   254 billion  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased   548 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  segment income in 2015 includes a 345 million noncash charge related to the company’s lcm inventory reserve which was reversed in 2016 due to increased refined product prices resulting in a noncash benefit to segment income of 345 million the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance was more than offset by the unfavorable effects of lower crack spreads and higher direct operating costs due to refinery turnarounds the increase in 2015 was primarily due to higher crack spreads favorable effects of changes in market structure on crude oil acquisition prices more favorable net product price realizations compared to spot market reference prices and lower direct operating costs these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark lls crude oil the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains and an lcm inventory valuation charge of 345 million 

the following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business 



 based on the market indicators above and our refinery throughputs we estimate the following impacts on refining  marketing segment income from operations for 2016  compared to 2015  and for 2015  compared to 2014  

 the market indicators shown above use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales differences in our results compared to these market indicators including product price realizations the mix of crudes purchased and their costs the effects of lcm inventory valuation adjustments the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances had an estimated negative  impact on refining  marketing segment income of 304 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 103 billion in 2015  compared to 2014  the significant elements of the negative impact for 2016 were unfavorable product price realizations and unfavorable crude acquisition costs relative to the market indicators partially offset by the reversal of the company’s lcm inventory valuation reserve that was recorded in 2015 the significant elements of the negative impact for 2015 were unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to the market indicators the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains the price differential of charge and blend stock relative to crude oil and the lcm inventory valuation charge partially offset by the effects of changes in market structure on our crude oil acquisition costs and product price realizations 

the cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the lifo method in the second quarter of 2016 we had recognized the the effects of an interim liquidation of our refined products inventories which we did not expect to reinstate by year end resulting in a pretax charge of approximately 54 million to income based on year end refined product inventories which were higher than inventories at the beginning of the year we had a build in refined product inventories for 2016 therefore we recognized the effects of this annual build in our refined products in the fourth quarter of 2016 which had the effect of reversing the second quarter charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a lifo charge of 45 million as a result of annual decreased levels in refined products and crude inventory volumes since the lifo costs for these inventory layers were based on 2014 costs the liquidation resulted in a charge to income in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recognized annual builds in our refined product and crude inventories these builds were based on january 2014 costs which were significantly higher than fourth quarter 2014 costs resulting in a benefit of approximately 240 million to income for the full year we recognized a lifo charge of 2 million in 2016 and 78 million  in 2015 as compared to a lifo benefit of 265 million in 2014 

the following table summarizes our refinery throughputs 



the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the refining  marketing segment 



 refinery direct operating costs increased   072  per barrel in 2016  compared to 2015  and decreased 140 per barrel in 2015  compared to 2014  these changes in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014 include an increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of 070  per barrel and a decrease of 067 per barrel respectively as well as decreases in other manufacturing costs of 006  per barrel and 071 respectively the increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2016 are primarily attributable to higher turnaround activity at the galveston bay garyville and robinson refineries and a lower than normal schedule of turnaround activity in 2015 partially offset by a decrease in turnaround activity at the catlettsburg refinery the decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2015 was primarily attributable to lower turnaround activity at the galveston bay robinson and garyville refineries partially offset by an increase in turnaround activity at the detroit refinery in 2016 the decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily due to lower routine maintenance costs general and administrative expenses and waste costs in 2015  the decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to lower energy costs and routine maintenance costs 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 288 million in 2016  212 million in 2015  and 141 million in 2014  in 2015 we recorded a 46 million charge to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance based on the renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015 proposed by the epa in may 2015 and finalized in november 2015 particularly those for biomassbased diesel and advanced biofuels excluding this charge the increases in both years were primarily due to the effect of increased purchases of biomassbased diesel rins at increased prices in 2015 this increase was partially offset by decreased purchases of ethanol rins at decreased prices 

speedway segment income from operations increased   61 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 129 million  in 2015  compared to 2014 segment income in 2015 includes a 25 million noncash charge related to the company’s lcm inventory reserve which was reversed in 2016 due to increased refined product prices resulting in a noncash benefit to segment income of 25 million in addition to the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance the remaining increase during the year was primarily due to higher merchandise gross margin of 67 million  and gains from asset sales partially offset by lower gasoline and distillate gross margin of 91 million or 00167 per gallon the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of 401 million and our merchandise gross margin of 393 million  partially offset by higher operating expenses the increase in 2015 was primarily attributable the full year effect of the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets on september 30 2014 the increases in merchandise gross margin in both years were related to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins 

the following table includes sales volume and gross margin statistics for the speedway segment 



 midstream  segment income from operations increased   491 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 38 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of markwest’s operating results following the merger with mplx as well as earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion of the financial results of markwest which are reflected in midstream segment income from the december 4 2015 markwest merger date partially offset by 30 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition 

corporate and other unallocated expenses decreased   22 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased   22 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in 2016  is primarily due to increased allocations of corporate costs to the segments the increase in 2015 was primarily due to a lower allocation of employee benefit costs to the segments 

unallocated items in 2016 also includes impairment charges of 486 million resulting from noncash charges of 267 million related to the indefinite deferral of the sandpiper pipeline project 130 million related to the goodwill recognized in connection with the markwest merger and 89 million related to an mplx equity method investment unallocated items in 2015 includes an impairment charge of 144 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for additional information on the impairment charges 

we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of 7 million  in 2016  4 million  in 2015  and 96 million  in 2014  resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during these years 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 887 million  at december 31 2016  compared to 113 billion  at december 31 2015  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table 



net cash provided by operating activities decreased   75 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to decreased operating results partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of 122 billion  compared to 2015  net cash provided by operating activities increased 951 million in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to increased operating results partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of 330 million compared to 2014 the above changes in working capital exclude changes in shortterm debt 

for 2016  changes in working capital were a net 200 million  source of cash primarily due to an increase  in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventories changes from december 31 2015  to december 31 2016  per the consolidated balance sheets excluding the impact of acquisitions were as follows 



 for 2015 changes in working capital were a net 102 billion use of cash primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventories accounts payable decreased 192 billion from yearend 2014 primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices and volumes current receivables decreased 113 billion from yearend 2014 primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices and lower crude oil receivable volumes and inventories decreased 47 million from yearend 2014 excluding a 370 million lcm inventory valuation charge primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil inventory volumes 

for 2014 changes in working capital were a net 694 million use of cash primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in inventories partially offset by a decrease in current receivables excluding the impact of acquisitions accounts payable decreased 165 billion from yearend 2013 primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices partially offset by higher crude oil payable volumes inventories decreased 796 million from yearend 2013 primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes and current receivables decreased 163 billion from yearend 2013 primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices

the consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash a reconciliation of additions to property plant and equipment to total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years 



 capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below 



 the markwest merger comprised 85 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments in 2015 the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets comprised 57 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments in 2014 

cash provided by disposal of assets totaled 101 million  21 million  and 27 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively cash provided in 2016 was primarily due the sale of speedway assets in the normal course of business 

net investments were a use of cash of 262 million  in 2016  compared to 327 million  in 2015  and 404 million  in 2014  the change in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily due to decreases in contributions to the sax pipeline project of 114 million the sandpiper pipeline project of 57 million and crowley ocean partners of 38 million partially offset by increases in contributions to crowley coastal partners of 82 million and mplx equity method investments of 74 million the change in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in contributions to the sax pipeline project of 121 million and the 2014 investment in explorer partially offset by contributions to crowley ocean partners of 72 million 

financing activities were a 129 billion  use of cash in 2016  a 987 million  use of cash in 2015  and a 635 million  source of cash in 2014  

longterm debt borrowings and repayments were a net 142 billion  use of cash in 2016  compared to a 746 million  source of cash in 2015  and a 322 billion source of cash in 2014  during 2016 mplx used proceeds from its issuance of the mplx preferred units to repay amounts outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility and mpc chose to prepay 500 million under its term loan during 2015 we used 763 million  of the net proceeds from the issuance of 15 billion of mpc senior notes to extinguish our obligation for the 750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2016 and mplx used proceeds from its issuance of 500 million aggregate of principal amount of mplx senior notes to repay 385 million outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for additional information on our longterm debt

cash used in dividend payments totaled 719 million  in 2016  613 million  in 2015  and 524 million  in 2014  the increases were primarily due to increases in our base dividend partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of share repurchases dividends per share were 136  in 2016  114  in 2015  and 092  in 2014  

cash used in financing activities in all three years included a portion of the payments to the seller of the galveston bay refinery under the contingent earnout provisions of the purchase and sale agreement 

derivative instruments 

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk 

capital resources 

our liquidity totaled 48 billion  at december 31 2016  consisting of 



 because of the alternatives available to us including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets including a commercial paper program we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm and longterm funding requirements including capital spending programs the repurchase of shares of our common stock dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies 

as discussed in the “strategic actions to enhance shareholder value” section in the corporate overview we expect mplx to finance the planned dropdown transactions with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions in the aggregate for all planned dropdowns of assets the equity financing will be funded through mplx common units issued to us in conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns we also expect to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of mplx including incentive distribution rights for newly issued mplx common units cash proceeds from the dropdowns and ongoing mplx common unit distributions to us are expected to fund the substantial ongoing return of capital to mpc shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile 

see discussion of the february 2017 issuance of mplx senior notes due 2027 and 2047 under the mplx lp section of the executive summary 

commercial paper  – on february 26 2016 we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of 2 billion  in commercial paper outstanding with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities at december 31 2016  we had no  amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program 

mpc bank revolving credit facility  – on july 20 2016 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing mpc bank revolving credit facility due in 2017 the new agreement provides for a four year 25 billion  bank revolving credit facility “fouryear revolving credit facility” maturing on july 20 2020  additionally we entered into a 364 day 1 billion  bank revolving credit facility maturing on july 19 2017  the financial covenants contained in these agreements remain the same as under the previous bank revolving credit facility 

our fouryear revolving credit facility includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to 20 billion  and swingline loan capacity of up to 100 million  we may increase our borrowing capacity under our fouryear revolving credit facility by up to an additional 500 million  subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased in addition the maturity date of the fouryear revolving credit facility may be extended for up to two  additional one year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments then outstanding provided that the commitments of any nonconsenting lenders will terminate on the theneffective maturity date 

there were no  borrowings or letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2016  

trade receivables facility  – on july 20 2016 we amended our trade receivables facility to among other things reduce the capacity from 1 billion  to 750 million  and to extend the maturity date to july 19 2019  the reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment 

as of december 31 2016  eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of 684 million  there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31 2016  availability under our trade receivables facility is a function of refined product selling prices 

mplx credit agreement  – mplx is party to a credit agreement dated as of november 20 2014 and amended as of october 27 2015 “mplx credit agreement” providing for a 2 billion  bank revolving credit facility with a maturity date of december 4 2020  and an outstanding 250 million  term loan facility with a maturity date of november 20 2019  

the mplx credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to 250 million  and swingline loan capacity of up to 100 million  the revolving borrowing capacity under the mplx credit agreement may be increased by up to an additional 500 million  subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would increase in addition the maturity date of the bank revolving credit facility may be extended from timetotime during its term to a date that is one year after the theneffective date subject to the approval of lenders holding the majority of the loans and commitments then outstanding provided that the commitments of any nonconsenting lenders will be terminated on the theneffective maturity date 

the maturity date for the term loan facility may be extended for up to two  additional one year periods subject to the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding term loan borrowings provided that the portion of the term loan borrowings held by any nonconsenting lenders will continue to be due and payable on the theneffective maturity date 

during 2016  mplx borrowed 434 million  under the bank revolving credit facility at an average interest rate of 19 percent  per annum and repaid 131 billion  of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2016  mplx had no  borrowings and 3 million  of letters of credit outstanding under the bank revolving credit facility resulting in total unused loan availability of 20 billion  

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for further discussion of our debt 

the term loan agreement the mpc bank revolving credit facility and the mplx credit agreement contain representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types the financial covenant included in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization as defined in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility of no greater than 065 to 100 as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 031  to 100 as well as the other covenants contained in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility 

the mplx credit agreement includes certain representations and warranties affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type the mplx credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the mplx credit agreement for the prior four  fiscal quarters of no greater than 50  to 10 or 55  to 10 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period other covenants restrict mplx and certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens on its assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2016  mplx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement including a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 326  to 10 

our intention is to maintain an investmentgrade credit profile as of january 31 2017 the credit ratings on our and mplx’s senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investmentgrade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

neither the revolving credit facility the mplx credit agreement nor our trade receivables facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investmentgrade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under the revolving credit facility and our trade receivables facility in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investmentgrade levels could under certain circumstances decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements 

debttototalcapital ratio 

our debttototal capital ratio total debt to total debtplusequity was 33  percent and 38  percent at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 



redeemable noncontrolling interest  on may 13 2016 mplx completed the private placement of approximately 308 million   65 percent  series a convertible preferred units the “mplx preferred units” at a cash price of 3250  per unit the mplx preferred units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside mplx’s control therefore they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets we have recorded the mplx preferred units at their issuance date fair value net of issuance costs   

mpc senior notes  – on december 14 2015 we completed a public offering of 15 billion  in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes “mpc senior notes” the net proceeds from the offering of the mpc senior notes were 149 billion  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses we used approximately 763 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the extinguishment of our obligation for the 750 million  aggregate principal amount of our 3500 senior notes due 2016 

the mpc senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 

mplx and markwest senior notes –   in connection with the markwest merger mplx assumed markwest’s outstanding debt which included 41 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes on december 22 2015 approximately 404 billion  aggregate principal amount of markwest’s outstanding senior notes were exchanged for an aggregate principal amount of approximately 404 billion  of new unsecured senior notes issued by mplx in an exchange offer and consent solicitation undertaken by mplx and markwest 

on february 12 2015 mplx completed a public offering of 500 million  aggregate principal amount of four percent  unsecured senior notes due february 15 2025  the net proceeds which were approximately 495 million  after deducting underwriting discounts were used to repay the amounts outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility as well as for general partnership purposes

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity capital resources and results of operations even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the offbalance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources 

we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil these arrangements are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25

our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forwardlooking statements are based on currently available information if this information proves to be inaccurate future availability of financing may be adversely affected factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided by operating activities the state of worldwide debt and equity markets investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance the global financial climate and in particular with respect to borrowings the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies the discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forwardlooking statements regarding expected capital requirements and investment spending costs for projects under construction project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth upgrades and expansion the forwardlooking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance actual results may differ materially from these expectations estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and other 

factors some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include our ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic initiatives discussed herein adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters inability to agree with the mplx conflicts committee with respect to the timing of and value attributed to assets identified for dropdown changes to the expected construction costs and timing of projects continuedfurther volatility in andor degradation of market and industry conditions the availability and pricing of crude oil and other feedstocks slower growth in domestic and canadian crude supply completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the us midwest consumer demand for refined products transportation logistics the reliability of processing units and other equipment mpcs ability to successfully implement growth opportunities modifications to mplx earnings and distribution growth objectives compliance with federal and state environmental economic health and safety energy and other policies and regulations including the cost of compliance with the renewable fuel standard andor enforcement actions initiated thereunder changes to mpcs capital budget other risk factors inherent to mpcs industry these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements for additional information on forwardlooking statements and risks that can affect our business see “disclosures regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

transactions with related parties 

we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7  for discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers for additional information see item 1a risk factors 

our environmental expenditures including nonregulatory expenditures for each of the last three years were 



 we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation or regulations it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for ten  percent nine  percent and five  percent of capital expenditures excluding the markwest merger and the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 422 million  or 12 percent  of total capital expenditures in 2017  predictions beyond 2017  can only be broadbased estimates which have varied and will continue to vary due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies among other matters based on currently identified projects we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately 400 million  in 2018  however actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 

for more information on environmental regulations that impact us or could impact us see item 1 business  – environmental matters item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

 valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 

 impairment assessments of longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions significant assumptions include 

 we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a poor outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes a significant reduction in natural gas or ngls processed a significant reduction in refining margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets site level for speedway segment convenience stores and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream  segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value 

unlike longlived assets goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level we have thirteen reporting units nine of which have goodwill allocated to them at december 31 2016  we had a total of 359 billion  of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

based on an interim goodwill impairment test mplx recorded approximately 130 million of impairment expense related to charges recorded during the first and second quarters of 2016 which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

mpc has nine reporting units with goodwill totaling approximately 359 billion  as of november 30 2016 step 1 of the annual impairment analysis resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 8 percent to 303 percent the reporting unit with fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately 8 percent has goodwill of 228 million at december 31 2016 an increase of 050 percent to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of november 30 2016 significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units’ fair value included estimates of future cash flows if estimates for future cash flows which are impacted primarily by commodity prices and producers’ production plans were to decline the overall reporting units’ fair value would decrease resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges fair value determinations 

require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value at december 31 2016  we had 383 billion  of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

mplx performed a fixed asset impairment analysis during the second quarter of 2016 for ohio condensate company “occ” resulting in an impairment charge of 96 million within occ’s financial statements approximately 58 million of the charge was attributable to mplx based on its 60 percent ownership of occ and was recorded in income loss from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of income furthermore to determine the potential equity method impairment charge an impairment analysis in accordance with asc topic 323 was performed during the second quarter resulting in an additional impairment charge of approximately 31 million recorded in income loss from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

for purposes of the second quarter impairment analysis the fair value of occ was determined based on applying the discounted cash flow method which is an income approach and the guideline public company method which is a market approach the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value under the discounted cash flow method included management’s best estimates of the expected results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and using a discount rate of 112 percent fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as such the fair value of the occ equity method investment and its underlying fixed assets represents a level 3 measurement 

as of december 31 2016 mplx determined that there were no material events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an otherthantemporary decline in its equity method investments 

during the third quarter of 2016 enbridge energy partners announced that its affiliate north dakota pipeline would withdraw certain pending regulatory applications for its sandpiper pipeline project and that the project would be deferred indefinitely these decisions were considered to indicate an impairment of the costs capitalized to date on the project as the operator of north dakota pipeline and the entity responsible for maintaining its financial records enbridge completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of august 31 2016 in accordance with asc topic 360 based on the estimated liquidation value of the fixed assets an impairment charge was recorded by north dakota pipeline based on our 375 percent  ownership of north dakota pipeline we recognized approximately 267 million  of this charge in the third quarter of 2016 through “income loss from equity method investments” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income which impaired virtually all of our 301 million investment in the project also in accordance with asc topic 323 we completed an assessment to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated financial statements resulting from an otherthantemporary impairment the result of this analysis indicated no additional charge was required to be recorded 

the fixed assets of north dakota pipeline related to the sandpiper pipeline project consist primarily of project management and engineering costs pipe valves motors and other equipment land and easements the fair value of fixed assets was estimated based on a market approach using the estimated price that would be received to sell pipe land and other related equipment in its current condition considering the current market conditions for sale of these assets and length of disposal period the valuation considered a range of potential selling prices from various alternatives that could be used to dispose of these assets as such the fair value of the north dakota pipeline equity method investment and its underlying assets represents a level 3 measurement north dakota pipeline expects to dispose of these assets through orderly transactions 

centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2015 at december 31 2016  centennial was not shipping product as a result we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in centennial we concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of centennial’s assets if market conditions were to change and the owners of centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets there could be a future impairment of our centennial interest as of december 31 2016  our equity investment in centennial was 35 million  and we had a 29 million  guarantee associated with 50 percent of centennial’s outstanding debt see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25  for additional information on the debt guarantee 

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to the carrying value of our centennial equity investment factors that could affect the carrying value of our centennial equity investment include but are not limited to a change in business conditions a further decline or improvement in the longterm outlook of the potential uses of centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

acquisitions 

in accounting for business combinations acquired assets assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired if any is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain respectively a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property plant and equipment intangible assets contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and for certain acquisitions engage thirdparty consultants for assistance 

the fair value of assets and liabilities including contingent consideration as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches including the income approach which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate the cost approach which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entityspecific differences the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 

for the customer contract intangibles for our midstream  segment we must estimate the expected life of the relationships with our customers on an individual basis the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 

the fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to bp is remeasured each quarter using an income approach with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues the amount of cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a marketbased crack spread and refinery throughput volumes for the months during which the contract applies as well as established thresholds that cap the annual and total payment we used internal and external forecasts for the crack spread and internal forecasts for refinery throughput volumes and applied an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate to the range of cash flows indicated by various scenarios to determine the fair value of the arrangement see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5  for additional information on our acquisitions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for additional information on fair value measurements 

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

variable interest entities 

we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests variable interests can be contractual ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie’s assets when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated 

significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie we evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest andor if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group we continually monitor our interests in legal 

entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions 

mplx is a vie because the limited partners of mplx do not have substantive kickout or substantive participating rights over the general partner we are the primary beneficiary of mplx because in addition to significant economic interest we also have the power through our 100 percent  ownership of the general partner to control the decisions that most significantly impact mplx we therefore consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 745 percent  interest owned by the public 

markwest utica emg a natural gas and ngl processing joint venture is a vie however we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary as a result it is accounted for under the equity method changes in the design or nature of the activities of this entity or our involvement with the entity may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity’s status as a vie andor our status as the primary beneficiary such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization this could result in the consolidation of the entity which would have a significant impact on our financial statements ohio gathering is a subsidiary of markwest utica emg and is a vie if we were to consolidate markwest utica emg ohio gathering would need to be assessed for consolidation or deconsolidation 

variable interest entities are discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6   

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  to be updated 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 

 we utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuary’s discount rate model this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 390 percent for our pension plans and 425 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 44 million and 26 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 3 million and 1 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 51 percent equity securities and 49 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness we used the 650 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2016 defined benefit pension expense after evaluating activity in the capital markets along with the current and projected plan investments we did not change the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 650 percent effective for 2017 decreasing the 650 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 4 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

we utilized the 2016 mortality tables from the us society of actuaries 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22  includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

contingent liabilities 

we accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions claims litigation environmental remediation tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and thirdparty indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable we regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons for instance settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes which are recorded as other taxes for additional information on contingent liabilities see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – environmental matters and compliance costs 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

as discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3  to our audited consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2016  we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 17  and 18  for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

refining  marketing 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also authorize the use of the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below lifo inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

midstream 

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond mplx’s control mplx’s profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at its own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by mplx’s producer customers such prices also affect profitability to protect mplx financially against adverse price movements and to maintain more stable and predictable cash flows so that it can meet its cash distribution objectives debt service and capital plans mplx executes a strategy governed by its risk management policy mplx has a committee comprised of senior management that oversees risk management activities continually monitors the risk management program and adjusts its strategy as conditions warrant derivative contracts utilized for crude oil natural gas and ngls are swaps and options traded on the otc market and fixed price forward contracts as a result of mplx’s current derivative positions it believes that it has mitigated a portion of its expected commodity price risk through the fourth quarter of 2017 mplx would be exposed to additional commodity risk in certain situations such as if producers under‑deliver or over‑deliver products or if processing facilities are operated in different recovery modes in the event that mplx has derivative positions in excess of the product delivered or expected to be delivered the excess derivative positions may be terminated 

mplx management conducts a standard credit review on counterparties to derivative contracts and it has provided the counterparties with a guaranty as credit support for its obligations a separate agreement with certain counterparties allows markwest liberty midstream to enter into derivative positions without posting cash collateral mplx uses standardized agreements that allow for offset of certain positive and negative exposures in the event of default or other terminating events including bankruptcy 

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the table below sets forth information relating to our significant open commodity derivative contracts as of december 31 2016  

  



a   987 percent  of exchangetraded contracts expire in the first quarter of 2017  

b   100 percent  of exchangetraded contracts expire in the first quarter of 2017  

c  chicago mercantile exchange “cme” 

d  intercontinental exchange “ice” 

e  reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending “rbob” 

sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2016  is provided in the following table 



we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2016  would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations related to our debt obligations at december 31 2016  our debt was primarily comprised of the 225 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued february 1 2011 the 195 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued september 5 2014 the 500 million  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mplx senior notes issued february 12 2015 the 150 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued december 15 2015 and the 404 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mplx senior notes issued december 22 2015 additionally we have 450 million  of variable rate term debt 

sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint change in interest rates on longterm debt as of december 31 2016  is provided in the following table fair value of cash and cash equivalents receivables accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the shortterm maturity of the instruments accordingly these instruments are excluded from the table 

  



 at december 31 2016  our portfolio of longterm debt was comprised of fixedrate instruments and variablerate borrowings under the term loan agreement and the mplx term loan facility the fair value of our fixedrate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixedrate debt at prices above carrying value interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the term loan agreement the mplx term loan facility and mplx bank revolving credit facility but may affect our results of operations and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2016  

counterparty risk 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment by our customers to whom we provide services or sell natural gas or ngls we believe that certain contracts would allow us to pass those losses through to our customers thus reducing our risk when we are selling ngls and acting as our producer customers’ agent our credit exposure related to these customers is represented by the value of our trade receivables where exposed to credit risk we analyze the customer’s financial condition prior to entering into a transaction or agreement establish credit terms and monitor the appropriateness of these terms on an ongoing basis in the event of a customer default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by counterparties or future commission merchants our credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date these outstanding instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements should the creditworthiness of one or more of our counterparties decline our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party in the event of a counterparty default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted this counterparty credit risk does not apply to our embedded derivative as the overall value is a liability we regularly review the creditworthiness of counterparties and futures commission merchants and enter into master netting agreements when appropriate 

forwardlooking statements 

these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forwardlooking statements with respect to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to interest rates as well as market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil other refinery feedstocks refined products natural gas ngls and ethanol if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements

 item 1 business 

overview 

marathon petroleum corporation “mpc” has 128  years of experience in the energy business with roots tracing back to the formation of the ohio oil company in 1887 we are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining marketing retail and transportation businesses in the united states and the largest east of the mississippi with the merger of mplx lp “mplx” the midstream master limited partnership sponsored by mpc and markwest energy partners lp “markwest” effective december 4 2015 the “markwest merger” we believe we are one of the largest natural gas processors in the united states and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing speedway and midstream  each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 10  for operating segment and geographic financial information which is incorporated herein by reference 

corporate history and structure 

mpc was incorporated in delaware on november 9 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of marathon oil corporation “marathon oil” on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its refining marketing  transportation business “rmt business” into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil common stock on june 30 2011 the “spinoff” following the spinoff marathon oil retained no ownership interest in mpc and each company has separate public ownership boards of directors and management all subsidiaries and equity method investments not contributed by marathon oil to mpc remained with marathon oil and together with marathon oil are referred to as the “marathon oil companies” on july 1 2011 our common stock began trading “regularway” on the nyse under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

recent developments 

on december 4 2015 a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx the midstream master limited partnership sponsored by mpc merged with markwest whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the markwest merger was converted into a right to receive 109 common units of mplx representing limited partner interests in mplx plus a onetime cash payment of 620  per unit each class b unit of markwest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one class b unit of mplx having substantially similar rights including conversion and registration rights and obligations that the class b units of markwest had immediately prior to the merger at closing we contributed 123 billion in cash to mplx to pay the cash consideration to markwest common unitholders we will contribute an additional total of 50 million in cash to mplx for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the mplx class b units to mplx common units in equal installments in july 2016 and july 2017 respectively these contributions are with respect to mpc’s existing interests in mplx including idrs and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in mplx our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of markwest from the date of the acquisition 

consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business the markwest merger combines one of the nation’s largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by mpc the complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of markwest mplx and mpc provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain the combined entity will further markwests leading midstream presence in the marcellus and utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions in addition the combination provides significant vertical integration opportunities as mpc is a large consumer of ngls

mplx lp 

mplx is a publicly traded master limited partnership formed by us to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on december 4 2015 mplx merged with markwest whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx 

prior to the markwest merger we owned a 715 percent  interest in mplx which included our two percent  general partner interest each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding at the time of the markwest merger was converted into the right to receive 109 common units of mplx and as of december 31 2015  our ownership interest in mplx was 204 percent  including our two percent  general partner interest due to our general partner interest we have determined that we control mplx and therefore we consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 796 percent  interest owned by the public 

upon completion of the markwest merger mplx assumed an aggregate principal amount of 41 billion in senior notes issued by markwest and markwest energy finance corporation the “markwest senior notes” on december 22 2015 mplx completed offers to exchange any and all outstanding markwest senior notes for 1 up to 41 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes issued by mplx having the same maturity and interest rates as the markwest senior notes and 2 cash of 1 for each 1000 of principal amount exchanged as of december 31 2015 the exchange was completed on all the markwest senior notes except for 16 percent or 63 million 

mplx’s initial assets consisted of a 51 percent  general partner interest in mplx pipe line holdings llc “pipe line holdings” which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states and a 100 percent  interest in a butane storage cavern in west virginia we originally retained a 49 percent limited partner interest in pipe line holdings 

on may 1 2013 we sold a five percent  interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for 100 million  which was financed by mplx with cash onhand 

on march 1 2014 we sold a 13 percent  interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for 310 million  mplx financed this transaction with 40 million  of cash onhand and 270 million  of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility

our competitive strengths 

high quality refining gathering and processing assets 

we believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the midwest and the fourth largest in the united states based on crude oil refining capacity we own a seven plant refinery network with approximately 18  mmbpcd of crude oil throughput capacity our refineries process a wide range of crude oils feedstocks and condensate including heavy and sour crude oils which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates specialty chemicals and other refined products while we have historically processed significant quantities of heavy and sour crude oils our refineries have the ability to process approximately 65 percent to 70 percent light sweet crude oils 

through our ownership interests in mplx and its whollyowned subsidiary markwest we believe we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the united states and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas ngls and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets our midstream gathering and processing operations include natural gas gathering processing and transportation and ngl gathering transportation fractionation storage and marketing our assets include approximately 5400  mmcfd of gathering capacity 7100  mmcfd of natural gas processing capacity and 500  mbpd of fractionation capacity as of december 31 2015  

strategic locations 

the geographic locations of our refineries provide us with strategic advantages located in padd ii and padd iii which consist of states in the midwest and the gulf coast regions of the united states our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources including domestic canadian and other foreign sources which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs for example geographic proximity to various united states shale oil regions and canadian crude oil supply sources allows our refineries access to priceadvantaged crude oils and lower transportation costs than certain of our competitors our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access refined product export markets and to serve a broad range of key enduser markets across the united states quickly and costeffectively 

our midstream  segment assets are similarly located in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states which collectively comprised approximately 73 percent of total united states crude distillation capacity and approximately 53 percent of total united states finished products demand for the year ended december 31 2015  according to the eia mplx through markwest its whollyowned subsidiary is the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions this significantly compliments and creates strategic opportunities for our refining  marketing segment and mplx’s logistic assets in the same geographic footprint 

    

 extensive midstream distribution networks 

our assets give us extensive flexibility and optionality to respond promptly to dynamic market conditions including weatherrelated and marketplace disruptions we believe the relative scale of our transportation and distribution assets and operations distinguishes us from other refining and marketing companies we currently own lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8400  miles of crude oil and products pipelines additionally we have over 5000 miles of natural gas and ngl pipelines we also own one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the united states as well as trucking and rail assets we operate this system in coordination with our refining and marketing network which enables us to optimize feedstock and other raw material supplies and refined product distribution and further allows for important economies of scale across our system 

general partner and sponsor of mplx 

our investment in mplx should allow us to enhance our share price through our limited partner and general partner interests which tend to receive higher market multiples mplx also provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets mplx’s liquidity and access to the capital markets should provide us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream business our role as the general partner allows us to maintain strategic control of the assets so we can continue to optimize our refinery feedstock and distribution networks 

we have an extensive portfolio of midstream assets that can potentially be sold andor contributed to mplx at valuations that are supportive to the partnership’s growth providing mplx with a competitive advantage as of december 31 2015  these assets included 

 8 

 we continue to focus resources on growing this portfolio of midstream assets including investments in the sandpiper pipeline project the recently completed sax pipeline and our new marine joint venture crowley ocean partners we broadly estimate these assets and growth projects can generate annual ebitda of 16 billion in addition to this growing portfolio by which we can also incubate projects for mplx we also have the ability to provide additional financial flexibility to the partnership through intercompany debt and equity financing commercial arrangements idr givebacks and other alternatives see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on these midstream assets 

competitively positioned marketing operations 

we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area we have two strong retail brands speedway ®  and marathon ®  we believe speedway llc a whollyowned subsidiary operates the second largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states with approximately 2770  convenience stores in 22  states throughout the midwest east coast and southeast the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states comprised of approximately 5600  retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19  states as of december 31 2015  in addition as part of the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets in 2013 and hess’ retail operations and related assets in 2014 we obtained retail marketing contracts that provide us with the opportunity to convert the associated retail outlets to the marathon brand as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding retail marketing contract assignments for approximately 300  retail outlets we believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost 

attractive growth opportunities 

we believe we have attractive growth opportunities across all of our business segments 

we recently announced a 2 billion multiyear project we are undertaking in our refining  marketing segment which will fully integrate our galveston bay and texas city refineries increase residual oil processing revamp a crude unit to increase our overall crude processing capacity increase our distillate and gas oil recovery improve the unit’s reliability and install a new ulsd hydrotreater allowing the refinery to produce 100 ulsd and ulsk we refer to this group of projects as the south texas asset repositioning “star” program our refining  marketing segment is also investing in the midstream through our ocean vessel equity affiliate which is constructing additional jones act product tankers to move finished products from our refineries to the coastal market 

our speedway segment is focused on store remodels to enhance profitability particularly for its acquired stores along the east coast building new locations in speedway’s core market and fully integrating hess’ retail operations and related assets 

mplx which is included in the midstream  segment is focused on organic growth opportunities for natural gas gathering and processing and ngl gathering and fractionation in the marcellus and utica shale formations among other regions mplx also remains focused on the cornerstone pipeline project and related utica build out projects the cornerstone project is the building block for the other projects that will become a critical solution for the industry to move condensate and ngls out of the utica region into refining centers in northwest ohio and into canada our midstream  segment’s investments also include an investment in an equity interest in the sandpiper pipeline project that will transport crude oil from growing north american hydrocarbon production regions to our refineries 

in connection with the markwest merger we have also identified a portfolio of potential projects totaling 6 billion to 9 billion of incremental investment opportunities for our midstream  segment over the next several years these investment opportunities are in the early stages of feasibility analysis and include projects in the utica and marcellus shale regions that could leverage our respective capabilities and pursue natural commercial synergies and transportation solutions to open new markets for producers’ products in these shale regions 

established track record of profitability and diversified income stream 

we have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the refining cycle we believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results income generated by our speedway segment which was significantly expanded with the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets is less sensitive to business cycles and income from our midstream  segment which was significantly expanded through the markwest merger is more stable due to its longterm fee based contracts while our refining  marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable 

strong financial position 

as of december 31 2015  we had 113 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and 317 billion  in unused committed borrowing facilities excluding mplx’s credit facilities we had 1193 billion  of debt at yearend which represented 38  percent of our total capitalization this combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage provides financial flexibility to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies 

our business strategies 

maintain toptier safety and environmental performance 

we remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations we have a history of safe and reliable operations which was demonstrated again in 2015 with a solid performance compared to the industry average four of our refineries and five additional facilities have earned designation as an osha vpp star site in addition we remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency and reliability of our operations we proactively address our regulatory requirements and encourage our operations to improve their environmental performance through our dei program the results of the 2015 dei program show a 16 percent reduction over 2014 in regards to significant environmental incidents across mpc which includes our major operating components 

grow higher valued stable cash flow businesses 

we intend to continue allocating significant capital to grow our midstream and retail businesses exclusive of acquisitions these businesses typically have more predictable and stable income and cash flows compared to our refining operations and we believe investors assign a higher value to businesses with stable cash flows 

mplx is an important part of the mpc strategy to grow its higher valued stable cash flow midstream businesses and the markwest merger significantly expanded its midstream activities to include natural gas gathering processing and transportation and ngl gathering transportation fractionation storage and marketing mplx will evaluate organic growth projects within its geographic footprint including the marcellus and utica shale regions oklahoma and texas as well as in new areas that provide attractive returns and cash flows mplx may pursue these opportunities as standalone projects with mpc or other parties 

we significantly expanded speedway’s presence along the east coast and southeast through our acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets towards the end of 2014 we intend to continue growing speedway’s sales and profitability by focusing on the conversion and integration of these acquired locations from which we expect to realize increased merchandise sales and other synergies we also remain focused on organic growth through remodeling stores constructing new stores rebuilding old stores acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions and improving margins at our existing operations we have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market pennsylvania and tennessee as well as growth opportunities in georgia south carolina and the florida panhandle we also plan to capitalize on diesel demand growth by building out our commercial fueling lane network in addition our highly successful speedy rewards ®  customer loyalty program which averaged more than 47 million  active members in 2015  provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our speedway customer base with existing and new speedway locations including the stores acquired from hess 

maintain longterm integrated relationships with our producer customers 

mplx’s markwest subsidiary has developed longterm integrated relationships with its producer customers these relationships are characterized by an intense focus on customer service and a deep understanding of producer customers’ requirements coupled with the ability to increase the level of our midstream services in response to their midstream requirements through collaborative planning mplx continues to construct highquality midstream infrastructure and provide unique solutions that are critical to the ongoing success of producer customers’ development plans as a result of delivering highquality midstream services markwest has been the toprated midstream service provider since 2006 as determined by an independent research provider 

deliver top quartile refining performance 

our refineries are well positioned to benefit from the growing crude oil and condensate production in north america including the bakken eagle ford and utica shale regions along with the canadian oil sands we are also well positioned to export distillates gasoline and other products 

we intend to enhance our margins in the refining  marketing segment by realizing benefits of continuous process improvements investing in and optimizing operations at our galveston bay and texas city refineries increasing distillate yield and conversion capacity and growing refined product export capacity for example we completed condensate splitter projects at our canton and catlettsburg refineries to increase our condensate capacity we increased distillate production at our galveston bay and robinson refineries and expanded our export capacity at our galveston bay and garyville refineries we intend to create a worldclass refining complex by investing 2 billion in our galveston bay refinery over the next five years the group of projects included in this investment will enable us to produce 100 percent ulsd and ulsk increase our overall crude processing capacity increase our distillate and gas oil recovery and improve the refinery’s reliability furthermore this investment program will fully integrate our galveston bay and texas city refineries in 2016 we intend to increase our capacity to produce high value products such as alkylate and light products by making investments in the fcc units at our garyville and detroit refineries we also intend to further increase distillate production at our garyville refinery and to further expand the export capacity at our galveston bay refinery 

sustain focus on shareholder returns 

we intend to continue our focus on the return of capital to shareholders in the form of a strong and growing base dividend supplemented by share repurchases since becoming a standalone company in june 2011 our dividend has increased by a 295 percent compound annual growth rate and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling 10 billion  through open market purchases and two asr programs we repurchased 198 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 724 billion  representing approximately 28  percent of our outstanding common shares when we became a standalone company in june 2011 after the effects of these repurchases 276 billion  of the 10 billion  total authorization was available for future repurchases as of december 31 2015  

increase assured sales volumes at our marathon brand and speedway locations 

we consider assured sales as those sales we make to marathon brand customers our speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts we believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations between our refineries pipelines and terminals the marathon brand has been a vehicle for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets our speedway operations have also enabled us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations with its expansion from nine to 22  states throughout the east coast and southeast in 2014 

utilize and enhance our high quality employee workforce 

we utilize our high quality employee workforce which was augmented with the addition of markwest’s employees to mpc by continuing to leverage our commercial skills in addition we continue to enhance our workforce through selective hiring practices and effective training programs on safety environmental stewardship and other professional and technical skills

we have blended ethanol into gasoline for more than 20 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007 in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline were 85  mbpd in 2015  78  mbpd in 2014  and 74  mbpd in 2013  we sell reformulated gasoline which is also blended with ethanol in 12  states in our marketing area we also sell biodieselblended diesel fuel in 16  states in our marketing area the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol and biodiesel blending programs will be driven by market economics and government regulations 

propane  we produce propane at most of our refineries propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers 

feedstocks and special products  we are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and specialty products product availability varies by refinery and includes platformate alkylate fcc unit gas naptha dry gas propylene raffinate butane benzene xylene molten sulfur cumene and toluene we market these products domestically to customers in the chemical agricultural and fuelblending industries in addition we produce fuelgrade coke at our garyville detroit and galveston bay refineries which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications and anodegrade coke at our robinson refinery which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry our feedstocks and special products sales decreased to 258 mbpd in 2015 from 268 mbpd in 2014 and increased in 2014 from 214 mbpd in 2013 the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to higher turnaround activity in 2014 resulting in more available feedstocks more feedstocks used in production versus selling them on the spot market and market conditions in 2015 the increase in 2014 was primarily due to our galveston bay refinery 

heavy fuel oil  we produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components including slurry at all of our refineries heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering fuel industries though there are other more specialized uses of the product 

asphalt  we have refinerybased asphalt production capacity of up to 101  mbpcd which includes asphalt cements polymermodified asphalt emulsified asphalt industrial asphalts and roofing flux we have a broad customer base including asphaltpaving contractors government entities states counties cities and townships and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers we sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail barge and vessel 

terminals 

as of december 31 2015  we owned and operated 61  light product and 18  asphalt terminals our light product and asphalt terminals averaged 1410  mbpd and 32  mbpd of throughput in 2015  respectively in addition we distribute refined products through one  leased light product terminal two  light product terminals in which we have partial ownership interests but do not operate and approximately 120  thirdparty light product and two  thirdparty asphalt terminals in our market area the following table sets forth additional details about our owned and operated terminals at december 31 2015  



transportation  marine truck and rail 

as of december 31 2015  our marine transportation operations included 18  owned and one  leased towboat as well as 205  owned and 14  leased barges that transport refined products and crude oil on the ohio mississippi and illinois rivers and their tributaries and intercoastal waterways we also have a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture with crowley maritime corporation through our investment in crowley ocean partners to operate and charter four new jones act product tankers most of which will be leased to mpc as of december 31 2015  two of the four vessels were delivered with the remaining two vessels expected to be delivered by the third quarter of 2016 the following table sets forth additional details about our tankers barges and towboats 



 as of december 31 2015  we owned 173  transport trucks and 174  trailers with an aggregate capacity of 16 million  gallons for the movement of refined products and crude oil in addition we had 2189  leased and 21  owned railcars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of refined products the following table sets forth additional details about our railcars 



speedway 

our speedway segment sells gasoline diesel and merchandise through convenience stores that it owns and operates under the speedway brand we are substantially complete with the conversion of the remaining convenience stores acquired from hess to the speedway brand and plan to complete this process by the end of the second quarter of 2016 speedway convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items speedway’s speedy rewards® loyalty program has been a highly successful loyalty program since its inception in 2004 with a consistently growing base which averaged more than 47 million  active members in 2015  due to speedway’s ability to capture and analyze memberspecific transactional data speedway is able to offer the speedy rewards® members discounts and promotions specific to their buying behavior we believe speedy rewards® is a key reason customers choose speedway over competitors and it continues to drive significant value for both speedway and our speedy rewards® members 

the demand for gasoline is seasonal with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel merchandise margin as a percent of total gross margin for speedway decreased in 2015 primarily due to higher light product margins during the year and the effects of the convenience stores acquired from hess the following table sets forth speedway merchandise statistics for the past three years 



as of december 31 2015  speedway had 2766  convenience stores in 22  states the following table sets forth the number of convenience stores by state owned by our speedway segment as of december 31 2015  



a  includes travel centers and stores with commercial fueling lanes 

as of december 31 2015  speedway owned 105  transport trucks and 83  trailers for the movement of gasoline and distillate 

midstream   

following the markwest merger we changed the name of our pipeline transportation segment to the midstream  segment to reflect its expanded business activities the midstream  segment includes the operations of mplx which transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas gathers processes and transports natural gas and transports fractionates stores and markets ngls as of december 31 2015  we owned leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8400  miles of crude oil and products pipelines of which approximately 2900  miles are owned through our investments in mplx also through our investments in mplx we own 5000 miles of gas gathering and ngl pipelines and have ownership interests in over 50 gas processing plants over 10 ngl fractionation facilities and one condensate stabilization facility 

mplx 

mplx is a publicly traded master limited partnership formed by us to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on december 4 2015 mplx merged with markwest whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx prior to the markwest merger we owned a 715 percent  interest in mplx which included our two percent  general partner interest as of december 31 2015  our ownership interest in mplx was 204 percent  including our two percent  general partner interest 

as of december 31 2015  mplx assets through its combination with markwest included approximately 5400  mmcfd of gathering capacity 7100  mmcfd of natural gas processing capacity and 500  mbpd of ngl fractionation capacity and more than 5000 miles of gas gathering and ngl pipelines 

mplx assets as of december 31 2015  also included 100 percent ownership of common carrier pipeline systems through marathon pipe line llc “mpl” and ohio river pipe line llc “orpl” and a one million  barrel butane storage cavern in west virginia mplx through mpl and orpl owned or leased and operated 1008  miles of common carrier crude oil lines and 1900  miles of common carrier products lines located in nine  states and four  tank farms in illinois and indiana with available storage capacity of 453 million  barrels that is committed to mpc in 2015  third parties generated 17  percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on mplx’s common carrier pipelines excluding volumes shipped by mpc under joint tariffs with third parties these common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the mplx pipeline throughput information in the table below for each of the last three years 

mpcretained assets and investments 

we retained ownership interests in several crude oil and products pipeline systems and pipeline companies mpc consolidated volumes transported through our common carrier pipelines which include mplx and our undivided joint interests are shown in the mpc consolidated pipeline throughput information in the following table for each of the last three years 

the following table shows operating statistics for our midstream  segment 



 the locations and detailed information about our midstream assets are included under item 2 properties and are incorporated herein by reference 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products based upon the “the oil  gas journal 2015  worldwide refinery survey” we ranked fourth among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity as of december 31 2015  we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale spot branded and retail distribution we believe we compete with about 55  companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers about 100  companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market 12  refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded independent entrepreneurs and approximately 890  retailers in the retail sale of refined products in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and retail consumers we do not produce any of the crude oil we refine 

we also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their independent entrepreneurs and other wellrecognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers often selling gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise at competitive prices nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into sales of retail gasoline and diesel fuel energy analysts international inc estimated such retailers had approximately 13  percent of the us gasoline market in mid 2015  

our midstream  operations face competition for natural gas gathering crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services in obtaining unprocessed ngls for gathering and fractionation and in marketing our products and services competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants operating efficiency and reliability and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of capacity proximity to supply and industry marketing centers and cost efficiency and reliability of service competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and ngls is based primarily on price delivery capabilities flexibility and maintenance of highquality customer relationships in addition certain of our midstream  operations are highly regulated which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils wti and lls crude oils and other market structure differentials also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

our midstream  segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and ngls and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year in the northeast region we could be particularly impacted by seasonality as the majority of its revenues are generated by ngl sales however we manage the seasonality impact through the execution of our marketing strategy we have access to up to 50 million gallons of propane storage capacity in the northeast region provided by an arrangement with a thirdparty which provides us with flexibility to manage the seasonality impact overall our exposure to the seasonal fluctuations in the commodity markets is declining due to our growth in feebased business 

environmental matters 

our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for reviewing our overall environmental performance we also have a corporate emergency response team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review discussion or implementation the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant for additional information see item 1a risk factors we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products additionally we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable 

our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment such laws and regulations include among others the clean air act “caa” with respect to air emissions the clean water act “cwa” with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized 

for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air water solid waste and remediation see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters and compliance costs 

air 

we are subject to many requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations internationally and domestically emphasis has been placed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions the us pledge in 2009 as part of the copenhagen accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect and was reaffirmed in the president’s 2013 climate action plan the 2015 paris agreement on climate change does not legally require parties to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but the united states’ future activities in response to the paris agreement are unknown in 2009 the epa issued an “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to the endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles the endangerment finding the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act resulted in permitting of greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources but as a result of the epa’s “tailoring rule” permit applicability was limited to larger sources such as refineries legal challenges were filed against these epa actions in june 2014 the united states supreme court ruled that the clean air act prevention of significant deterioration program for new and modified stationary sources is not triggered by greenhouse gas emissions alone the united states supreme court did however uphold the requirement for new or modified stationary sources that will also emit a criteria pollutant to control greenhouse gas emissions through best available control technology implementing best available control technology may result in increased costs to our operations a few mpc projects triggered greenhouse gas permitting requirements but any additional capital spending will likely not be significant 

the epa has finalized source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions for new and existing electric utility generating units these standards could impact electric and natural gas rates for all our operations legal challenges have been filed by several states and by industry groups seeking to overturn the final rules congress may again also consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax private parties have sued utilities and other emitters of greenhouse gas emissions but such suits have been largely unsuccessful we have not been named in any of those lawsuits private parties have also sued federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken in sum requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments these requirements may also significantly affect mpc’s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the extent and magnitude of the impact from greenhouse gas regulation or legislation cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 

in 2013 the obama administration made changes to the social cost of carbon “scc” estimate the scc was first issued in 2010 the scc is to be used by the epa and other federal agencies in regulatory costbenefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases in 2013 the obama administration significantly increased the estimate to 36 per ton in response to the regulated community and congress’ critiques of how the scc was developed the office of management and budget provided an opportunity to comment on the scc but ultimately did not make any significant revisions in december 2014 the white house council on environmental quality issued new draft guidance for assessing greenhouse gas emissions under the national environmental policy act adding for the first time language that requires the analyses to also include the impact of climate change on projects including using the scc when analyzing costs and benefits of a project while the impact of a higher scc in future regulations is not known at this time it may result in increased costs to our operations 

in 2015 the epa finalized a revision to the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for ozone the epa lowered the primary ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to 70 ppb this revision initiates a multiyear process in which nonattainment designations will be made based on more recent ozone measurements that includes data from 2016 states will then propose 

and adopt as necessary new rules reducing emissions to meet the new standard currently the epa is in the process of implementing the 75 ppb ozone standard that the epa had promulgated in march 2008 the impact of a stricter standard cannot be accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding area nonattainment designations and the additional requirements that states may impose additionally legal petitions challenging the revised ozone standard have been filed with the court adding uncertainty to the revised standard 

on september 29 2015 the epa signed the final regulations revising existing refinery air emissions standards the revised regulations were published in the federal register on december 1 2015 the revised rule requires additional controls lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring we do not anticipate that mpc’s costs to comply with the revised regulations will be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other things requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances also in case of any such release opa90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages opa90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements 

additionally opa90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be doublehulled and that existing tank vessels that are not doublehulled be retrofitted or removed from us service all barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the doublehulled requirements of opa90 we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

in june 2015 the epa and the united states army corps of engineers finalized significant changes to the definition of the term “waters of the united states” “wotus” used in numerous programs under the cwa this final rulemaking is referred to as the clean water rule the clean water rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts by many states trade groups and other interested parties and in october 2015 a united states court of appeals issued a nationwide stay of the clean water rule the clean water rule as written expands permitting planning and reporting obligations and may extend the timing to secure permits for pipeline and fixed asset construction and maintenance activities the clean water rule does contain new language intended to address concerns that the proposed rule included storm water conveyances and storage structures as wotus and we continue to review how that new language will apply under specific circumstances court challenges of the clean water rule will continue through 2016 

in 2015 the epa issued its intent to review the cwa categorical effluent limitation guidelines “elg” for the petroleum refining sector during 2016 the epa will prepare and request significant wastewater and treatment process details for our refining operations the epa has indicated they believe there have been significant changes in the characteristics of wastewaters generated within refining operations that warrant the review specific targets for the review are the impacts of processing heavier crude oils and the transfer of air pollutants to wastewater when air pollution abatement devices are in use a similar project initiated in 2007 for steam power generation with similar attributes resulted in a significant change in the treatment requirements for coal fired power plants the refining sector elg review has the potential to result in a similar impact we are actively engaged in the planning process for the 2016 information request and engaged with api and afpm on this matter the typical lifecycle for an elg review from the intent to review to issuance of a final rule that would require upgrades is seven years 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of usts containing regulated substances we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at two of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite thirdparty treatment and disposal facilities ongoing rcrarelated costs however are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain convenience stores and other locations where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the applicable state laws and regulations a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

mileage standards renewable fuels and other fuels requirements 

in 2007 the us congress passed the energy independence and security act “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 and contains the rfs2 in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking new or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations 

the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 1815 billion gallons in 2014 205 billion gallons in 2015 2225 billion gallons in 2016 and increase to 360 billion gallons by 2022 within the total volume of renewable fuel eisa established an advanced biofuel volume of 375 billion gallons in 2014 55 billion gallons in 2015 725 billion gallons in 2016 and increasing to 210 billion gallons in 2022 subsets within the advanced biofuel volume include biomassbased diesel which was set as at least 10 billion gallons in 2014 through 2022 to be determined by the epa through rulemaking and cellulosic biofuel which was set at 175 billion gallons in 2014 30 billion gallons in 2015 425 billion gallons in 2016 and increasing to 160 billion gallons in 2022 

on november 30 2015 the epa finalized the renewable fuel standards for the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 as well as the biomass based diesel standard for 2017 because the epa missed the statutory deadlines for establishing the standards for 2014 and 2015 the epa set the standards using actual consumption data obtained from epa’s tracking system emts the volumes in billions of gallons that were finalized are as follows 



these volumes with the exception of biomass based diesel represent a reduction from the statutory volumes in the near term the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline vehicle regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline “e10” the volumes for 2016 result in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the e10 blendwall which will require obligated parties to either sell e15 or flexfuel at levels that exceed historical levels neither e15 nor flexfuel has been readily accepted by the consumer there are numerous issues including state and federal regulatory issues which need to be addressed before e15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines 

with potentially uncertain supplies the advanced biofuels programs may present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels including biomassbased diesel and cellulosic biofuel 

we made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel rfs2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product and by buying needed biodiesel rins in the epacreated biodiesel rins market on april 1 2014 we purchased a facility in cincinnati ohio which currently produces biodiesel glycerin and other byproducts the capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million  gallons per year as a producer of biodiesel we now generate rins thereby reducing our reliance on the external rin market 

on october 13 2010 the epa issued a partial waiver decision under the caa to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from e10 to e15 for 2007 and newer lightduty motor vehicles on january 21 2011 the epa issued a second waiver for the use of e15 in vehicles model year 20012006 there are numerous issues including state and federal regulatory issues which need to be addressed before e15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines 

there will be costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in eisa and related regulations the rfs2 has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 

on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm we anticipate that we will spend an estimated 750 million to 1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards a majority of which is expected to be spent in the years of 2017 through 2019

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate while others relate to the ownership of our common stock 

our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business 

a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products the measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil or crack spread is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins historically refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions any overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins many of the factors influencing a change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control these factors include 

 some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce which may reduce our revenues income from operations and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures impair the carrying value of our assets such as property plant and equipment inventory or goodwill decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages severe weather labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as acts of terrorism for example pipelines provide a nearlyexclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries in such instances a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including but not limited to explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

we rely on the performance of our information technology systems the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and network infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems involve data network and telecommunications internet access and website functionality and various computer hardware equipment and software applications including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business these systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters software viruses or other malware power failures cyberattacks and other events we also face various other cybersecurity threats including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans there can be no guarantee such plans to the extent they are in place will be effective 

the retail market is diverse and highly competitive and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business 

we face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices several nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business these nontraditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow because of their diversity integration of operations experienced management and greater financial resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market in addition these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts adversely affecting our profit margins additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the development availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred 

we have significant debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

at december 31 2015  our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were 125 billion  including 57 billion  of obligations of mplx we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

 a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money andor limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to 10 billion depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables in periods of lower prices we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations including liabilities assumed by mplx in the markwest merger and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in 

litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 36 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements certain hourly employees at our canton catlettsburg galveston bay and texas city refineries are represented by the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that are due to expire in 2019 the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees at our detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is also scheduled to expire in 2019 in addition they represent certain hourly employees at speedway under agreements that cover certain outlets in new york and new jersey that expire between on march 14 2016 and june 30 2016 these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us in addition we have experienced or may experience work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership mplx which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain levels we could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920 which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens among other requirements to establish citizenship corporations that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by us citizens if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although the spinoff occurred in mid2011 certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil however if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries whether accruing before on or after the spinoff we also agreed to be responsible for and indemnify marathon oil with respect to all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff or certain internal restructuring transactions failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368a and 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation warranty covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement in addition we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified taxrelated liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities at this time we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts the tax liabilities described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

the spinoff could be determined not to qualify as a taxfree transaction and marathon oil and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify marathon oil for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

marathon oil received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spinoff qualifies as taxfree to marathon oil us and marathon oil stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a and related provisions of the code if the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect then marathon oil would not be able to continue to rely on the ruling we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations that were relied on in the private letter ruling to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect if notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling the spinoff were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code marathon oil would be subject to tax as if it had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares 

with respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed on marathon oil in connection with the spinoff and certain related transactions as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences as set forth in the private letter ruling we would be liable to marathon oil under the tax sharing agreement for any such taxes or liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us any of our affiliates or any person that after the spinoff is our affiliate we may be similarly liable if we breach specified representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement if we are required to indemnify marathon oil for taxes incurred as a result of the spinoff or certain related transactions being taxable to marathon oil it would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have potential liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil in connection with the spinoff that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions that were required to affect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves if marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and commercial synergies that are anticipated from the markwest merger 

the benefits that are expected to result from the markwest merger will depend in part on mplx’s ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and commercial synergies as a result of the markwest merger mplx’s success in realizing these growth opportunities and commercial synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of mplx and markwest there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as markwest the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of mplx and markwest members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company maintain relationships with employees customers or suppliers attract new customers and develop new strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that mplx will successfully or costeffectively integrate markwest the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if mplx is able to integrate markwest successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and commercial synergies that we currently expect from this integration and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all for example mplx may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover mplx may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of markwest while it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve commercial synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the markwest merger may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the businesses 

significant acquisitions in the future will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows  

in addition to the markwest merger significant future transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks which may include among others 

 a significant decrease or delay in oil and natural gas production in mplx’s areas of operation whether due to sustained declines in oil natural gas and ngl prices natural declines in well production or otherwise may adversely affect mplx’s business results of operations and financial condition and could reduce mplx’s ability to make distributions to us 

a significant portion of mplx’s operations are dependent upon production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells which will naturally decline over time which means that mplx’s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of mplx’s facilities mplx must continually obtain new oil natural gas ngl and refined product supplies which depends in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities 

we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of mplx’s operations the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline in addition we have no control over producers or their production decisions which are affected by among other things prevailing and projected energy prices drilling costs per mcf or barrel demand for hydrocarbons operational challenges access to downstream markets the level of reserves geological considerations governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital because of these factors even if new oil or natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by mplx assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves if mplx is not able to obtain new supplies of oil or natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells throughput on mplx pipelines and the utilization rates of mplx facilities would decline which could have a material adverse effect on mplx’s business results of operations and financial condition and could reduce mplx’s ability to make distributions to us 

decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves the prices for oil natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond our control including global and local demand production levels changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications imports and exports seasonality and weather conditions economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations sustained periods of low prices could result in producers also significantly curtailing or limiting their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil gas and ngls to mplx’s facilities and adversely affect mplx’s revenues and cash available for distribution to us this impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of mplx’s commoditybased contracts which are more directly impacted by changes in gas and ngl prices than its feebased contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a btu equivalent basis than ngl products in addition mplx’s purchase and resale of gas and ngls in the ordinary course exposes mplx to significant risk of volatility in gas or ngl prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of mplx’s production processes the significant fluctuation and decline in natural gas ngl 

and oil prices currently occurring has adversely impacted mplx’s unit price thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital such impacts could adversely impact mplx’s ability to execute its long‑term organic growth projects satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels and may also result in noncash impairments of longlived assets or goodwill or otherthantemporary noncash impairments of our equity method investments 

risks relating to our industry 

changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following 

 the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

because the issue of climate change continues to receive scientific and political attention there is the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations the us pledge in 2009 as part of the copenhagen accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect and was reaffirmed in the president’s 2013 climate action plan the 2015 paris un climate change conference agreement aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels the paris agreement does not legally require parties to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but the us’s future activities in response to the paris agreement may result in regulations to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

in october 2015 the epa finalized regulations to reduce carbon emissions from new modified and reconstructed power plants new source performance standards and from existing power plants existing source performance standards also known as the clean power plan through the regulations the epa is requiring a reduction in nationwide carbon emissions from the power generation sector by 32 percent below 2005 levels these standards could increase our electricity costs and potentially reduce the reliability of our electricity supply in february 2016 the us supreme court stayed implementation of the clean power plan until the legal challenge filed by several states and industry could be heard by the courts 

the obama administration has also developed the social cost of carbon “scc” which is to be used by the epa and other federal agencies in regulatory costbenefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases the scc was first issued in 2010 in 2013 the obama administration significantly increased the estimate to 36 per ton in response to the regulated community and congress’ critiques of how the scc was developed the office of management and budget “omb” provided an opportunity to comment on the scc in july 2015 the omb issued a response to comments and a revised technical support document explaining adjustments to the scc calculations additionally in december 2014 the white house council on environmental quality issued new draft guidance for assessing greenhouse gas emissions under the national environmental policy act adding for the first time language that requires that analyses also include the impact of climate change on projects including using the scc when analyzing costs and benefits of a project while the impact of a higher scc in future regulations is not known at this time it may result in increased costs to our operations 

an article on the social cost of methane has also been published and was used by the epa in its regulatory impact analysis of the proposed emission standards for new and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector these regulations were proposed pursuant to president obama’s strategy to reduce methane emissions as part of the administration’s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025 the finalization of these regulations could directly impact mplx by creating delays in the construction and installation of new facilities due to more stringent permitting requirements increasing costs to reduce ghg emissions or requiring aggregation of emissions from separate facilities for permitting purposes these regulations may also impact us by increasing the costs of domestic crude supplies 

in the future congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax other measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review or implementation in the us these measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions private party litigation is pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken these actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented although uncertain these developments could increase our costs reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 

in october 2015 the epa reduced the primary health ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” to 70 ppb from the prior ozone level of 75 ppb the epa is expected to finalize new ozone attainment and nonattainment designations by late 2017 using 20142016 air quality monitor data the lower primary ozone standard may not by attainable in some areas and could result in the cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities or increased costs related to an increase in the production of low reid vapor pressure rvp gasoline 

the eisa establishes increases in fuel mileage standards and contains a second renewable fuel standard commonly referred to as rfs2 increases in fuel mileage standards and the increased use of renewable fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels may reduce demand for refined products governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could also pose a competitive threat to our operations specifically the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 360 billion gallons by 2022 the rfs2 presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use gasoline consumption has been lower than forecasted by the epa which has led to concerns that the renewable fuel volumes may not be met the 2014 2015 and 2016 renewable fuel standards were finalized and published on december 14 2015 the final standards are lower than the statutory requirements but nevertheless result in volumes that breach the ethanol “blendwall” the advanced biofuels program a subset of the rfs2 requirements creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations 

tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may further reduce refined product margins 

on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts ppm beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm we anticipate that we will spend an estimated 750 million to 1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards 

federal state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could delay or impede producer’s gas production or result in reduced volumes available for mplx to gather process and fractionate mplx does not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations but it does provide gathering processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by its customers as a result of such operations if federal state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such legal requirements could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase producers’ costs of compliance 

severe weather events may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations 

for a variety of reasons natural andor anthropogenic some members of the scientific community believe that climate changes could occur that could have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts and floods and other climatic events if any such effects were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 

plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies 

our anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets however policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence of environmental and other special interest groups the construction of new refinery processing units or crude oil or refined products pipelines or the extension or expansion of existing assets involve numerous political and legal uncertainties many of which may cause significant delays or cost increases and most of which are beyond our control delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing gross margins 

the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies producing companies and trading companies including suppliers from canada the middle east and various other international locations the market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market we are therefore subject to the attendant political geographic and economic risks of such a market if one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our operations sales of refined products and refining and marketing gross margins could be adversely affected materially and adversely impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products ngls and natural gas additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult andor costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability for example the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products ngls natural gas or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use payroll franchise withholding and property taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties 

terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

the us government has issued warnings that energy assets in general including the nation’s refining pipeline and terminal infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations the threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks any future terrorist attacks on our facilities those of our customers and in some cases those of other pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the recent lifting of the us crude oil export ban could adversely affect crack spreads or crude oil price differentials and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

since the 1970s the us has restricted the ability of producers to export domestic crude oil in december 2015 us lawmakers passed legislation to lift the crude oil export ban the lifting of the crude oil export ban may cause the price of domestic crude oil to rise potentially impacting crack spreads and price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils a deterioration of crack spreads or price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 

 38 

 we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are the subject of or a party to a number of pending or threatened legal actions contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters including laws and regulations relating to the environment some of these matters are discussed below 

litigation 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty while it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in july 2015 a purported class action lawsuit asserting claims challenging the markwest merger was filed in the court of chancery of the state of delaware by a purported unitholder of markwest in august 2015 two similar putative class action lawsuits were filed in the court of chancery of the state of delaware by plaintiffs who purport to be unitholders of markwest on september 9 2015 these lawsuits were consolidated into one action pending in the court of chancery of the state of delaware now captioned in re markwest energy partners lp unitholder litigation  on october 1 2015 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint against the individual members of the board of directors of markwest energy gp llc the “markwest gp board” mplx mplx gp llc the general partner of mplx “mplx gp” mpc and sapphire holdco llc a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx asserting in connection with the markwest merger and related disclosures that among other things i the markwest gp board breached its duties in approving the markwest merger with mplx and ii mpc mplx mplx gp and sapphire holdco llc aided and abetted such breaches on february 4 2016 the court approved a stipulation and proposed order to dismiss all claims with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs but for the court to retain jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for a mootness fee by the plaintiffs’ counsel for an award of attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of expenses we intend to vigorously defend against any application for a mootness fee and do not expect the resolution of such matter to have a material adverse effect 

in may 2015 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against our whollyowned subsidiary marathon petroleum company lp “mpc lp” in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky asserting claims under federal and state antitrust statutes the kentucky consumer protection act and state common law the complaint as amended in july 2015 alleges that mpc lp used deed restrictions supply agreements with customers and exchange agreements with competitors to unreasonably restrain trade in areas within kentucky and seeks declaratory relief unspecified damages civil penalties restitution and disgorgement of profits at this early stage the ultimate outcome of this litigation remains uncertain and neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability if any can be determined and we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss for this matter we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 

in may 2007 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against us and marathon oil in state court in franklin county kentucky for alleged violations of kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws following hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 the lawsuit alleges that we overcharged customers by 89 million during september and october 2005 the complaint seeks disgorgement of these sums as well as penalties under kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws we are vigorously defending this litigation we believe that this is the first lawsuit for damages and injunctive relief under the kentucky emergency pricing laws to progress this far and it contains many novel issues in may 2011 the kentucky attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in april and may 2011 under statewide price controls that were activated by the kentucky governor on april 26 2011 and which have since expired the court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief and the remainder of the 2011 claims likely will be resolved along with those dating from 2005 if the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably in its entirety it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse effect 

environmental proceedings 

on february 17 2016 markwest liberty bluestone llc a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx “markwest liberty bluestone” received a draft consent agreement and final order “cafo” from the epa alleging violations of the clean air act arising from an epa compliance inspection conducted in july 2012 at our sarsen facility a gas processing facility located in pennsylvania this inspection occurred shortly after markwest liberty bluestone had acquired the facility from a third party and we were already conducting an internal selfassessment audit the cafo alleges certain violations including the failure to comply with monitoring tagging recordkeeping and repair requirements with respect to certain pumps andor valves at the facility the alleged violations also include the failure to comply with certain emissions reduction and permit application requirements the cafo sets forth a proposed civil penalty of 285078 markwest liberty bluestone believes there are substantial defenses and disputable issues regarding the alleged claims and the proposed penalty as set forth in the cafo and markwest liberty bluestone will be asserting those defenses and issues in discussions with the epa

in january 2016 the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq issued an enforcement notice to mpc lp indicating mdeq intends to pursue enforcement for two violation notices issued to mpc lp in 2015 the violation notices both allege exceedances of air emissions limitations at our detroit refinery it is possible the mdeq could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with this matter 

on july 6 2015 officials from the epa and the united states department of justice entered a pipeline launcherreceiver site utilized for pipeline pigging operations in washington county pennsylvania of markwest liberty midstream  resources llc a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx “markwest liberty midstream” pursuant to a search warrant issued by the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania at the conclusion of the search the governmental officials presented markwest liberty midstream with a subpoena to provide documents related to the design construction operation maintenance modification inspection assessment repair of andor emissions from markwest liberty midstream’s pipeline facilities located in pennsylvania markwest liberty midstream is providing information in response to the subpoena and related requests for information from the relevant agencies and is in discussions with the relevant agencies regarding issues associated with the search and subpoena and its operations of or supplementary permitting obligations for its pipeline facilities in the northeast immediately following the july 6 2015 search markwest liberty midstream commenced its own assessment of its operations of launcherreceiver facilities markwest liberty midstream’s review to date has determined that other than potentially having to obtain minor source permits at a relatively small number of individual sites markwest liberty midstream’s operations have been conducted in a manner fully protective of its employees and the public and in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations it is possible that in connection with any potential civil or criminal enforcement action associated with this matter markwest liberty midstream will incur material assessments penalties or fines incur material defense costs and expenses be required to modify our operations or construction activities which could increase operating costs and capital expenditures or be subject to other obligations or restrictions that could restrict or prohibit our activities any or all of which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows the amount of any potential assessments penalties fines requirements modifications costs or expenses that may be incurred in connection with any potential enforcement action cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

on march 21 2014 markwest liberty midstream received a draft consent order from the west virginia department of environmental protection wvdep incorporating 16 separate inspections in 2013 of various operations and construction sites with claimed regulatory violations relating to erosion and sediment control measures damage in 2013 to a portion of the marcellus ngl pipeline in wetzel county west virginia which resulted from landslides and associated issues pipeline borings and other disparate matters the draft consent order aggregated those matters and proposed a total aggregate administrative penalty of 115120 for all of the various alleged claims as well as the development of an approved remediation plan and certain provisions for approval of pipeline boring plans and other construction related activities in west virginia going forward markwest liberty midstream and wvdep entered into a final consent order resolving all alleged violations which became effective on november 2 2015 pursuant to the final consent order markwest liberty midstream paid a penalty of 76450 and submitted a corrective action plan to the wvdep and will periodically provide the wvdep with information relating to slips impacting or having the potential to impact waters of the state of west virginia 

on january 3 2013 the louisiana department of environmental quality “ldeq” issued a consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty alleging violations related to selfreported air emission events occurring at our garyville louisiana refinery between the years of 2005 and 2011 in january 2016 we settled this matter with ldeq by agreeing to reimburse ldeq for 27500 in costs incurred and pay 765000 to fund a beneficial environmental project the settlement also resolved selfreported events occurring during 2012 and 2013 

during 2001 we entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act and other violations with the epa covering our refineries the settlement committed us to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to our refineries which are now complete we are working with the epa to terminate the new source review consent decree 

we are involved in a number of other environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business while the ultimate outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

executive summary 

results 

select results for 2015  and 2014  are reflected in the following table 



net income attributable to mpc increased   328 million  or 087  per diluted share in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to our refining  marketing segment 

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to higher crack spreads favorable effects of changes in market structure on crude oil acquisition prices more favorable net product price realizations compared to spot market reference prices and lower direct operating costs these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark lls crude oil the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains and a lower of cost or market “lcm” inventory valuation charge of 345 million 

speedway segment income from operations increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to the full year benefit in 2015 from the financial results of the locations acquired along the east coast and southeast on september 30 2014 as well as higher light product margin 

midstream  segment income from operations increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to the financial results of markwest which are reflected in midstream segment income from the december 4 2015 merger date partially offset by 30 million of merger transaction costs 

mplx lp 

mplx is a publicly traded master limited partnership that was formed by us to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on december 4 2015 mplx merged with markwest whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx 

prior to the markwest merger we owned a 715 percent  interest in mplx which included our two percent  general partner interest each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding at the time of the markwest merger was converted into the right to receive 109 common units of mplx and as of december 31 2015  our ownership interest in mplx was 204 percent  including our two percent  general partner interest due to our general partner interest we have determined that we control mplx and therefore we consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 796 percent  interest owned by the public 

upon completion of the markwest merger mplx assumed an aggregate principal amount of 41 billion in senior notes issued by markwest and markwest energy finance corporation on december 22 2015 mplx completed offers to exchange any and all outstanding markwest senior notes for 1 up to 41 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes issued by mplx having the same maturity and interest rates as the markwest senior notes and 2 cash of 1 for each 1000 of principal amount exchanged as of december 31 2015 the exchange was completed on all the markwest senior notes except for 16 percent or 63 million in addition markwest’s existing credit facility was terminated and the approximately 943 million  outstanding under markwest’s bank revolving credit facility was repaid with 850 million  of borrowings under mplx’s bank revolving credit facility and 93 million  in cash 

mplx’s initial assets consisted of a 51 percent  general partner interest in pipe line holdings which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states and a 100 percent  interest in a butane storage cavern in west virginia we originally retained a 49 percent limited partner interest in pipe line holdings 

on may 1 2013 we sold a five percent  interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for 100 million  which was financed by mplx with cash on hand 

on march 1 2014 we sold a 13 percent  interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for 310 million  mplx financed this transaction with 40 million  of cash onhand and 270 million  of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility 

on december 1 2014 we sold and contributed interests in pipe line holdings totaling 305 percent  to mplx for 600 million  in cash and 29 million  mplx common units valued at 200 million  mplx financed the sales portion of this transaction with 600 million  of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility 

the sales and contribution of our interests in pipe line holdings to mplx resulted in a change of our ownership in pipe line holdings but not a change in control we accounted for these sales as transactions between entities under common control and did not record a gain or loss 

on december 8 2014 mplx completed a public offering of 35 million  common units at a price to the public of 6668  per common unit with net proceeds of 221 million  mplx used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes on december 10 2014 we exercised our right to maintain our two percent general partner interest in mplx by purchasing 130 thousand  general partner units for 9 million  

on february 12 2015 mplx completed an underwritten public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due february 15 2025 the senior notes were offered at a price to the public of 9964 percent of par the net proceeds of this offering were used by mplx to repay the amounts outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility as well as for general partnership purposes 

on december 4 2015 we sold our remaining 05 percent  interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for 12 million  as a result mplx now owns 100 percent of pipe line holdings 

distributions from mplx 

upon payment of the secondquarter distribution the financial tests required for conversion of all of the mplx subordinated units which were owned by a subsidiary of mpc were met accordingly the subordinated units converted into common units on a oneforone basis effective august 17 2015 the first business day following the payment of the second quarter distribution 

the following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from mplx during 2015  and 2014  



the market value of the 569 million  mplx common units we owned at february 12 2016 was 104 billion  based on the february 12 2016 closing unit price of 1830  over time we also believe there will be substantial value attributable to our two percent general partnership interest 

on january 25 2016 mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of 050 per common unit which was payable february 12 2016 mpc’s portion of this distribution was approximately 70 million 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 4  for additional information on mplx 

acquisitions and investments 

on december 4 2015 mplx merged with markwest whereby markwest became a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the markwest merger was converted into a right to receive 109 common units of mplx representing limited partner interests in mplx plus a onetime cash payment of 620  per unit each class b unit of markwest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one class b unit of mplx having substantially similar rights including conversion and registration rights and obligations that the class b units of markwest had immediately prior to the merger at closing we contributed 123 billion in cash to mplx to pay the cash consideration to markwest common unitholders we will contribute an additional total of 50 million in cash to mplx for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the mplx class b units to mplx common units in equal installments in july 2016 and july 2017 respectively these contributions are with respect to mpc’s existing interests in mplx including idrs and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in mplx we assigned the total consideration transferred of 86 billion including the 73 billion fair value of the equity consideration and the 13 billion of cash contributions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interest assumed in the markwest merger with the excess recorded as goodwill as a result we recognized total assets acquired of 116 billion including 84 billion of property plant and equipment and 25 billion of equity investments and total liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed of 55 billion including 46 billion of assumed debt the excess of the total consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired of 25 billion was recorded as goodwill in our midstream segment goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances see the critical accounting estimates  impairment assessments of longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity investments section for a discussion of recent circumstances which may impact the assessment of this goodwill our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of markwest from the date of the acquisition 

consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business the markwest merger combines one of the nation’s largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by mpc the complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of markwest mplx and mpc provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain the combined entity will further markwests leading midstream presence in the marcellus and utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions in addition the combination provides significant vertical integration opportunities as mpc is a large consumer of ngls 

in september 2015 we acquired a 50 percent  ownership interest in a new joint venture with crowley maritime corporation through our investment in crowley ocean partners which is included in our refining  marketing segment the joint venture will operate and charter four  new jones act product tankers most of which will be leased to mpc contributions to the joint venture with respect to each vessel will occur at the vessel’s delivery during 2015 we contributed 72 million  in connection with delivery of the first two vessels the remaining two vessels are expected to be delivered by the third quarter of 2016 we account for our ownership interest in crowley ocean partners as an equity method investment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 25  for information on our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of the joint venture and future contributions to crowley ocean partners 

on september 30 2014 we acquired from hess all of its retail locations transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines including approximately 40  mbpd on colonial pipeline for 282 billion  we refer to these assets as “hess’ retail operations and related assets” and substantially all of these assets are part of our speedway segment this acquisition significantly expands our speedway presence from nine  to 22  states throughout the east coast and southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow highervalued stable cash flow businesses this acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations providing an outlet for assured sales from our refining system the transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results for hess’ retail operations and related assets from the date of the acquisition 

in july 2014 we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in enbridge inc’s sax pipeline which runs from flanagan illinois to patoka illinois this option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the sax pipeline and our commitment to the sandpiper pipeline project as discussed below during 2015  we made contributions of 147 million  to illinois extension pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs for the sax project we have contributed 267 million  since project inception the pipeline became operational in december 2015 our investment in the pipeline is included in our midstream  segment 

on april 1 2014 we purchased a facility in cincinnati ohio from felda iffco sdn bhd malaysia for 40 million  the plant currently produces biodiesel glycerin and other byproducts the capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million  gallons per year 

in march 2014 we acquired from chevron raven ridge pipe line company an additional seven percent  interest in explorer for 77 million  bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent  due to this increase in our ownership percentage we now account for our investment in explorer using the equity method of accounting and report explorer as a related party explorer owns approximately 1900 miles of refined products pipeline from lake charles louisiana to hammond indiana 

in november 2013 we agreed with enbridge energy partners to serve as an anchor shipper for the sandpiper pipeline which will run from beaver lodge north dakota to superior wisconsin we also agreed to fund 375 percent  of the construction of the sandpiper pipeline project which is currently estimated to cost 26 billion of which approximately 10 billion is our share we made contributions of 71 million  during 2015  and have contributed 287 million  since project inception in exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in enbridge energy partners’ north dakota system when the sandpiper pipeline is placed into service the anticipated inservice date for the pipeline is likely to be delayed to early 2019 the project schedule and cost estimates remain under review enbridge energy partners’ north dakota system currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long we will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements

as of december 31 2015  we had cash and cash equivalents of 113 billion  and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our 25 billion  bank revolving credit facility or 10 billion  trade receivables securitization facility as of december 31 2015  eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of 668 million  under the trade receivable securitization facility mplx had 877 million  of borrowings outstanding under its 2 billion  revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2015  

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to the estimated construction costs timing and completion of the sandpiper project and the share repurchase authorizations factors that could affect the estimated construction costs timing and completion of the sandpiper pipeline project include but are not limited to availability of materials and labor unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and thirdparty approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include but are not limited to business conditions availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining  marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs 

our refining  marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil 

commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants we calculate midwest chicago and usgc crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products lls prices and a 6321 ratio of products 6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline 2 barrels of ultralow sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil are used for these crackspread calculations 

refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like brent crude in recent years domestic us crude oils such as wti and lls have traded at prices less than brent due to the growth in us crude oil production logistical constraints and other market factors these price discounts had favorably impacted the lls 6321 crack spread the decline in crude oil prices in 2015 has led to declines in sequential month on month onshore us crude oil production and narrowed the lls discount to brent with less near term production growth and the end of the ban on us crude oil exports lls and brent are expected to trade near parity 

our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil the amount of this discount the sweetsour differential can vary significantly causing our refining  marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil in general a larger sweetsour differential will enhance our refining  marketing gross margin 

future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors as well as us energy policy 

the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions   

 in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sweetsour differential and the discount of wti to lls our refining  marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as 

 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market costs of crude oil refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the lifo cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values at december 31 2015  market values for these inventories which totaled approximately 40 billion gallons were lower than their lifo cost basis and as a result we recorded an inventory valuation charge of 345 million to cost of revenues to value these inventories at the lower of cost or market based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover in 2016 inventory market values have continued to decline and if they do not recover to december 31 2015  levels by march 31 2016 an additional inventory valuation charge would be required in first quarter 2016 

in the fourth quarter 2015 we recorded a lifo charge of 45 million as a result of decreased levels in refined products and crude inventory volumes since the lifo costs for these layers were based on 2014 costs the liquidation of these layers resulted in a charge to income in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recognized builds in our refined product and crude inventories these builds were based on 2014 costs which were significantly higher than fourth quarter 2014 costs and resulted in a benefit of approximately 240 million to income for the full year we recognized a lifo charge of 78 million in 2015 as compared to a lifo benefit of 265 million in 2014 

refining  marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs which include turnaround and major maintenance depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs planned major maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years 



the table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at december 31 of each year 



speedway 

our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees impacts the speedway segment profitability numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year including local competition seasonal demand fluctuations the available wholesale supply the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions gasoline demand in padd 2 is estimated to have grown for the third consecutive year increasing by 23 percent in 2015 and approaching 2007 levels after climbing by 05 percent in 2014 meanwhile gasoline demand in padd 1 is estimated to have grown by 30 percent in 2015 after a 24 percent increase in 2014 returning to 2010 levels continuing economic growth and yearonyear declines in prices supported gasoline demand distillate demand in 2015 was softer than the very strong levels in 2014 which were supported by severe winter temperatures and a very strong harvest season padd 2 distillate demand is estimated to have declined by 28 percent in 2015 after climbing by 43 percent to a record level in 2014 despite this decline padd 2 demand is estimated to have remained near prerecession highs padd 1 estimated distillate demand declined 11 percent for 2016 with unseasonably warm weather in november and december after climbing by 49 percent in 2014 market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize the gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to speedway’s gross margin more than half of speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2015  speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market at december 31 2015  market values for refined product inventories were lower than their lifo cost basis and as a result we recorded an inventory valuation charge of 25 million to cost of revenues to value these inventories at the lower of cost or market based on movements of refined product prices future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect to earnings such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover in 2016 inventory market values have continued to decline and if they do not recover to december 31 2015  levels by march 31 2016 an additional inventory valuation charge would be required in first quarter 2016 

midstream   

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control our profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers such prices also affect profitability 

the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining  marketing segment the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 



net income attributable to mpc increased   328 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 412 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to our refining  marketing segment income from operations which increased 577 million  in 2015 compared to 2014 and 403 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in refining  marketing segment income from operations in 2015  was  primarily due to higher crack spreads favorable effects of changes in market structure on crude oil acquisition prices more favorable net product price realizations compared to spot market reference prices and lower direct 

operating costs these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark lls crude oil the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains and an lcm inventory valuation charge of 345 million  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher usgc and chicago crack spreads partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs 

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes decreased   2577 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 234 billion  in 2014  compared to 2013  the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumesthe decrease in 2014 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes and higher merchandise sales for our speedway segment primarily attributable to the convenience stores acquired along the east coast and southeast mpc consolidated refined product sales increased 163 mbpd in 2015  compared to 2014  and 52 mbpd in 2014  compared to 2013  

income from equity method investments decreased   65 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 117 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in income from our ethanol affiliates of 69 million mainly due to lower ethanol prices the increase in 2014 was primarily due to increases in income from our ethanol affiliates of 68 million and income from our pipeline affiliates of 49 million the increase in income from our ethanol affiliates includes the affects of our acquisition of interests in taae tace and taei in august 2013 the higher income from our pipeline affiliates is primarily due to increases from loop and explorer which is now accounted for as an equity method investment following our acquisition of an increased ownership interest in this pipeline company 

net gain on disposal of assets decreased   14 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 15 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to the sale of two terminals and terminal assets in 2014 

other income increased   1 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 59 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  other income in 2015 was comparable to 2014 the increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher gains on sales of excess rins of 74 million partially offset by an 11 million impairment in 2014 of an investment in a company accounted for using the cost method 

cost of revenues decreased   2819 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  and decreased 363 billion  in 2014  compared to 2013  the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to 

  the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to 

 purchases from related parties decreased   197 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 148 million  in 2014  compared 2013  the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in prices and volumes of ethanol purchases from tame tace and taae of 149 million decreases in volumes purchased from loop of 36 million and decreases in volumes purchased from explorer of 19 million the increase in 2014 was primarily due to acquisitions of ownership interests in taae in august 2013 and explorer in march 2014 resulting in purchases from these companies totaling 118 million in 2014 and 24 million in 2013 being reported as purchases from related parties while purchases from these companies prior to these acquisitions were reported as cost of revenues in addition we also had an increase in purchases from loop of 45 million in 2014 

consumer excise taxes increased   101 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 422 million  in 2014  compared 2013  primarily due to increases in taxable refined product sales volumes including the effects of the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets 

depreciation and amortization increased   320 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 106 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an impairment charge of 144 million related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery and the depreciation of the fair value of assets acquired along the east coast and southeast on september 30 2014 by our speedway segment the increase in 2014 was primarily due to completion of certain capital investments at our galveston bay refinery an increase in the number of convenience stores in our speedway segment and the implementation of corporatelevel information technology projects partially offset by an impairment of a light products terminal in 2013 

selling general and administrative expenses increased   201 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 127 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  the increase in 2015 was primarily due to increases in employee benefit costs contract services and additional expenses related to the convenience stores acquired along the east coast and southeast partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement expenses the increase in 2014  was primarily due to increases in contract services employee compensation and benefit expenses and credit card processing fees 

other taxes increased   1 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 50 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  other taxes in 2015 were comparable to 2014 the increase in the 2014 was primarily due to increases in property taxes of 30 million payroll taxes of 27 million and environmental taxes of 11 million partially offset by decreases in other tax expenses these increases were attributable to a number of factors including the acquisitions of the galveston bay refinery and related assets and hess’ retail operations and related assets and the absence of a federal oil spill tax refund received in 2013 

net interest and other financial costs increased   102 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 37 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  the increase in 2015 was primarily due to senior notes issued by mpc in september 2014 to finance the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets higher levels of borrowings on mplx’s bank revolving credit facility used to fund the acquisition of pipe line holdings and interest on the debt assumed from markwest the increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in longterm debt related to the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets and mplx’s acquisition of additional interest in pipe line holdings we capitalized interest of 37 million  in 2015  27 million  in 2014  and 28 million  in 2013  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 19  for further details 

provision for income taxes increased   226 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 167 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to our income before income taxes which increased   539 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 589 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  the effective tax rates in 2015  2014  and 2013  are slightly less than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences including the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12  for further details 

segment results 

revenues 

revenues are summarized by segment in the following table 



refining  marketing segment revenues decreased   2754 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 318 billion in 2014  compared to 2013  the decreases were primarily due to lower refined product sales prices partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes the table below shows our refining  marketing segment refined product sales volumes and prices 



 59 

the table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas 



refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment increased   111 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 162 billion in 2014  compared to 2013  the increases in intersegment refined product sales and sales volumes were primarily due to sales to the approximate 1245 convenience stores acquired in september 2014 along the east coast and southeast 



speedway segment revenues increased   276 billion  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 246 billion in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to increases  in gasoline and distillate sales of 143 billion  and 198 billion respectively and increases  in merchandise sales of 127 billion  and 476 million respectively the increases in gasoline and distillate sales were primarily due to volume increases of 21 billion gallons and 796 million gallons respectively primarily due to increases in the number of convenience stores as noted in the table below partially offset by decreases in gasoline and distillate selling prices of 089 per gallon and 020 per gallon respectively the increases in merchandise sales were primarily due to increases in the number of convenience stores and higher same store sales the increase in the number of convenience stores for 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of convenience stores along the east coast and southeast 

the following table includes certain revenue statistics for the speedway segment 



 midstream  segment revenue increased   154 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 60 million in 2014  compared to 2013  the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the financial results of markwest which are reflected in midstream segment income from the december 4 2015 merger date the increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in revenue related to volume deficiency credits and higher average tariffs received on crude oil and refined products shipped partially offset by lower refined products and crude oil pipeline throughput volumes 

the following table shows operating statistics for our midstream  segment 



 

income from operations 

income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table 



 refining  marketing segment income from operations increased   577 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 403 million in 2014  compared to 2013  the increase in refining  marketing segment income from operations in 2015  was  primarily due to higher crack spreads favorable effects of changes in market structure on crude oil acquisition prices more favorable net product price realizations compared to spot market reference prices and lower direct operating costs these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark lls crude oil the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains and an lcm inventory valuation charge of 345 million the increase in 2014 was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher usgc and chicago crack spreads partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs 

the following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business 



 based on the market indicators above and our refinery throughputs we estimate the following impacts on refining  marketing segment income from operations for 2015  compared to 2014  and for 2014  compared to 2013  

 61 

 the market indicators shown above use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold differences in our results compared to these market indicators including product price realizations mix and crude costs as well as the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances had an estimated negative impact on refining  marketing segment income of 103 billion in 2015  compared to 2014  and an estimated positive impact 135 billion in 2014  compared to 2013  we estimate the negative impact for 2015  was primarily due to unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to lls the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains the price differential of charge and blend stock relative to crude oil and the lcm inventory valuation charge partially offset by changes in market structure and refined product selling prices we estimate the positive impact for 2014  was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations as compared to spot market values and a lifo accounting benefit 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a lifo charge of 45 million as a result of decreased levels in refined products and crude inventory volumes since the lifo costs for these layers were based on 2014 costs the liquidation of these layers resulted in a charge to income in the fourth quarter of 2014  we recognized builds in our refined product and crude inventories these builds were based on 2014 costs which were significantly higher than fourth quarter 2014 costs and resulted in a benefit of approximately 240 million to income for the full year we recognized a lifo charge of 78 million in 2015 as compared to lifo benefits of 265 million in 2014 and 135 million in 2013 

the following table summarizes our refinery throughputs 



the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the refining  marketing segment 



 62 

refinery direct operating costs decreased   140  per barrel in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 137 per barrel in 2014  compared to 2013  which include a decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of 067  per barrel and an increase of 060 per barrel respectively and a decrease in other manufacturing costs of 071  per barrel and an increase of072 per barrel respectively the decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2015  was primarily attributable to the galveston bay robinson and garyville refineries partially offset by an increase at the detroit refinery the increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2014  was primarily attributable to the galveston bay robinson and catlettsburg refineries partially offset by decreases at the garyville and canton refineries the decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to lower energy costs and routine maintenance costs for 2015  the increase in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to higher energy costs catalyst expenses and routine maintenance costs for 2014 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 212 million in 2015  141 million in 2014  and 264 million in 2013  the increase in 2015 was primarily due to a 46 million charge in the second quarter to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance based on the renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015 proposed by the epa in may 2015 and finalized in november 2015 particularly those for biomass based diesel and advanced biofuels the remaining increase was primarily due to increased purchases of biomass based diesel rins at an increased average cost in 2015 as compared to 2014 partially offset by decreased purchases of ethanol rins at a decreased average cost in 2015 as compared to 2014 the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to decreases in the average cost of ethanol and biomassbased biodiesel rins and decreases in our estimated advanced biofuel and ethanol obligation volumes 

speedway segment income from operations increased   129 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 169 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of 401 million  and 246 million respectively and increases in our merchandise gross margin of 393 million  and 150 million respectively partially offset by higher operating expenses the increases were primarily attributable the full year effect of the locations acquired along the east coast and southeast on september 30 2014 the increases in merchandise gross margin were related to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recognized an lcm inventory valuation charge of 25 million 

the following table includes margin statistics for the speedway segment 



 midstream  segment income from operations increased   9 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 70 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the financial results of markwest which are reflected in midstream segment income from the december 4 2015 markwest merger date partially offset by 30 million of transaction costs the increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher pipeline transportation revenue and an increase in income from our pipeline affiliates which was primarily attributable to our investment in loop partially offset by an increase in operating expenses primarily attributable to the proposed cornerstone pipeline project and pipeline maintenance costs 

corporate and other unallocated expenses increased   22 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 15 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in 2015 was primarily due to a lower allocation of employee benefit costs to the segments the increase in 2014 was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets in 2014 

unallocated items also included an impairment charge of 144 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery the charge reflects the writeoff of all costs capitalized on the project through september 30 2015 including frontend engineering and long lead time equipment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for additional information on the impairment 

we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of 4 million  in 2015  96 million  in 2014  and 95 million  in 2013  resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during these years 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows

debttototalcapital ratio 

as described in further detail below the increase in debt as of yearend 2015 compared to yearend 2014 was primarily related to debt assumed by mplx as part of the markwest merger and increased mpc borrowings equity also increased primarily due to the issuance of mplx units with the markwest merger our debttototal capital ratio total debt to total debtplusequity was 38  percent and 37  percent at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively

after giving effect to the exchange offer and consent solicitation referred to above as of december 31 2015 markwest had outstanding approximately 40 million  aggregate principal amount of 5500 senior notes due february 15 2023 approximately 11 million  aggregate principal amount of 4500 senior notes due july 15 2023 approximately 1 million  aggregate principal amount of 4875 senior notes due december 1 2024 and approximately 11 million  aggregate principal amount of 4875 senior notes due june 1 2024 interest on each series of the markwest senior notes is payable semiannually in arrears on february 15 th  and august 15 th  of each year with respect to the 5500 2023 senior notes on january 15 th  and july 15 th  of each year with respect to the 4500 2023 senior notes and on june 1 st  and december 1 st  of each year with respect to the 4875 2024 senior notes and the 4875 2025 senior notes

the term loan agreement the mpc bank revolving credit facility and the mplx credit agreement contain representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types the financial covenant included in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization as defined in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility of no greater than 065 to 100 as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 033  to 100 as well as the other covenants contained in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility 

the mplx credit agreement includes certain representations and warranties affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type the mplx credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the mplx credit agreement for the prior four  fiscal quarters of no greater than 50  to 10 or 55  to 10 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period other covenants restrict mplx and certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt creating liens on its assets and entering into transactions with affiliates as of december 31 2015  mplx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement including a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 46  to 10 

our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile as of december 31 2015 the credit ratings on our and mplx’s senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

neither the revolving credit facility the mplx credit agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under the revolving credit facility and our trade receivables securitization facility in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could under certain circumstances decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements 

capital requirements 

our board approved a 2016 capital spending and investment plan of 42 billion towards the end of 2015 in light of current market conditions and revisions to expected completion dates for certain projects we expect 2016  capital spending and investments to be 30 billion  excluding capitalized interest additional details related to expected 2016  capital spending and investments are discussed in the capital budget outlook section below

we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market repurchases negotiated block transactions accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing and amount of future repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time

we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil these arrangements are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25  

capital budget outlook 

we expect to spend 30 billion  in 2016  on capital projects and investments excluding capitalized interest and any acquisitions we may make this represents a 23 percent   increase  from our 2015  spending due to additional midstream capital spending resulting from the markwest merger the budget includes spending on refining retail marketing and midstream projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

refining  marketing 

the refining  marketing segment’s forecasted 2016  capital spending and investments is 13 billion  which includes approximately 250 million  for midstream related assets approximately 375 million  for refining margin enhancement projects and approximately 675 million  for refinerysustaining capital a number of these projects span multiple years

midstream   

the midstream   segment’s forecasted 2016  capital spend of 13 billion  including 11 billion  for mplx which represents the midpoint of the growth capital spending forecast of 800 million  to 12 billion  plus approximately 60 million  for maintenance capital spending mplx is focused on projects attributed to markwest’s ongoing development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure to support its producer customers particularly those in the marcellus and utica shale regions markwest is a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx

our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forwardlooking statements are based on currently available information if this information proves to be inaccurate future availability of financing may be adversely affected factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided by operating activities the state of worldwide debt and equity markets investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance the global financial climate and in particular with respect to borrowings the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies the discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forwardlooking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending costs for projects under construction project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth upgrades and expansion the forwardlooking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance actual results may differ materially from these expectations estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products actions of competitors delays in obtaining necessary thirdparty approvals changes in labor materials and equipment costs and availability planned and unplanned outages the delay of cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects project cost overruns disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response and other operating and economic considerations these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements for additional information on forwardlooking statements and risks that can affect our business see “disclosures regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

transactions with related parties 

we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7  for discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers for additional information see item 1a risk factors 

our environmental expenditures including nonregulatory expenditures for each of the last three years were 



 we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation or regulations it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for nine  percent five  percent and four  percent of capital expenditures excluding the markwest merger and the acquisitions of the galveston bay refinery and related assets and hess’ retail operations and related assets in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 356 million  or twelve  percent of total capital expenditures in 2016  predictions beyond 2016  can only be broadbased estimates which have varied and will continue to vary due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies among other matters based on currently identified projects we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately 539 million  in 2017  however actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

 74 

valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 

 impairment assessments of longlived assets intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions significant assumptions include 

 we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a poor outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes a significant reduction in natural gas or ngls processed significant reduction in refining margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets site level for speedway segment convenience stores the plant level or pipeline system level and the customer relationship for our customer contract intangibles for midstream  segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value 

unlike longlived assets goodwill and intangibles must be tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at december 31 2015  we had a total of 40 billion  of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value for each of our reporting units in 2015  

the carrying values of certain reporting units in our midstream segment equaled their fair values as of the date of the markwest merger any decrease in the fair value of these reporting units going forward could result in an impairment charge to the approximate 25 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger 

in february of 2016 mplx common units were trading at a price per unit which is significantly lower than the price per unit used to calculate the merger consideration and the resulting goodwill that was assigned to certain reporting units in our midstream segment 

the significant assumptions which were used to develop the estimates of the fair values recorded in acquisition accounting and the resulting goodwill assigned to the reporting units included discount rates growth rates and customer attrition rates if mplx experiences negative events related to these assumptions or if the market price of mplx common units continues to trade at a low level in 2016 mplx may need to assess whether this is a change in circumstances that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units to which they assigned goodwill in connection with the markwest merger is less than their carrying value and if so evaluate goodwill for impairment 

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value at december 31 2015  we had 362 billion  of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2015 at december 31 2015  centennial was not shipping product as a result we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in centennial we concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of centennial’s assets if market conditions were to change and the owners of centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets there could be a future impairment of our centennial interest as of december 31 2015  our equity investment in centennial was 37 million  and we had a 34 million  guarantee associated with 50 percent of centennial’s outstanding debt see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25  for additional information on the debt guarantee 

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to the carrying value of our centennial equity investment factors that could affect the carrying value of our centennial equity investment include but are not limited to a change in business conditions a further decline or improvement in the longterm outlook of the potential uses of centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

acquisitions 

in accounting for business combinations acquired assets and liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired if any is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain respectively a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property plant and equipment intangible assets contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and for certain acquisitions engage thirdparty consultants for assistance 

the fair value of assets and liabilities including contingent consideration as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches including the income approach which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate the cost approach which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entityspecific differences the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 

for the customer contract intangibles for our midstream  segment we must estimate the expected life of the relationships with our customers on an individual basis the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 

the fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to bp is remeasured each quarter using an income approach with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues the amount of cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a marketbased crack spread and refinery throughput volumes for the months during which the contract applies as well as established thresholds that cap the annual and total payment we used internal and external forecasts for the crack spread and internal forecasts for refinery throughput volumes and applied an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate to the range of cash flows indicated by various scenarios to determine the fair value of the arrangement see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5  for additional information on our acquisitions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  for additional information on fair value measurements 

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 17  additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

variable interest entities 

we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests variable interests can be contractual ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie’s assets when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated 

significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie we evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest andor if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group we continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions 

markwest utica emg a natural gas and ngl processing joint venture is a vie however we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary as a result it is accounted for under the equity method changes in the design or nature of the activities of this entity or our involvement with the entity may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity’s status as a vie andor our status as the primary beneficiary such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization this could result in the consolidation of the entity which would have a significant impact on our financial statements ohio gathering is a subsidiary of markwest utica emg and is a vie if we were to consolidate markwest utica emg ohio gathering would need to be assessed for consolidation or deconsolidation 

variable interest entities are discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6   

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 

 77 

we utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuary’s discount rate model this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 365 percent for our pension plans and 415 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 42 million and 32 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 2 million and 4 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 51 percent equity securities and 49 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness after evaluating activity in the capital markets along with the current and projected plan investments we reduced the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 700 percent to 675 percent effective for 2015 we used the 700 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2014 defined benefit pension expense decreasing the 675 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 4 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

we utilized the 2015 mortality tables from the us society of actuaries 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 22  includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

contingent liabilities 

we accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions claims litigation environmental remediation tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and thirdparty indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable we regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons for instance settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes which are recorded as other taxes for additional information on contingent liabilities see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – environmental matters and compliance costs 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

as discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3  to our audited consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2015  we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 17  and 18  for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

refining  marketing 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also authorize the use of the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below lifo inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

midstream 

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand as well as market uncertainty availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond mplx’s control mplx’s profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at its own or third‑party processing plants purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by mplx’s producer customers such prices also affect profitability to protect mplx financially against adverse price movements and to maintain more stable and predictable cash flows so that it can meet its cash distribution objectives debt service and capital plans mplx executes a strategy governed by its risk management policy mplx has a committee comprised of senior management that oversees risk management activities continually monitors the risk management program and adjusts its strategy as conditions warrant derivative contracts utilized for crude oil natural gas and ngls are swaps and options traded on the otc market and fixed price forward contracts as a result of mplx’s current derivative positions it believes that it has mitigated a portion of its expected commodity price risk through the fourth quarter of 2016 mplx would be exposed to additional commodity risk in certain situations such as if producers under‑deliver or over‑deliver products or if processing facilities are operated in different recovery modes in the event that mplx has derivative positions in excess of the product delivered or expected to be delivered the excess derivative positions may be terminated 

mplx management conducts a standard credit review on counterparties to derivative contracts and it has provided the counterparties with a guaranty as credit support for its obligations a separate agreement with certain counterparties allows markwest liberty midstream to enter into derivative positions without posting cash collateral mplx uses standardized agreements that allow for offset of certain positive and negative exposures in the event of default or other terminating events including bankruptcy 

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the table below sets forth information relating to our significant open commodity derivative contracts as of december 31 2015  

  



a   100 percent  of exchangetraded contracts expire in the first quarter of 2016 

b   100  percent of exchangetraded contracts expire in the first quarter of 2016 

c  chicago mercantile exchange “cme” 

d  intercontinental exchange “ice” 

e  reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending “rbob” 

sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2015  is provided in the following table 



we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2015  would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations related to our debt obligations at december 31 2015  our debt was primarily comprised of the 225 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued february 1 2011 the 195 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued september 5 2014 the 500 million  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mplx senior notes issued february 12 2015 the 150 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued december 15 2015 and the 404 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mplx senior notes issued december 22 2015 additionally we have 183 billion  of variable rate term debt 

sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint change in interest rates on longterm debt as of december 31 2015  is provided in the following table fair value of cash and cash equivalents receivables accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the shortterm maturity of the instruments accordingly these instruments are excluded from the table 

  



 at december 31 2015  our portfolio of longterm debt was comprised of fixedrate instruments and variablerate borrowings under the term loan agreement the mplx term loan facility and mplx bank revolving credit facility the fair value of our fixedrate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixedrate debt at prices above carrying value interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the term loan agreement the mplx term loan facility and mplx bank revolving credit facility but may affect our results of operations and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2015  

counterparty risk 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment by our customers to whom we provide services or sell natural gas or ngls we believe that certain contracts would allow us to pass those losses through to our customers thus reducing our risk when we are selling ngls and acting as our producer customers’ agent our credit exposure related to these customers is represented by the value of our trade receivables where exposed to credit risk we analyze the customer’s financial condition prior to entering into a transaction or agreement establish credit terms and monitor the appropriateness of these terms on an ongoing basis in the event of a customer default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by counterparties or future commission merchants our credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date these outstanding instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements should the creditworthiness of one or more of our counterparties decline our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party in the event of a counterparty default we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted this counterparty credit risk does not apply to our embedded derivative as the overall value is a liability we regularly review the creditworthiness of counterparties and futures commission merchants and enter into master netting agreements when appropriate 

forwardlooking statements 

these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forwardlooking statements with respect to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil other refinery feedstocks refined products and ethanol if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements

 item 1 business 

overview 

marathon petroleum corporation “mpc” was incorporated in delaware on november 9 2009 we have 127  years of experience in the energy business with roots tracing back to the formation of the ohio oil company in 1887 we are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining marketing retail and transportation businesses in the united states and the largest east of the mississippi our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing speedway and pipeline transportation each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11  for operating segment and geographic financial information which is incorporated herein by reference 

corporate history and structure 

mpc was incorporated in 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of marathon oil corporation “marathon oil” on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its refining marketing  transportation business “rmt business” into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil common stock on june 30 2011 the “spinoff” following the spinoff marathon oil retained no ownership interest in mpc and each company had separate public ownership boards of directors and management all subsidiaries and equity method investments not contributed by marathon oil to mpc remained with marathon oil and together with marathon oil are referred to as the “marathon oil companies” on july 1 2011 our common stock began trading “regularway” on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the ticker symbol “mpc”

our competitive strengths 

high quality refining assets 

we believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the midwest and the fourth largest in the united states based on crude oil refining capacity we own a seven plant refinery network with approximately 17  million barrels per calendar day “mmbpcd” of crude oil throughput capacity our refineries process a wide range of crude oils including heavy and sour crude oils which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates specialty chemicals and other refined products while we have historically processed significant quantities of heavy and sour crude oils our refineries have the ability to process up to 68 percent light sweet crude oils 

strategic location 

the geographic locations of our refineries provide us with strategic advantages located in petroleum administration for defense district “padd” ii and padd iii which consist of states in the midwest and the gulf coast regions of the united states our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources including domestic canadian and other foreign sources which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs for example geographic proximity to various united states shale oil regions and canadian crude oil supply sources allows our refineries access to priceadvantaged crude oils and lower transportation costs than certain of our competitors our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access refined product export markets and to serve a broad range of key enduser markets across the united states quickly and costeffectively 

    

 extensive midstream distribution networks 

our assets give us extensive flexibility and optionality to respond promptly to dynamic market conditions including weatherrelated and marketplace disruptions we believe the relative scale of our transportation and distribution assets and operations distinguishes us from other refining and marketing companies we currently own lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8300  miles of crude oil and products pipelines through our ownership interests in mplx we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the united states on the basis of total volume delivered we also own one of the largest   private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the united states as well as trucking and rail assets we operate this system in coordination with our refining and marketing network which enables us to optimize feedstock and other raw material supplies and refined product distribution and further allows for important economies of scale across our system 

general partner and sponsor of mplx 

our investment in mplx should allow us to enhance our share price through our limited partner and general partner interests which tend to receive higher market multiples mplx also provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets mplx’s significant liquidity and access to the capital markets should provide us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream logistics business our role as the general partner allows us to maintain strategic control of the assets so we can continue to optimize our refinery feedstock and distribution networks we have an extensive portfolio of midstream assets that can potentially be sold andor contributed to mplx providing mplx with a competitive advantage as of december 31 2014  these assets included 

 we continue to focus resources on growing this portfolio of midstream assets including investments in the sandpiper and sax pipeline projects and a condensate splitter project at our catlettsburg refinery we broadly estimate these assets and growth projects can generate annual earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization “ebitda” of 16 billion see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on these pipeline investments 

competitively positioned marketing operations 

we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area we have two strong retail brands speedway ®  and marathon ®  we believe that speedway llc a whollyowned subsidiary operates the second largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states with approximately 2750  convenience stores in 22  states throughout the midwest east coast and southeast the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states comprised of approximately 5460  retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19  states as of december 31 2014  in addition as part of the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets in 2013 and hess’ retail operations and related assets in 2014 we obtained retail marketing contracts that provide us with the opportunity to convert the associated retail outlets to the marathon brand as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding retail marketing contract assignments for approximately 590  retail outlets we believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost 

attractive growth opportunities 

we believe we have attractive growth opportunities our capital and investment budget for 2015 of 253 billion  includes 128 billion  for the refining  marketing segment which includes 234 million  for midstream investments 452 million  for the speedway segment and 659 million  for the pipeline transportation segment 

our refining  marketing segment’s midstream investments include building condensate splitters at our canton ohio and catlettsburg kentucky refineries to increase our capacity to process condensate from the utica shale region the condensate splitter at our canton refinery began operation at the end of 2014 and we expect to complete the condensate splitter at our catlettsburg refinery in 2015 our refining  marketing segment’s investments also include refining margin enhancement projects including projects to further capture synergies at our galveston bay refinery increase our distillate production expand our export capacity and increase our capacity to process condensates and light crude oils 

our speedway segment investments include converting and integrating hess’ retail operations and related assets constructing new convenience stores and rebuilding existing locations we also anticipate acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions 

our pipeline transportation segment’s midstream investments include investments in equity interests in the sandpiper and sax pipeline projects that will transport crude oil from growing north american hydrocarbon production regions to our refineries mplx is also pursuing the cornerstone pipeline project which will connect the utica shale production to our canton ohio refinery there are also potential opportunities for additional buildout projects to provide transportation solutions from the utica shale region to a wide range of markets 

established track record of profitability and diversified income stream 

we have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the refining cycle we believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results income generated by our speedway segment which was significantly expanded with the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets and our pipeline transportation segment is less sensitive to business cycles while our refining  marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable 

strong financial position 

as of december 31 2014  we had 149 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and 380 billion  in unused committed borrowing facilities excluding mplx’s credit facility we had 664 billion  of debt at yearend which represented 37  percent of our total capitalization this combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage provides financial flexibility to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies 

our business strategies 

achieve and maintain toptier safety and environmental performance 

we remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations we have a history of safe and reliable operations which was demonstrated again in 2014 with a solid performance compared to the industry average four of our refineries have earned designation as a us occupational safety and health administration “osha” voluntary protection program “vpp” star site in addition we remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency and reliability of our operations we proactively address our regulatory requirements and encourage our operations to improve their environmental performance with our 2014 designated environmental incidents showing an additional 15 percent reduction over 2013 results our robinson illinois refinery had no significant designated environmental incidents in 2014 and our galveston bay refinery achieved further reduction of approximately 87 percent in designated environmental incidents since we acquired it on february 1 2013 

grow highervalued stable cash flow businesses 

we intend to allocate significantly more capital to grow our midstream and retail businesses these businesses typically have more predictable and stable income and cash flows compared to our refining operations and we believe investors assign a higher value to businesses with stable cash flows our capital and investment budget for 2015 includes investments in both our refining  marketing and pipeline transportation segments related to midstream assets we have budgeted 234 million  for midstream assets that are part of the refining  marketing segment 659 million  for the pipeline transportation segment and 452 million  for the speedway segment 

we plan to substantially accelerate the growth of mplx and intend to evolve it into a large cap diversified mlp we intend to increase revenue on the mplx network of pipeline systems through higher utilization of existing assets by capitalizing on organic investment opportunities that may arise from the growth of mpc’s operations and from increased thirdparty activity in mplx’s areas of operations we also plan to pursue acquisitions of midstream assets through mplx both within our existing geographic footprint and in new areas we expect there will continue to be significant investments in infrastructure to connect growing north american crude oil production with existing refining assets and to move refined products to wholesale and retail marketing customers we intend to aggressively participate in this infrastructure buildout and grow our midstream business primarily through mplx 

we significantly expanded speedway’s presence along the east coast and southeast through our acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets we intend to continue growing speedway’s sales and profitability by focusing on the conversion and integration of these locations from which we expect to realize increased merchandise sales and other synergies we also remain focused on organic growth through constructing new stores rebuilding old stores acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions and improving margins at our existing operations we have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market western pennsylvania and tennessee in addition our highly successful speedy rewards ®  customer loyalty program which has more than 39 million  active members as of december 31 2014  provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our speedway customer base with existing and new speedway locations including the stores recently acquired from hess 

deliver top quartile refining performance 

our refineries are well positioned to benefit from the growing crude oil and condensate production in north america including the bakken eagle ford and utica shale regions along with the canadian oil sands we are also well positioned to export distillates gasoline and other products 

we intend to enhance our margins in the refining  marketing segment by capturing synergies at our galveston bay refinery increasing our condensate and light crude oil processing capacity growing our distillate production and expanding our exports for example we recently completed construction of a condensate splitter at our canton refinery and we have a project underway to increase condensate processing capacity at our catlettsburg refinery we also have projects to increase light crude oil processing capacity at our robinson refinery to increase distillate production at our garyville louisiana galveston bay and robinson refineries and to expand the export capacity at our garyville and galveston bay refineries we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our existing asset base with an emphasis on increasing distillate production light crude oil processing and export capabilities and synergistic opportunities at our galveston bay refinery 

sustain focus on shareholder returns 

we intend to continue our focus on the return of capital to shareholders in the form of a strong and growing base dividend supplemented by share repurchases we have increased our quarterly dividend by 150  percent since becoming a standalone company in june 2011 and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling 80 billion  through open market purchases and two accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs we repurchased 89 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 627 billion  representing approximately 25  percent of our outstanding common shares when we became a standalone company in june 2011 after the effects of these repurchases 173 billion  of the 80 billion  total authorization was available for future repurchases as of december 31 2014  

increase assured sales volumes at our marathon brand and speedway locations 

we consider assured sales as those sales we make to marathon brand customers our speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts we believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations between our refineries our pipelines and our terminals the marathon brand has been a consistent vehicle for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets significantly expands our speedway presence from nine  to 22  states throughout the east coast and southeast and enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations providing an outlet for an incremental 200  mbpd of assured sales from our refining system 

utilize and enhance our high quality employee workforce 

we utilize our high quality employee workforce by continuing to leverage our commercial skills in addition we continue to enhance our workforce through selective hiring practices and effective training programs on safety environmental stewardship and other professional and technical skills

our speedway segment sells gasoline diesel and merchandise through convenience stores that it owns and operates primarily under the speedway and hess brands we have the right to use the hess brand through september 30 2017 we are in the process of converting convenience stores acquired from hess to the speedway brand which we target to complete by the end of 2016 speedway convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items speedway’s speedy rewards® loyalty program has been a highly successful loyalty program since its inception in 2004 with a consistently growing base of more than 39 million  active members as of december 31 2014  due to speedway’s ability to capture and analyze memberspecific transactional data speedway is able to offer the speedy rewards® members discounts and promotions specific to their buying behavior we believe speedy rewards® is a key reason customers choose speedway over competitors and it continues to drive significant value for both speedway and our speedy rewards® members 

the demand for gasoline is seasonal with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel merchandise margin as a percent of total gross margin for speedway decreased in 2014 primarily related to the convenience stores acquired from hess the following table sets forth speedway merchandise statistics for the past three years 



as of december 31 2014  speedway had 2746  convenience stores in 22  states the following table sets forth the number of convenience stores by state owned by our speedway segment as of december 31 2014  



pipeline transportation 

as of december 31 2014  we owned leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8300  miles of crude oil and products pipelines of which approximately 2900  miles are owned through our investments in mplx 

mplx 

in 2012 we formed mplx a master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on october 31 2012 mplx completed its initial public offering as of december 31 2014  we owned a 715 percent  interest in mplx including the two percent  general partner interest and mplx’s assets consisted of a 995 percent general partner interest in pipe line holdings which owns common carrier pipeline systems through marathon pipe line llc “mpl” and ohio river pipe line llc “orpl” and a 100 percent  interest in a one million  barrel butane storage cavern in west virginia 

as of december 31 2014  pipe line holdings through mpl and orpl owned or leased and operated 1004  miles of common carrier crude oil lines and 1902  miles of common carrier products lines located in nine  states and four  tank farms in illinois and indiana with available storage capacity of 329 million  barrels that is committed to mpc the table below sets forth additional detail regarding these pipeline systems and storage assets as of december 31 2014  



 the pipe line holdings common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the united states based on total volume delivered third parties generated 12  percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on these common carrier pipelines in 2014  excluding volumes shipped by mpc under joint tariffs with third parties these common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years 



 18 

mpcretained assets and investments 

we retained ownership interests in several crude oil and products pipeline systems and pipeline companies mpc consolidated volumes transported through our common carrier pipelines which include mplx and our undivided joint interests are shown in the following table for each of the last three years 



as of december 31 2014  we owned undivided joint interests in the following common carrier crude oil pipeline systems 



as of december 31 2014  we had partial ownership interests in the following pipeline companies 



 19 

we also own 183  miles of private crude oil pipelines and 760  miles of private refined products pipelines that are operated by mpl for the benefit of our refining  marketing segment on a cost recovery basis the following table provides additional information on these assets 



 as of december 31 2014  we owned or leased 60  private tanks with storage capacity of approximately 65 million  barrels which are located along mpl and orpl pipelines 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products based upon the “the oil  gas journal 2014  worldwide refinery survey” we ranked fourth among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity as of december 31 2014  we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale spot branded and retail distribution we believe we compete with about 60  companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers about 90  companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market 12  refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded independent entrepreneurs and approximately 910  retailers in the retail sale of refined products in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and retail consumers we do not produce any of the crude oil we refine 

we also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their independent entrepreneurs and other wellrecognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers often selling gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise at competitive prices nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into sales of retail gasoline and diesel fuel energy analysts international inc estimated such retailers had approximately 14  percent of the us gasoline market in mid 2014  

our pipeline transportation operations are highly regulated which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils west texas intermediate “wti” and light louisiana sweet “lls” crude oils and other market structure differentials also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

environmental matters 

our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for reviewing our overall environmental performance we also have a corporate emergency response team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review discussion or implementation the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant for additional information see item 1a risk factors we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products additionally we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable 

our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment such laws and regulations include among others the clean air act “caa” with respect to air emissions the clean water act “cwa” with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized 

for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air water solid waste and remediation see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters and compliance costs 

air 

we are subject to many requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations the us environmental protection agency “epa” issued an “endangerment finding” in 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to this endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emissions standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles the endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the caa and the epa’s socalled “tailoring rule” led to permitting of larger stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions including refineries legal challenges filed against these epa actions were overruled by the dc circuit court of appeals in june 2014 the supreme court limited the epa’s greenhouse gas permitting authority to only those sources that also trigger prevention of significant deterioration “psd” conventional pollutants a few mpc projects triggered greenhouse gas permitting requirements but any additional capital spend will likely not be significant legal challenges continue in the wake of the supreme court decision the epa has proposed new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions for new and existing electric utility generating units this could impact electric and natural gas rates for all our operations and could impose new requirements on the combined heat and power unit we operate congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax private parties have sued utilities and other emitters of greenhouse gas emissions but such suits have been largely unsuccessful we have not been named in any of those lawsuits privateparty litigation is also pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken in sum requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments these requirements may also significantly affect mpc’s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the extent and magnitude of the impact from greenhouse gas regulation or legislation cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 

in 2013 the obama administration developed the social cost of carbon “scc” the scc is to be used by the epa and other federal agencies in regulatory costbenefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases the scc was first issued in 2010 in 2013 the obama administration significantly increased the estimate to 36 per ton in response to the regulated community and congress’ critiques of how the scc was developed the office of management and budget provided an opportunity to comment on the scc but ultimately did not make any significant revisions in december 2014 the white house council on environmental quality “ceq” issued new draft guidance for assessing greenhouse gas emissions under the national environmental policy act “nepa” adding for the first time language that requires the analyses to also include the impact of climate change on projects including using the scc when analyzing costs and benefits of a project while the impact of a higher scc in future regulations is not known at this time it may result in increased costs to our operations 

the epa has reviewed and has revised or will propose to revise the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for criteria air pollutants the naaqs are subject to multiple court challenges making compliance planning uncertain the epa promulgated a revised ozone standard in march 2008 and commenced a multiyear process to develop the implementing rules required by the caa on december 17 2014 the epa proposed to revise the naaqs for ozone if the ozone standard is revised it is expected to be effective in december 2015 after which states will begin developing implementation plans that will take several years to receive final epa approval the impact of a stricter standard cannot be accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding the final standard and the additional requirements that states may impose also in 2010 the epa adopted new shortterm standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide and in december 2012 issued a more stringent fine particulate matter standard “pm 25” in december 2014 the epa finalized the nonattainment areas for pm 25 none of our refineries are located in the nonattainment areas for pm 25 however our cincinnati renewable fuels llc facility is located in cincinnati oh which was designated as a nonattainment area we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these proposed and revised naaqs standards until the standards are finalized individual state implementing rules are established and judicial challenges are resolved 

the epa finalized the boiler and process heater maximum achievable control technology “boiler mact” in march 2011 with work practice standards that are applicable to refinery and natural gas fired equipment subsequently in january 2013 the epa made certain revisions to the march 2011 final rule in response to petitions for reconsideration in december 2014 the epa proposed reconsideration of limited issues and proposed to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunctions currently litigation is pending in the dc circuit court on both the 2011 and 2013 rulemakings we anticipate litigation to continue through 2015 we are in the process of implementing the work practice standards final financial impacts of the boiler mact rule cannot be determined at this time because the ongoing litigation could affect the final rule 

on june 30 2014 the epa proposed to revise existing refinery air emissions standards the final rule is expected to be issued by june 17 2015 and allows for implementation through june 2018 epa’s periodic review and possible revision of these standards is required under the caa this rule may require additional controls lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring due to the present uncertainty regarding final standards we cannot reasonably estimate the cost associated with this rule 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other things requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances also in case of any such release opa90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages opa90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements 

additionally opa90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be doublehulled and that existing tank vessels that are not doublehulled be retrofitted or removed from us service all barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the doublehulled requirements of opa90 we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

in 2013 the epa and the us army corps of engineers proposed significant changes to the definition of the term “waters of the us” wotus used in numerous programs under the cwa the proposed changes have the potential to expand permitting planning and reporting obligations and extend the timing to secure permits for pipeline and fixed asset construction and maintenance activities some manmade water bodies on our plant sites firewater ponds stormwater systems and green infrastructure systems may become wotus which may require new permits requiring the control of liquids entering and exiting these water bodies a final rule is anticipated in early 2015 

in may 2014 the epa issued the final rule regarding cooling water intake structures which impacts three of our refineries the final rule established closedloop cooling as one of eight required technologies the final rule also requires company engagement with fish and wildlife to determine if any endangered species are at risk in the locations during the next npdes permit cycle this rule will apply with the next npdes renewal at our catlettsburg garyville and robinson refineries this rule is not anticipated to have a material impact on our operations 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks “usts” containing regulated substances we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at two of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite thirdparty treatment and disposal facilities ongoing rcrarelated costs however are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain convenience stores and other locations where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the applicable state laws and regulations a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

mileage standards renewable fuels and other fuels requirements 

in 2007 the us congress passed the energy independence and security act “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 and contains a second renewable fuel standard “rfs2” in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking new or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations 

the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 1655 billion gallons in 2013 and increases to 360 billion gallons by 2022 epa has not finalized the 2014 volumes at this time in the near term the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline vehicle regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline “e10” but blending more than e10 could be required if the rfs2 standards are not modified the rfs2 has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use within the overall 360 billion gallon rfs2 eisa established an advanced biofuel rfs2 volume of 20 billion gallons in 2012 increasing to 210 billion gallons in 2022 subsets within the advanced biofuel rfs2 include biomassbased diesel which was set at 10 billion gallons in 2012 128 billion gallons in 2013 and at least 10 billion gallons in 2014 through 2022 to be determined by the epa through future rulemaking and cellulosic biofuel which was set at 05 billion gallons in 2012 and 10 billion gallons in 2013 increasing to 160 billion gallons by 2022 in 2013 the epa used its waiver authority under the caa to reduce the amount of cellulosic biofuel required under the statute from 10 billion gallons to 60 million gallons currently litigation is ongoing in the dc circuit court of appeals with respect to the epa’s determination of the 2013 cellulosic biofuel requirement subsequently industry has requested the epa to use its waiver authority for 2014 requesting reductions for total renewable fuel advanced biofuels and cellulosic biofuels volumetric obligations 

on november 29 2013 the epa issued a proposed rule for the 2014 renewal fuel volume requirements on november 21 2014 the epa announced the rule would not become final until sometime in 2015 this continues the lack of clarity and timeliness that has become common place with the epa’s administration of the rfs2 requirements this proposed rule has substantially reduced the rfs2 requirements from the statutory numbers as follows total renewables has been reduced from 1815 to 1521 billion gallons the advanced requirement has been reduced from 375 to 220 billion gallons the biomassbased diesel requirement has remained flat from 2013 at 128 billion gallons and the cellulosic requirement has been reduced from 175 billion to 17 million gallons if these proposed requirements become final it will allow the obligated parties to comply in 2014 without needing any substantial volumes of 85 percent ethanolblended or 15 percent ethanolblended “e15” gasolines and postpone the issues and concerns of having to blend ethanol past the e10 “blendwall” at least for 2014 likewise the epa has not finalized the 2015 renewable fuel volumes as required by the november 30 2014 statutory deadline as a result the future of the rfs still remains undecided and is in need of a legislative rewrite or repeal to provide a stable business platform for the obligated parties 

with potentially uncertain supplies the advanced biofuels programs may present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels including biomassbased diesel and cellulosic biofuel additionally the epa did not finalize the 2013 rfs2 renewable fuel obligations until august 2013 therefore it is uncertain how industry will comply with meeting the advanced biofuels obligation the continued delay of the final rule for 2014 has also delayed the day when compliance reports are due for 2013 in 2012 and 2013 the epa also discovered that 173 million biodiesel renewable identification numbers “rins” used to meet the annual requirement for that fuel had been fraudulently created and sold to unsuspecting third parties including mpc the epa finalized a rule establishing a quality assurance program for rins purchased to help meet the annual biofuel requirements under the rfs2 program the program is aimed at reducing the risks that rins are fraudulently created or sold we have already instituted internal procedures to help mitigate that risk 

we made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel rfs2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product and by buying needed biodiesel rins in the epacreated biodiesel rins market on april 1 2014 we purchased a facility in cincinnati ohio which currently produces biodiesel glycerin and other byproducts the capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million  gallons per year as a producer of biodiesel we now generate rins thereby reducing our reliance on the external rin market 

on october 13 2010 the epa issued a partial waiver decision under the caa to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from e10 to e15 for 2007 and newer lightduty motor vehicles on january 21 2011 the epa issued a second waiver for the use of e15 in vehicles model year 20012006 there are numerous issues including state and federal regulatory issues which need to be addressed before e15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines 

there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in eisa and related regulations we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 

on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million “ppm” beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm we anticipate that we will spend an estimated 750 million to 1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate while others relate to the ownership of our common stock 

our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business 

a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products the measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil or crack spread is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins historically refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions any overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins many of the factors influencing a change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control these factors include 

 some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce which may reduce our revenues income from operations and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures impair the carrying value of our assets such as property plant and equipment inventory or goodwill decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages severe weather labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as acts of terrorism for example pipelines provide a nearlyexclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries in such instances a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including but not limited to explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

we rely on the performance of our information technology systems the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and network infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems involve data network and telecommunications internet access and website functionality and various computer hardware equipment and software applications including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business these systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters software viruses or other malware power failures cyberattacks and other events we also face various other cybersecurity threats including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans there can be no guarantee such plans to the extent they are in place will be effective 

the retail market is diverse and highly competitive and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business 

we face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices several nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business these nontraditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow because of their diversity integration of operations experienced management and greater financial resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market in addition these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts adversely affecting our profit margins additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the development availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred 

we have significant debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

at december 31 2014  our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were 67 billion  we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

 a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money andor limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to 13 billion depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables in periods of lower prices we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 38 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our texas city and detroit refineries are scheduled to expire in march 2015 and january 2019 respectively the contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our canton catlettsburg and galveston bay refineries expired on january 31 2015 and no successor agreements have been negotiated in addition three agreements scheduled to expire on september 14 2015 march 14 2016 and june 30 2016 respectively cover certain speedway llc hourly employees at certain outlets in new york and new jersey these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us in addition we have experienced or may experience work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership mplx which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain levels we could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920 which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens among other requirements to establish citizenship corporations that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by us citizens if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although the spinoff occurred in mid 2011 certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil however if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries whether accruing before on or after the spinoff we also agreed to be responsible for and indemnify marathon oil with respect to all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff or certain internal restructuring transactions failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368a and 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation warranty covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement in addition we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified taxrelated liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities at this time we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts the tax liabilities described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

the spinoff could be determined not to qualify as a taxfree transaction and marathon oil and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify marathon oil for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

marathon oil received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spinoff qualifies as taxfree to marathon oil us and marathon oil stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a and related provisions of the code if the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect then marathon oil would not be able to continue to rely on the ruling we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations that were relied on in the private letter ruling to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect if notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling the spinoff were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code marathon oil would be subject to tax as if it had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares 

with respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed on marathon oil in connection with the spinoff and certain related transactions as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences as set forth in the private letter ruling we would be liable to marathon oil under the tax sharing agreement for any such taxes or liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us any of our affiliates or any person that after the spinoff is our affiliate we may be similarly liable if we breach specified representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement if we are required to indemnify marathon oil for taxes incurred as a result of the spinoff or certain related transactions being taxable to marathon oil it would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have potential liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil in connection with the spinoff that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions that were required to affect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves if marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant acquisitions involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows  

significant transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses present potential risks which may include among others 

 

risks relating to our industry 

changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following 

 the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we believe the issue of climate change will likely continue to receive scientific and political attention with the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations the us pledge in 2009 as part of the copenhagen accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect and was reaffirmed in the president’s 2013 climate action plan meetings of the united nations climate change conference however have produced no legally binding emission reduction requirements on the us also in 2009 the epa issued an “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to the endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles the endangerment finding the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act resulted in permitting of greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources but as a result of the epa’s “tailoring rule” permit applicability was limited to larger sources such as refineries legal challenges were filed against these epa actions in june 2014 the us supreme court ruled that the clean air act prevention of significant deterioration program for new and modified stationary sources is not triggered by greenhouse gas emissions alone the us supreme court did however uphold the requirement for new or modified stationary sources that will also emit a criteria pollutant to control greenhouse gas emissions through best available control technology implementing best available control technology may result in increased costs to our operations 

in 2013 the obama administration developed the social cost of carbon “scc” the scc is to be used by the epa and other federal agencies in regulatory costbenefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases the scc was first issued in 2010 in 2013 the obama administration significantly increased the estimate to 36 per ton in response to the regulated community and congress’ critiques of how the scc was developed the office of management and budget provided an opportunity to comment on the scc but ultimately did not make any significant revisions in december 2014 the white house council on environmental quality “ceq” issued new draft guidance for assessing greenhouse gas emissions under the national environmental policy act “nepa” adding for the first time language that requires that analyses also include the impact of climate change on projects including using the scc when analyzing costs and benefits of a project while the impact of a higher scc in future regulations is not known at this time it may result in increased costs to our operations 

in 2013 the epa proposed carbon emission standards for new power plants built in the future in june 2014 the epa proposed the clean power plan which would reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants through the plan the epa proposes to reduce nationwide carbon emissions from the power generation sector by 30 percent below 2005 levels these standards if finalized could increase our electricity costs and potentially reduce the reliability of our electricity supply 

in the future congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax other measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review or implementation in the us these measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions private party litigation is pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken these actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented although uncertain these developments could increase our costs reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 

in november 2014 the epa proposed a tightening of the primary health ozone national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” to within the range of 65 to 70 parts per billion “ppb” while accepting comments on levels as low as 60 ppb and an option of maintaining the current ozone level of 75 ppb in addition the epa is asking for comment on a new secondary welfare ozone naaqs using a threemonth seasonal index the final rule is expected to be promulgated in late 2015 if timely finalized the epa would then implement a revised ozone naaqs with attainment and nonattainment designations by late 2017 using 20142016 air quality monitor data a lower primary ozone standard may not by attainable in many areas and could result in the cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities 

the eisa among other things sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the us by model year 2020 and contains a second renewable fuel standard commonly referred to as rfs2 in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking increases in fuel mileage standards and the increased use of renewable fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels may reduce demand for refined products governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could also pose a competitive threat to our operations 

the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 1655 billion gallons in 2013 and increases to 360 billion gallons by 2022 the rfs2 presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use gasoline consumption has been lower than forecasted by the epa which has led to concerns that the renewable fuel volumes may not be met as a result the epa delayed issuance of the 2014 rfs2 standards and has not finalized the 2015 renewable fuel volumes as required by the november 30 2014 statutory deadline the advanced biofuels program a subset of the rfs2 requirements creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations 

tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may further reduce refined product margins 

 on march 3 2014 the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards the final tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million “ppm” beginning in calendar year 2017 in addition gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum pergallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm we anticipate that we will spend an estimated 750 million to 1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards 

we have in the past owned or operated and currently own and operate convenience stores and other locations with usts in various states the operation of usts poses risks including soil and groundwater contamination at our previously or currently operated locations such contamination could result in substantial cleanup costs fines or civil liabilities 

we have in the past and will continue to dispose of various wastes at lawful disposal sites environmental laws including cercla and similar state laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when performed 

any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal penalties injunctions limiting our operations investigatory or remedial liabilities or impediments to construction of additional facilities or equipment 

plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies 

our anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets however policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence of environmental and other special interest groups the construction of new refinery processing units or crude oil or refined products pipelines or the extension or expansion of existing assets involve numerous political and legal uncertainties many of which may cause significant delays or cost increases and most of which are beyond our control delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing gross margins 

the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies producing companies and trading companies including suppliers from canada the middle east and various other international locations the market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market we are therefore subject to the attendant political geographic and economic risks of such a market if one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our operations sales of refined products and refining and marketing gross margins could be adversely affected materially and adversely impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult andor costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability for example the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use payroll franchise withholding and property taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties 

terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

the us government has issued warnings that energy assets in general including the nation’s refining pipeline and terminal infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations the threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks any future terrorist attacks on our facilities those of our customers and in some cases those of other pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

an easing or lifting of the us crude oil export ban could adversely affect crack spreads or crude oil price differentials and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

since the 1970s the us has restricted the ability of producers to export domestic crude oil as total crude oil production has increased in the us in recent years primarily due to the increase in shale crude oil production there have been increasing calls by crude oil producers and others for an easing or lifting of the crude oil export ban if the export ban were to be significantly eased or lifted the price of domestic crude oil would likely rise potentially impacting crack spreads and price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils a deterioration of crack spreads or price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results or operations and cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 

 we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

the location and general character of our refineries convenience stores pipeline systems and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1 business and are incorporated herein by reference the plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency in addition we believe that our properties and facilities are adequate for our operations and that our facilities are adequately maintained as of december 31 2014  we were the lessee under a number of cancellable and noncancellable leases for certain properties including land and building space office equipment storage facilities and transportation equipment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25  for additional information regarding our leases 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are the subject of or a party to a number of pending or threatened legal actions contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters including laws and regulations relating to the environment some of these matters are discussed below 

litigation 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty while it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

kentucky emergency pricing litigation 

in may 2007 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against us and marathon oil in state court in franklin county kentucky for alleged violations of kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws following hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 the lawsuit alleges that we overcharged customers by 89 million during september and october 2005 the complaint seeks disgorgement of these sums as well as penalties under kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws we are vigorously defending this litigation we believe that this is the first lawsuit for damages and injunctive relief under the kentucky emergency pricing laws to progress this far and it contains many novel issues in may 2011 the kentucky attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in april and may 2011 under statewide price controls that were activated by the kentucky governor on april 26 2011 and which have since expired the court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief and the remainder of the 2011 claims likely will be resolved along with those dating from 2005 if the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably in its entirety it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse effect 

environmental proceedings 

during 2001 we entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act and other violations with the epa covering our refineries the settlement committed us to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to our refineries which are now complete we are working with the epa to terminate the new source review consent decree 

in january 2011 the epa notified us of alleged violations of various statutory and regulatory provisions related to motor fuels some of which we had previously selfreported to the epa subsequently we selfreported four additional alleged clean air act violations related to motor fuels to the epa in july 2014 we tentatively agreed to pay a 275 million civil penalty as well as undertake certain projects to reduce emissions in august and december 2014 we selfreported three similar alleged violations to the epa the epa has agreed to include these incidents in the consent decree and increased the civil penalty demand to 29 million we believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we have been subject to a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency and the illinois attorney general’s office since 2002 concerning selfreporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at the robinson illinois refinery as a result of these allegations we tentatively agreed to pay 150000 civil penalty and undertake a supplemental environmental project involving the installation of ambient air monitors at the refinery 

the consent order is not yet finalized but the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

on january 3 2013 the louisiana department of environmental quality “ldeq” issued a consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty alleging violations related to selfreported air emission events occurring at our garyville louisiana refinery between the years of 2005 and 2011 it is possible the ldeq could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with this matter 

we are involved in a number of other environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business while the ultimate outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

executive summary 

results 

select results for 2014  and 2013  are reflected in the following table 



net income attributable to mpc increased 412 million or 214 per diluted share  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to our refining  marketing segment 

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 403 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher us gulf coast “usgc” and chicago crack spreads partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs 

speedway segment income from operations increased 169 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to increases in gasoline and distillate gross margin and merchandise gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses these increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of convenience stores from hess 

pipeline transportation segment income from operations increased 70 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to higher  pipeline transportation revenue and an increase  in income from our pipeline affiliates partially offset by an increase  in operating expenses 

mplx lp 

in 2012 we formed mplx a master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on october 31 2012 mplx completed its initial public offering of 199 million common units which represented the sale by us of a 264 percent interest in mplx 

as of december 31 2014  we owned a 715 percent  interest in mplx including the two percent  general partner interest and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest 

mplx’s initial assets consisted of a 51 percent  general partner interest in pipe line holdings which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states and a 100 percent  interest in a butane storage cavern in west virginia we originally retained a 49 percent limited partner interest in pipe line holdings 

on may 1 2013 we sold a five percent  interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for 100 million  which was financed by mplx with cash on hand 

on march 1 2014 we sold mplx a 13 percent  interest in pipe line holdings for 310 million  mplx financed this transaction with 40 million  of cash onhand and 270 million  of borrowings on its bank revolving credit agreement 

on october 30 2014 we announced plans to substantially accelerate the growth of mplx which is expected to provide unitholders an average annual distribution growth rate percentage in the mid20s over the next five years as we build meaningful scale more quickly we believe this increased scale provides mplx greater flexibility to fund organic projects and to pursue acquisition opportunities 

on december 1 2014 we sold and contributed interests in pipe line holdings totaling 305 percent  to mplx for 600 million  in cash and 29 million  mplx common units valued at 200 million  mplx financed the sales portion of this transaction with 600 million  of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility 

the sales and contribution of our interests in pipe line holdings to mplx resulted in a change of our ownership in pipe line holdings but not a change in control we accounted for these sales as transactions between entities under common control and did not record a gain or loss 

on december 8 2014 mplx completed a public offering of 35 million  common units at a price to the public of 6668  per common unit with net proceeds of 221 million  mplx used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes on december 10 2014 we exercised our right to maintain our two percent general partner interest in mplx by purchasing 130 thousand  general partner units for 9 million  

on february 12 2015 mplx completed its initial underwritten public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due february 15 2025 the “senior notes” the senior notes were offered at a price to the public of 9964 percent of par the net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility as well as for general partnership purposes 

the following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from mplx during 2014  and 2013  



the market value of the 19980619  mplx common units and 36951515  mplx subordinated units we owned at december 31 2014  was 418 billion  based on the december 31 2014  closing unit price of 7349  over time we also believe there will be substantial value attributable to our general partnership interests 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 4  for additional information on mplx 

acquisitions and investments 

on september 30 2014 we acquired from hess all of its retail locations transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines including approximately 40  mbpd on colonial pipeline for 282 billion  we refer to these assets as “hess’ retail operations and related assets” and substantially all of these assets are part of our speedway segment this acquisition significantly expands our speedway presence from nine  to 22  states throughout the east coast and southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow highervalued stable cash flow businesses this acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations providing an outlet for an incremental 200  mbpd of assured sales from our refining system the transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for hess’ retail operations and related assets 

in july 2014 we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in enbridge inc’s sax pipeline which will run from flanagan ill to patoka ill and is expected to be operational in late 2015 this option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the sax pipeline and our commitment to the sandpiper pipeline project during 2014  we made contributions of 120 million  to illinois extension pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs incurredtodate on the sax pipeline project 

on april 1 2014 we purchased a facility in cincinnati ohio from felda iffco sdn bhd malaysia for 40 million  the plant currently produces biodiesel glycerin and other byproducts the capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million  gallons per year 

in march 2014 we acquired from chevron raven ridge pipe line company an additional seven percent  interest in explorer for 77 million  bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent  due to this increase in our ownership percentage we now account for our investment in explorer using the equity method of accounting and report explorer as a related party explorer owns approximately 1900 miles of refined products pipeline from lake charles louisiana to hammond indiana 

in november 2013 we agreed with enbridge energy partners to serve as an anchor shipper for the sandpiper pipeline which will run from beaver lodge north dakota to superior wisconsin we also agreed to fund 375 percent  of the construction of the sandpiper pipeline project which is currently estimated to cost 26 billion of which approximately 10 billion is our share we made contributions of 192 million  during 2014  and have contributed 216 million  since project inception in exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in enbridge energy partners’ north dakota system when the sandpiper pipeline is placed into service which is expected to be in 2017 enbridge energy partners’ north dakota system currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long we will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements 

on august 1 2013  we acquired from mitsui  co usa inc its interests in three  ethanol companies for 75 million  under the purchase agreement we acquired an additional 24 percent  interest in tace bringing our ownership interest to 60 percent  a 34 percent  interest in taei which holds a 50 percent  ownership in tame bringing our direct and indirect ownership interest in tame to 67 percent  and a 40 percent  interest in taae which owns an ethanol production facility in albion michigan on october 1 2013 our ownership interest in taae increased to 43 percent  as a result of taae acquiring one of the owner’s interest we hold a noncontrolling interest in each of these entities and account for them using the equity method of accounting since the minority owners have substantive participating rights 

on february 1 2013 we acquired from bp the 451000 barrel per calendar day refinery in texas city texas three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery four light product terminals brandedjobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1200 branded sites a 1040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 mbpd allocation of space on the colonial pipeline we refer to these assets as the “galveston bay refinery and related assets” we paid 149 billion for these assets which included 935 million for inventory pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement we may also be required to pay bp a contingent earnout of up to an additional 700 million over six years subject to certain conditions in july 2014 we paid bp 180 million  for the first period’s contingent earnout these assets are part of our refining  marketing and pipeline transportation segments our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for the galveston bay refinery and related assets 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5  for additional information on these acquisitions and investments see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 26  for information regarding our future contributions to the sax pipeline project and the sandpiper pipeline project 

share repurchases 

on july 30 2014 our board of directors approved an additional 20 billion  share repurchase authorization expiring in july 2016  as of december 31 2014  our board of directors had approved 80 billion  in total share repurchase authorizations since january 1 2012 and we have repurchased a total of 627 billion  of our common stock under these authorizations leaving 173 billion  available for repurchases under these authorizations we have acquired 89 million  shares at an average cost per share of 7035  

liquidity 

as of december 31 2014  we had cash and cash equivalents of 149 billion  and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our 25 billion  revolving credit agreement or 13 billion  trade receivables securitization facility as of january 31 2015 eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of 700 million  mplx had 385 million  of borrowings outstanding under its 1 billion  revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2014  

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to the estimated construction costs timing and completion of the sandpiper and sax pipeline projects and the share repurchase authorizations factors that could affect the estimated construction costs timing and completion of the sandpiper and sax pipeline projects include but are not limited to availability of materials and labor unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and thirdparty approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include but are not limited to business conditions availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining  marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs 

our refining  marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants we calculate midwest chicago and usgc crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products lls prices and a 6321 ratio of products 6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline 2 barrels of ultralow sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil are used for these crackspread calculations 

refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like brent crude in recent years domestic us crude oils such as wti and lls traded at prices less than brent due to the growth in us crude oil production logistical constraints and other market factors these price discounts compared to brent favorably impacted the lls 6321 crack spread during 2011 and continuing through the first half of 2013 wti traded at prices significantly less than brent and lls which favorably impacted our refining  marketing gross margin the differential between wti and lls significantly narrowed during the second half of 2013 with a further narrowing broadly continuing through 2014 in addition the differential between lls and brent narrowed significantly during the second half of 2014 the spread between domestic crude oils and brent could remain narrow if there is a change in existing us energy policy regarding crude oil exports or if low crude oil prices reduce us crude oil production growth substantially if either were to occur it could reduce our refining  marketing gross margin 

our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil the amount of this discount the sweetsour differential can vary significantly causing our refining  marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil in general a larger sweetsour differential will enhance our refining  marketing gross margin 

future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors as well as us energy policy 

the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions   

 in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sweetsour differential and the discount of wti to lls our refining  marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as 

 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the cost of our crude oil and refined product inventories is determined under the last in first out “lifo” method during periods of rapidly declining prices the lifo cost basis of our crude oil and refined product inventories may have to be written down to market value despite a significant drop in refined product prices in 2014 we determined that the lifo cost basis of our crude oil and refined product inventories was recoverable as of december 31 2014  if prices decrease further in 2015 we may be required to recognize a lower of cost or market adjustment to these inventories which totaled approximately 96 million barrels as of december 31 2014  

refining  marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs which include turnaround and major maintenance depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs planned major maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years 



the table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at december 31 of each year 



 speedway 

our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees impacts the speedway segment profitability numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year including local competition seasonal demand fluctuations the available wholesale supply the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions gasoline demand in padd 2 is estimated to have grown by about half a percent in 2014 after climbing by 14 percent in 2013 meanwhile gasoline demand in padd 1 is estimated to have grown by 15 percent in 2014 after a 15 percent decline in 2013 reversing a threeyear trend of declines and returning to 2012 levels strong economic growth in the last three quarters of 2014 and strongly falling prices throughout the second half supported gasoline demand distillate demand was supported by severe winter temperatures in early 2014 and a very strong harvest season padd 2 distillate demand is estimated to have grown by 37 percent in 2014 after climbing by 16 percent in 2013 padd 1 estimated distillate demand grew over five percent after climbing by 88 percent in 2013 market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize the gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to speedway’s gross margin more than half of speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2014  speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items 

pipeline transportation 

the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining  marketing segment in 2012 new transportation services agreements were entered into between mpc and mplx which resulted in higher tariff rates the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 



net income attributable to mpc increased 412 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased 128 billion in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to our refining  marketing segment income from operations which increased 403 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased 189 billion in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase  in refining  marketing segment income from operations in 2014  was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher usgc and chicago crack spreads partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs  the decrease in 2013 was primarily due to   narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes  

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes decreased 234 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 1792 billion in 2013 compared to 2012  the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to  lower refined product sales prices partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes and higher merchandise sales for our speedway segment primarily attributable to the convenience stores acquired from hess the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  higher refined product sales volumes which were primarily associated with the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery in february 2013 partially offset by a decrease  in refined product sales prices consolidated refined product sales increased 52 mbpd in 2014 compared to 2013 and 468 mbpd in 2013 compared to 2012  

income from equity method investments increased 117 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and 10 million in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to  increases in income from our ethanol affiliates of 68 million and income from our pipeline affiliates of 49 million the increase in income from our ethanol affiliates includes the affects of our acquisition of interests in taae tace and taei in august 2013 the higher income from our pipeline affiliates is primarily due to increases from loop llc “loop” and explorer which is now accounted for as an equity method investment following our acquisition of an increased ownership interest in this pipeline company the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  an increase in income from our ethanol investments of 34 million partially offset by a decrease in income from our investment in loop of 17 million the increase in income from ethanol investments was primarily due to higher income in 2013 compared to 2012 and the acquisition of interests in taae tace and taei in 2013 

net gain on disposal of assets increased 15 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased 171 million in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to the sale of two terminals and terminal assets in 2014 and a 171 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our minnesota assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6  for additional information on the minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement agreement with the buyer 

other income increased 59 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and 6 million in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to  higher gains on sales of excess renewable identification numbers “rins” of 74 million partially offset by an 11 million impairment in 2014 of an investment in a company accounted for using the cost method the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  higher gains on sales of excess rins and dividends received from a pipeline affiliate partially offset by the absence of 12 million of dividends received from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our minnesota assets during the third quarter of 2012 

cost of revenues decreased 363 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 1873 billion in 2013 compared to 2012  the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to  

 the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  

 purchases from related parties increased 148 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and 77 million in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to  acquisitions of ownership interests in taae in august 2013 and explorer in march 2014 resulting in purchases from these companies totaling 118 million  in 2014  and 24 million  in 2013  being reported as purchases from related parties while purchases from these companies prior to these acquisitions were reported as cost of revenues in addition we also had an increase in purchases from loop of 45 million  in 2014  the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  higher ethanol volumes purchased from our ethanol investments partially offset by lower ethanol prices and decreases in purchases from pipeline affiliates including centennial pipeline llc “centennial” 

consumer excise taxes increased 422 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and 554 million in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to increases in taxable refined product sales volumes including the effects of the acquisitions of the galveston bay refinery and related assets and hess’ retail operations and related assets 

depreciation and amortization increased 106 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and 225 million in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to  completion of certain capital investments at our galveston bay refinery an increase in the number of convenience stores in our speedway segment and the implementation of corporatelevel information technology projects partially offset by an impairment of a light products terminal in 2013 the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit michigan refinery in late 2012 and our acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets in february 2013 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 127 million in 2014 compared to 2013  primarily due to increases in contract services employee compensation and benefit expenses and credit card processing fees 

other taxes increased 50 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and 70 million in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to  increases in property taxes of 30 million payroll taxes of 27 million and environmental taxes of 11 million partially offset by decreases in other tax expenses these increases were attributable to a number of factors including the acquisitions of the galveston bay refinery and related assets and hess’ retail operations and related assets and the absence of a federal oil spill tax refund received in 2013 the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  increases in property taxes of 41 million payroll taxes of 21 million and sales and use tax expense of 13 million the increases in 2013 were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit refinery the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets and speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 

net interest and other financial costs increased 37 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and 70 million in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to  an increase in longterm debt related to the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets and mplx’s acquisition of additional interest in pipe line holdings the increase in 2013 was primarily due to   a decrease  in capitalized interest in 2013 due to the completion of the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project in late 2012 we capitalized interest of 27 million  in 2014  28 million  in 2013  and 101 million  in 2012  

provision for income taxes increased 167 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased 732 million in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to our income before income taxes which increased 589 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased 199 billion in 2013 compared to 2012  the effective tax rates in 2014  2013  and 2012  are equivalent to or slightly less than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences including the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 13  for further details 

segment results 

revenues are summarized by segment in the following table 



refining  marketing segment revenues decreased 318 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 1820 billion in 2013 compared to 2012  the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to   lower  refined product sales prices partially offset by an increase  in refined product sales volumes the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  an increase in refined product sales volumes related to the galveston bay refinery acquired in february 2013 partially offset by lower refined product selling prices the table below shows our refining  marketing segment refined product sales volumes and prices 



 the table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas 



refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment increased 162 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and 512 million in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to increases  in intersegment refined product sales volumes partially offset by lower  refined product sales prices the increase  in intersegment refined product sales volumes for 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of convenience stores from hess 



speedway segment revenues increased 246 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 and 232 million in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to increases  in gasoline and distillate sales of 198 billion  and 138 million  respectively and increases  in merchandise sales of 476 million  and 77 million  respectively the increases  in gasoline and distillate sales were primarily due to volume increases  of 796 million gallons  and 119 million gallons  respectively primarily due to increases  in the number of convenience stores partially offset by decreases  in gasoline and distillate selling prices of 020 per gallon  and 009 per gallon  respectively the increases  in merchandise sales were primarily due to increases  in the number of convenience stores and higher same store sales the increase in the number of convenience stores for 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of convenience stores from hess 

the following table includes certain revenue statistics for the speedway segment 



 pipeline transportation segment revenue increased 60 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and 78 million in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to   an increase  in revenue related to volume deficiency credits and higher average tariffs received on crude oil and refined products shipped partially offset by lower refined products and crude oil pipeline throughput volumes the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped higher crude oil throughput volumes and an increase in storage fees and other revenue 

the following table includes throughput volumes for the pipeline transportation segment

income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table 



 refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 403 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased 189 billion in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to   more favorable net product price realizations and higher usgc and chicago crack spreads partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs  the decrease in 2013 was primarily due to   narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes  

the following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business 



 based on the market indicators above and our refinery throughputs we estimate the following impacts on refining  marketing segment income from operations for 2014  compared to 2013  and for 2013  compared to 2012  

 52 

 the market indicators shown above use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold differences in our results compared to these market indicators including product price realizations mix and crude costs as well as other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances had estimated positive impacts on refining  marketing segment income of 173 billion  in 2014  compared to 2013  and 298 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  we estimate the positive  impact for 2014  was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations as compared to spot market values and a favorable effect from valuing year end inventories using the lifo method of accounting we estimate the positive  impact for 2013  was primarily due to favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs compared to market indicators partially offset by lower product price realizations 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recognized a build in our crude oil and refined products inventories for purposes of our annual lifo inventory costing this increase in inventory is recorded based on pricing at the beginning of 2014 which was substantially higher than fourth quarter prices as a result refining  marketing segment income for the fourth quarter reflects a favorable effect of approximately 240 million comparing 2014 to 2013 the favorable lifo impact was approximately 130 million 

the following table summarizes our refinery throughputs 



total refinery throughputs increased 439 mbpd in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to the galveston bay refinery which we acquired on february 1 2013 

the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the refining  marketing segment 



 53 

refinery direct operating costs increased 137 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013 and 111 per barrel in 2013 compared to 2012  which include increases  in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of 060  per barrel and 020  per barrel respectively and increases  in other manufacturing costs of 072  per barrel and 099  per barrel respectively the increase  in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2014  was primarily attributable to the galveston bay robinson and catlettsburg refineries partially offset by decreases at the garyville and canton refineries the increase  in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2013  was primarily attributable to the galveston bay refinery the increases  in other manufacturing costs were primarily attributable to higher energy costs catalyst expenses and routine maintenance costs for 2014 and the addition of the galveston bay refinery for 2013 which had higher operating costs per barrel of throughput than the average of our other six refineries 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance our expenses associated with purchased rins were 141 million  in 2014  264 million  in 2013  and 105 million  in 2012  the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to  decreases in the average cost of ethanol and biomassbased biodiesel rins and decreases in our estimated advanced biofuel and ethanol obligation volumes the increase in 2013 was primarily due to  increases in the average cost of ethanol and biodiesel rins 

speedway segment income from operations increased 169 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and 65 million in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to increases  in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of 246 million  and 54 million  respectively and increases  in our merchandise gross margin of 150 million  and 30 million  respectively partially offset by higher operating expenses the increases were primarily attributable to increases in the number of convenience stores which for 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of convenience stores from hess the increases in merchandise gross margin were related to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins the convenience stores acquired from hess contributed 113 million to speedway segment income from operations in 2014 

the following table includes margin statistics for the speedway segment 



 pipeline transportation segment income from operations increased 70 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased 6 million in 2013 compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to   higher  pipeline transportation revenue and an increase  in income from our pipeline affiliates which was primarily attributable to our investment in loop partially offset by an increase  in operating expenses primarily attributable to the proposed cornerstone pipeline project and pipeline maintenance costs the decrease in 2013 was primarily due to  higher operating expenses and depreciation and lower pipeline affiliate income partially offset by higher transportation revenue the higher expenses and revenues were primarily attributable to the formation of mplx 

corporate and other unallocated expenses increased 15 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased 65 million in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of hess’ retail operations and related assets in 2014 and lower unallocated employee benefit expenses and lower employee incentive compensation expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 

we recognized a gain of 183 million in 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our minnesota assets which included 86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6  for additional information on the minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer 

we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of 96 million  in 2014  95 million  in 2013  and 124 million  in 2012  resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during these years

net cash provided by operating activities decreased   295 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to unfavorable  changes in working capital of 892 million  compared to 2013 partially offset by an increase  in net income of 422 million  and noncash income adjustments of 175 million  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 109 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to decreases in net income of 126 billion and noncash income adjustments of 453 million partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of 626 million compared to 2012 

for 2014  changes in working capital were a net 694 million   use  of cash primarily due to a decrease  in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase  in inventories partially offset by a decrease  in current receivables changes from december 31 2013  to december 31 2014  per the consolidated balance sheets excluding the impact of acquisitions were as follows 

 for 2013 changes in working capital were a net 198 million source of cash primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventory volumes accounts payable increased 145 billion from yearend 2012 primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes and current receivables increased 949 million from yearend 2012 primarily due to higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes both of these increases are associated with the galveston bay refinery acquired in february 2013 changes in inventories were a 305 million use of cash in 2013 primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes 

for 2012 changes in working capital were a net 428 million use of cash primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and payable volumes partially offset by a decrease in current receivables resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and receivable volumes

the senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 

the term loan agreement the credit agreement and the mplx credit agreement contain representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types the financial covenant included in the term loan agreement and the mpc credit agreement requires us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization as defined in the term loan agreement and the mpc credit agreement of no greater than 065 to 100 as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 033  to 100 as well as the other covenants contained in the term loan agreement and the mpc credit agreement

our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile as of february 9 2015 the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

neither the credit agreement the mplx credit agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under the credit agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could under certain circumstances decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements 

capital requirements

we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market repurchases negotiated block transactions accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing and amount of future repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time 

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to share repurchase authorizations factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include but are not limited to business conditions availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements

refining  marketing 

the refining  marketing segment’s 2015  capital budget is 128 billion  which includes 234 million  for midstream assets approximately 370 million  for refining margin enhancement projects and approximately 675 million  for refinerysustaining capital a number of these projects span multiple years 

the 234 million  budgeted for midstream assets includes projects that will allow us to process condensate from the utica shale region and grow gulf coast export capabilities we have a project to build a condensate splitter at our catlettsburg refinery to allow it to process up to 35  mbpcd of condensate from the utica shale region that we expect to complete in 2015 we began operation of a condensate splitter at our canton refinery at the end of 2014 to allow it to process up to 25  mbpcd of condensate we have projects at our galveston bay and garyville refineries to increase export capabilities by 165  mbpd by 2018 in 2015 we expect to complete projects representing 50 mbpd of that total 

the 370 million  budgeted for refining margin enhancement projects includes projects that will allow us to increase our diesel production and to process light crude oil from the utica shale region at our garyville refinery we completed a hydrocracker expansion in the first quarter of 2014 that increased the hydrocracker capacity to 110 mbpcd and we expect to complete a project to expand the distillate hydrotreater by 10 mbpcd in the first quarter of 2015 at our galveston bay refinery we have a hydrocracker project designed to increase our ulsd production by nine mbpd by shifting yields from gasoline which we expect to complete in 2015 at our robinson refinery we have a similar project to revamp our distillate hydrocracker to improve margins by processing more feedstock at a lower conversion and shifting approximately five mbpd of light products to ulsd production and a project to increase the light crude oil processing capacity by 30  mbpcd which will allow it to run 100 percent light crude oil we expect to complete these projects in 2015 and 2016 respectively 

during 2014 we worked on a frontend engineering and design study for a residual fuel hydrocracker project at our garyville refinery intended to increase margins by upgrading residual fuel to ulsd and gas oil we are deferring a final investment decision on this project with estimated total costs of 22 billion to 25 billion as we further evaluate the implications of current market conditions on the project as of december 31 2014 we have capitalized 90 million of costs associated with this project if a decision is made to not pursue this project there could be a future impairment of the costs incurred for the project 

the remaining 675 million  budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements at our refineries

corporate and other 

the remaining 2015  capital budget includes 140 million  primarily related to an expansion project for our corporate headquarters and upgrades to information technology systems 

our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forwardlooking statements are based on currently available information if this information proves to be inaccurate future availability of financing may be adversely affected factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided by operating activities the state of worldwide debt and equity markets investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance the global financial climate and in particular with respect to borrowings the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies the discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forwardlooking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending costs for projects under construction project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth upgrades and expansion the forwardlooking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance actual results may differ materially from these expectations estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products actions of competitors delays in obtaining necessary thirdparty approvals changes in labor materials and equipment costs and availability planned and unplanned outages the delay of cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects project cost overruns disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response and other operating and economic considerations 

transactions with related parties 

we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8  for discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers for additional information see item 1a risk factors 

our environmental expenditures including nonregulatory expenditures for each of the last three years were 



 we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation or regulations it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for five  percent four  percent and eight  percent of capital expenditures excluding the acquisitions of the galveston bay refinery and related assets and hess’ retail operations and related assets in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 250 million  or ten  percent of total capital expenditures in 2015  predictions beyond 2015  can only be broadbased estimates which have varied and will continue to vary due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies among other matters based on currently identified projects we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately 410 million  in 2016  however actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

 valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 18  for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 

 impairment assessments of longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions significant assumptions include 

 we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a poor outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes significant reduction in refining margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets site level for speedway segment convenience stores or the pipeline system level for pipeline transportation segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value 

unlike longlived assets goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at december 31 2014  we had a total of 157 billion  of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value for each of our reporting units in 2014  

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value at december 31 2014  we had 865 million  of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2014 at december 31 2014  centennial was not shipping product as a result we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in centennial we concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of centennial’s assets if market conditions were to change and the owners of centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets there could be a future impairment of our centennial interest as of december 31 2014  our equity investment in centennial was 36 million  and we had a 38 million  guarantee associated with 50 percent of centennial’s outstanding debt see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 26  for additional information on the debt guarantee 

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to the carrying value of our centennial equity investment factors that could affect the carrying value of our centennial equity investment include but are not limited to a change in business conditions a further decline or improvement in the longterm outlook of the potential uses of centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

acquisitions 

in accounting for business combinations acquired assets and liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired if any is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain respectively a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property plant and equipment intangible assets contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and for certain acquisitions engage thirdparty consultants for assistance 

the fair value of assets and liabilities including contingent consideration as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches including the income approach which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate the cost approach which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entityspecific differences the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 

the fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to bp is remeasured each quarter using an income approach with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues the amount of cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a marketbased crack spread and refinery throughput volumes for the months during which the contract applies as well as established thresholds that cap the annual and total payment we used internal and external forecasts for the crack spread and internal forecasts for refinery throughput volumes and applied an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate to the range of cash flows indicated by various scenarios to determine the fair value of the arrangement see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5  for additional information on our acquisitions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 18  for additional information on fair value measurements 

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 18  additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 

 66 

we utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuary’s discount rate model this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 365 percent for our pension plans and 415 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 42 million and 32 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 2 million and 4 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 51 percent equity securities and 49 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness after evaluating activity in the capital markets along with the current and projected plan investments we reduced the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 700 percent to 675 percent effective for 2015 we used the 700 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2014 defined benefit pension expense decreasing the 675 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 4 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

we utilized the 2014 mortality tables from the us society of actuaries 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 23  includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

contingent liabilities 

we accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions claims litigation environmental remediation tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and thirdparty indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable we regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons for instance settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes which are recorded as other taxes for additional information on contingent liabilities see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – environmental matters and compliance costs 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

in february 2015 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standards update making targeted changes to the current consolidation guidance the new standard changes the way certain decisions are made related to substantive rights related parties and decision making fees when applying the vie consolidation model and eliminates certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model the update is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is permitted at this point we have not determined the impact of the new standards update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

in august 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances management will be required to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether management’s plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt the accounting standards update will be effective for the first annual period ending after december 15 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted 

in june 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update for the elimination of the concept of development stage entity “dse” from us gaap and removes the related incremental reporting the standards update eliminates the additional financial statement requirements specific to a dse in addition it amends the consolidation model by eliminating the special provisions in the variable interest entity rules for assessing the sufficiency of the equity of a dse the portion of the accounting standards update related to the amendment to the consolidation guidance will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted the portion of the accounting standards update related to the removal of the dse reporting requirements will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2014 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted adoption of this standards update in the first quarters of 2015 and 2016 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update for revenue recognition that is aligned with the international accounting standards board’s revenue recognition standard issued on the same day the guidance in the update states that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach including identifying the contract identifying the separate performance obligations determining the transaction price allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations are satisfied additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized the accounting standards update will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those years with no early adoption permitted at this point we have not determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that redefines the criteria for determining discontinued operations and introduces new disclosures related to these disposals the updated definition of a discontinued operation is the disposal of a component or components of an entity or the classification of a component or components of an entity as held for sale that represents a strategic shift for an entity and has or will have a major impact on an entity’s operations and financial results the standard requires disclosure of additional financial information for discontinued operations and individually material components not qualifying for discontinued operation presentation as well as information regarding an entity’s continuing involvement with the discontinued operation the accounting standards update is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2014 and interim periods within those years early adoption is permitted adoption of this standards update in the first quarter of 2015 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2014  we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes 18  and 19  for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also authorize the use of the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below lastin firstout inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts for crude oil refined products and ethanol 

we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the table below sets forth information relating to our significant open commodity derivative contracts as of december 31 2014  

  



a   97 percent  of these contracts expire in the first quarter of 2015 

b   100  percent of these contracts expire in the first quarter of 2015 

c  chicago mercantile exchange “cme” 

d  intercontinental exchange “ice” 

e  reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending “rbob” 

sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2014  is provided in the following table 



we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2014  would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations related to our debt obligations at december 31 2014  our debt was primarily comprised of the 30 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued on february 1 2011 and the 195 billion  aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes issued september 5 2014 additionally we have 950 million of variable rate term debt 

sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint change in interest rates on longterm debt as of december 31 2014  is provided in the following table fair value of cash and cash equivalents receivables accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the shortterm maturity of the instruments accordingly these instruments are excluded from the table 

  



 at december 31 2014  our portfolio of longterm debt was comprised of fixedrate instruments and variablerate borrowings under the term loan agreement and the mplx credit agreement the fair value of our fixedrate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixedrate debt at prices above carrying value interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the term loan agreement and the mplx credit agreement but will affect our results of operations and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2014  

counterparty risk 

we are also exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties or futures commission merchants we regularly review the creditworthiness of counterparties and futures commission merchants and enter into master netting agreements when appropriate 

forwardlooking statements 

these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forwardlooking statements with respect to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil other refinery feedstocks refined products and ethanol if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2014  the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

internal control over financial reporting and changes in internal control over financial reporting 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and – report of independent registered public accounting firm which reports are incorporated herein by reference 

during the quarter ended december 31 2014  we acquired hess’ retail operations and related assets the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures does not include hess’ retail operations and related assets there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 




 item 9b other information 

on february 24 2015 the compensation committee of our board of directors the “committee” approved and authorized a retirement lump sum benefit supplement as further described below the “service benefit” to the respective formulaic benefit to be received under the marathon petroleum excess benefit plan the “plan” by marathon petroleum corporation named executive officers gary r heminger and anthony r kenney should they individually elect to continue service as our employee beyond the age of 62 the plan was amended and restated by the committee on october 29 2014 and such amended and restated plan is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k the “revised plan” while the revised plan permits the committee on a discretionary basis to extend the service benefit to individual officers of marathon petroleum corporation the amendment and restatement of the plan by itself had no material impact on the defined benefit plan compensation of our named executive officers prior to the committee’s subsequent action on february 24 2015 

the plan is an unfunded nonqualified retirement plan for the benefit of a select group of management including our named executive officers and highly compensated employees the plan generally provides benefits that participants would have otherwise received under the taxqualified marathon petroleum retirement plan the “retirement plan” were it not for internal revenue code limitations due to the structure of the legacy final average pay benefit formula within the retirement plan the agerelated lump sum benefit conversion factors used to calculate lump sum benefits under the plan result in a yeartoyear decrease in the lump sum benefit for participants generally beginning on or after the age of 59 as a result even if participants want to continue their employment with us after they reach age 59 their lump sum benefit may decline yeartoyear 

the service benefit will not correct for any agerelated erosion of benefit occurring prior to age 62 but for those officers selected by the committee in its sole discretion the service benefit will correct for the agerelated erosion of benefit from age 62 until such officer’s actual retirement date or date of death as described herein if an officer to whom the service benefit has been extended by the committee retires or dies 1 after reaching age 62 and 2 while in service as our active employee such officer will be eligible to receive a retirement lump sum benefit supplement calculated as follows 

 126 

 as designed by the committee the service benefit does not compensate for unfavorable fluctuations in the lump sum interest rate and is in fact structured to prevent payment of a retirement lump sum benefit supplement greater than intended within a favorable interest rate environment the service benefit is designed to correct only for the benefit erosion an officer may experience for continued service should he or she elect to remain our employee beyond the age of 62 

the foregoing description of the plan the revised plan and the service benefit are summary in nature and subject to and qualified in their entirety by the full text of the revised plan a copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit 1014 and is incorporated herein by reference

our competitive strengths 

high quality asset base 

we believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the midwest and the fourth largest in the united states based on crude oil refining capacity we own a seven plant refinery network with approximately 17  million barrels per calendar day “mmbpcd” of crude oil throughput capacity our refineries process a wide range of crude oils including heavy and sour crude oils which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates specialty chemicals and other refined products 

strategic location 

the geographic locations of our refineries and our extensive midstream distribution system provide us with strategic advantages located in petroleum administration for defense district “padd” ii and padd iii which consist of states in the midwest and the gulf coast regions of the united states our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources including domestic canadian and other foreign sources which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs for example geographic proximity to various united states shale oil regions and canadian crude oil supply sources allows our refineries access to priceadvantaged crude oils and lower transportation costs than certain of our competitors our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access export markets and to serve a broad range of key enduser markets across the united states quickly and costeffectively 

  

 extensive midstream distribution networks 

our assets give us extensive flexibility and optionality to respond promptly to dynamic market conditions including weatherrelated and marketplace disruptions we believe the relative scale of our transportation and distribution assets and operations distinguishes us from other refining and marketing companies we currently own lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8300  miles of crude oil and products pipelines through our ownership interests in mplx and pipe line holdings we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the united states on the basis of total volume delivered we also own one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the united states as well as trucking and rail assets we operate this system in coordination with our refining and marketing network which enables us to optimize feedstock and raw material supplies and refined product distribution and further allows for important economies of scale across our system 

attractive growth opportunities 

we believe we have attractive growth opportunities over the next three years we expect to invest approximately 630 million in midstream assets that are part of our refining  marketing segment approximately 23 billion in our pipeline transportation segment and approximately 925 million to grow our speedway segment our refining  marketing segments midstream investments include increasing our capacity to process condensate from the utica shale region at our canton ohio 

and catlettsburg kentucky refineries our pipeline transportation segment investments include the opportunity to acquire equity interests in two pipeline projects that will transport crude oil from the growing north american hydrocarbon production to our refineries and building a pipeline to connect the utica shale production to our canton refinery 

our planned speedway segment investments include constructing new convenience stores and rebuilding existing locations we also anticipate acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions part of speedways growth strategy is to expand into new contiguous markets including western pennsylvania and tennessee in addition we have projects at our refineries to enhance refining margins expand our export capacity increase our distillate production and increase our capacity to process condensates and light crude oils 

general partner and sponsor of mplx 

our investment in mplx provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets mplx’s significant liquidity and borrowing capacity provides us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream logistics business our role as the general partner allows us to maintain strategic control of the assets so we can continue to optimize our refinery feedstock and distribution networks we have an extensive portfolio of assets that can potentially be sold to mplx providing mplx with a competitive advantage as of december 31 2013  these assets included 

 we broadly estimate these assets can generate annual earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization of 800 million we continue to focus resources on growing this portfolio of assets including investments in the sandpiper and southern access extension pipeline projects see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on these pipeline investments 

future asset sales to mplx along with sales of our limited partner interests in mplx will be driven by our desired distributable cash flow growth profile as well as strategic needs as they develop over time including generating funds to support our base dividend share repurchases and investment activities 

competitively positioned marketing operations 

we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area we have two strong retail brands speedway ®  and marathon ®  we believe our 1478  speedway ®  convenience stores which we operate through a whollyowned subsidiary speedway llc comprise the fourth largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states and was available through approximately 5200  retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 18  states as of december 31 2013  in addition as part of the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets we have retail marketing contracts where we continue to convert retail outlets to the marathon brand  we believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost 

established track record of profitability and diversified income stream 

we have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the refining cycle we believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results income generated by our speedway and pipeline transportation segments is less sensitive to business cycles while our refining  marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable 

strong financial position 

as of december 31 2013  we had 229 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and 38 billion  in unused committed borrowing facilities excluding mplx’s credit facility we also had 340 billion  of debt at yearend which represented only 23  percent of our total capitalization this combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage provides financial flexibility and allows us to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies 

our business strategies 

achieve and maintain toptier safety and environmental performance 

we remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations we have a history of safe and reliable operations which was demonstrated again in 2013 with a strong performance compared to the industry average four of our refineries have earned designation as a us occupational safety and health administration “osha” voluntary protection program “vpp” star site in addition we remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations while proactively meeting our regulatory requirements for example since taking over the galveston bay refinery we have improved environmental performance by reducing designated environmental incidents by approximately 80 percent compared to 2012 

grow highervalued stable cash flow businesses 

we intend to allocate significantly more capital to grow our midstream and retail businesses which typically have more predictable and stable income and cash flows compared to our refining operations we believe investors assign a higher value to businesses with stable cash flows over the next three years we expect to invest approximately 630 million in midstream assets that are part of our refining  marketing segment approximately 23 billion in our pipeline transportation segment and approximately 925 million on growing our speedway segment by contrast our total investment from 2011 through 2013 was 229 million  in midstream assets that are part of our refining  marketing segment 566 million  in our pipeline transportation segment and 800 million  in our speedway segment 

we expect there will be significant investments in infrastructure to connect growing north american crude oil production with existing refining assets and to move refined products to wholesale and retail marketing customers we intend to aggressively participate in this infrastructure buildout and mplx will be the entity through which we expect to grow our midstream business we intend to increase revenue on the mplx network of pipeline systems through higher utilization of existing assets by capitalizing on organic investment opportunities that may arise from the growth of mpc’s operations and from increased thirdparty activity in mplx’s areas of operations through mplx we also plan to pursue acquisitions of midstream assets both within our existing geographic footprint and in new areas 

we intend to grow speedway’s sales and profitability by focusing on organic growth through constructing new stores rebuilding old stores acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions and continuous improvement of existing operations for example we have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market in addition we began expanding speedway into new contiguous markets of western pennsylvania and tennessee in 2013 and are actively acquiring real estate in western pennsylvania and tennessee to be in a position to accelerate growth over the next several years in addition our industryleading speedy rewards ®  customer loyalty program which has more than 37 million active members provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our speedway customer base with existing and new speedway locations 

deliver top quartile refining performance 

our refineries are well positioned to benefit from the growing crude oil and condensate production in north america including the bakken eagle ford and utica shale regions along with the canadian oil sands we are also well positioned to export distillates gasoline and other products as the demand from various markets such as latin america and europe continues to grow 

we intend to enhance our margins in the refining  marketing segment by increasing our condensate and light crude oil processing capacity growing our distillate production and expanding our exports for example we have projects underway to increase condensate processing capacity at our canton and catlettsburg refineries to increase light crude oil processing capacity at our robinson illinois refinery to increase distillate production at our garyville louisiana galveston bay and robinson refineries and to expand the export capacity at our garyville and galveston bay refineries in addition we are evaluating a residual fuel hydrocracker project that we expect will increase garyvilles ultralowsulfur diesel ulsd production by 28 mbpd and lower feedstock costs we are also evaluating three projects to increase distillate production at our galveston bay refinery we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our existing asset base with an emphasis on increasing distillate production and export capabilities and opportunities at our galveston bay refinery 

sustain focus on shareholder returns 

we intend to continue our focus on the return of capital to shareholders in the form of a strong and growing base dividend supplemented by share repurchases we have increased our quarterly dividend by 110  percent since becoming a standalone company in june 2011 and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling 60 billion  through open market purchases and two accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs we repurchased 18  percent of our outstanding common shares since february 2012 for approximately 414 billion  after the effects of these repurchases 186 billion  of the 60 billion  total authorization was available for future repurchases as of december 31 2013  

increase assured sales volumes at our marathon brand and speedway locations 

we consider assured sales as those sales we make to marathon brand customers our speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts we believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations between our refineries our pipelines and our terminals the marathon brand has been a consistent vehicle for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets provides us with opportunities to further expand our southeast market presence as a result of this acquisition we have retail marketing contracts where we continue to convert retail outlets to the marathon brand  which puts us in position to take advantage of opportunities with premier jobbers and to significantly expand our brand presence in the southeast we also intend to grow speedway gasoline and distillate sales volumes through internal capital program growth projects and acquisitions that complement our existing store network including the continuing expansion into pennsylvania and tennessee 

utilize and enhance our high quality employee workforce 

we plan to utilize our high quality employee workforce by continuing to leverage our commercial skills in addition we plan to enhance our workforce through selective hiring practices and effective training programs on safety environmental stewardship and other professional and technical skills

we have blended ethanol into gasoline for more than 20 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007 in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline were 74  mbpd in 2013  68  mbpd in 2012  and 70  mbpd in 2011  we sell reformulated gasoline which is also blended with ethanol in parts of our marketing territory including illinois kentucky indiana wisconsin and pennsylvania we also sell biodieselblended diesel fuel in 12 states in our marketing area the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol and biodiesel blending programs will be driven by market economics and government regulations 

we hold interests in ethanol production facilities in albion michigan clymers indiana and greenville ohio these plants have a combined ethanol production capacity of 275  million gallons per year and are managed by a coowner 

propane  we produce propane at most of our refineries propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers 

feedstocks and special products  we are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and specialty products product availability varies by refinery and includes propylene raffinate butane benzene xylene molten sulfur cumene and toluene we market all products domestically to customers in the chemical agricultural and fuelblending industries in addition we produce fuelgrade coke at our garyville detroit and galveston bay refineries which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications and anodegrade coke at our robinson refinery which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry our feedstocks and special products sales increased to 214  mbpd in 2013  from 112  mbpd in 2012  primarily due to our acquisition of the galveston bay refinery

the demand for gasoline is seasonal with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel the following table sets forth speedway merchandise statistics for the past three years 



as of december 31 2013  speedway had 1478  convenience stores in nine  states which includes the 2013 expansion into pennsylvania and tennessee the following table sets forth the number of convenience stores by state owned by our speedway segment as of december 31 2013  



pipeline transportation 

as of december 31 2013  we owned leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8300  miles of crude oil and products pipelines of which approximately 2900  miles are owned through our investments in mplx and pipe line holdings 

mplx 

in 2012 we formed mplx a master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on october 31 2012 mplx completed its initial public offering we own a 736  percent interest in mplx including the two percent general partner interest as of december 31 2013 mplx’s assets consisted of a 56  percent general partner interest in pipe line holdings which owns common carrier pipeline systems through marathon pipe line llc “mpl” and ohio river pipe line llc “orpl” and a 100 percent interest in a one million  barrel butane storage cavern in west virginia in addition we own the remaining 44  percent limited partner interest in pipe line holdings 

on february 27 2014 we announced that an additional 13  percent of pipe line holdings will be sold to mplx effective on march 1 2014 mplx intends to finance the acquisition with cash onhand and by borrowing on its revolving credit agreement this will increase mplxs and reduce our ownership interest in pipe line holdings to 69  percent and 31  percent respectively 

as of december 31 2013  pipe line holdings through mpl and orpl owned or leased and operated 1004  miles of common carrier crude oil lines and 1902  miles of common carrier products lines comprising 30  systems located in nine  states and four  tank farms in illinois and indiana with available storage capacity of 329 million  barrels that is committed to mpc the table below sets forth additional detail regarding the pipeline systems and storage assets we owned through pipe line holdings and mplx as of december 31 2013  



 the pipe line holdings common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the united states based on total volume delivered third parties generated 13  percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on these common carrier pipelines in 2013  excluding volumes shipped by mpc under joint tariffs with third parties these common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years 



 mpcretained assets and investments 

in addition to our ownership interest in pipe line holdings we retained ownership interests in several crude oil and products pipeline systems and pipeline companies mpc consolidated volumes transported through our common carrier pipelines which include mplx and our undivided joint interests are shown in the following table for each of the last three years 



as of december 31 2013  we owned undivided joint interests in the following common carrier crude oil pipeline systems 



as of december 31 2013  we had partial ownership interests in the following pipeline companies 



 we also own 183  miles of private crude oil pipelines and 760  miles of private refined products pipelines that are operated by mpl for the benefit of our refining  marketing segment on a cost recovery basis the following table provides additional information on these assets 



 as of december 31 2013  we owned or leased 60  private tanks with storage capacity of approximately 65 million  barrels which are located along mplx pipelines 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products based upon the “the oil  gas journal 2013  worldwide refinery survey” we ranked fourth among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity as of december 31 2013  we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale spot branded and retail distribution we believe we compete with about 60  companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers about 90  companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market 11  refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded independent entrepreneurs and approximately 260  retailers in the retail sale of refined products in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers we do not produce any of the crude oil we refine 

we also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their independent entrepreneurs and other wellrecognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers often selling gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise at competitive prices nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into the retail transportation fuel business energy analysts international inc estimated such retailers had approximately 13  percent of the us gasoline market in mid 2013  

our pipeline transportation operations are highly regulated which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils west texas intermediate and light louisiana sweet crude oils and other market structure differentials also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

environmental matters 

our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for reviewing our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review discussion or implementation the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant for additional information see item 1a risk factors we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products we produce additionally we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective 

our operations are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these environmental laws and regulations include among others the clean air act with respect to air emissions the clean water act with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with any new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until they are finalized 

for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air water solid waste and remediation see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters and compliance costs 

air 

we are subject to substantial requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations the us environmental protection agency “epa” issued an “endangerment finding” in 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to this endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emissions standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles the endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act and the epa’s socalled “tailoring rule” led to permitting of larger stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions including refineries legal challenges filed against these epa actions were overruled by the dc circuit court of appeals in response several parties sought further review by the us supreme court which heard oral arguments on the challenges in february 2014 with an expected decision by mid2014 the epa has proposed new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions for new electric utilitygenerating units and has announced plans to regulate existing and modified units as well this could impact electric rates for all our operations and could impose new requirements on the combined heat and power unit we operate it is also likely that the epa will propose refineryspecific new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions sometime in the future congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax private parties have sued utilities and other emitters of greenhouse gas emissions but we have not been named in any of those lawsuits privateparty litigation is also pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken although there may be an adverse financial impact associated with any legislation regulation litigation or other action including compliance costs potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for certain refined products made from crude oil the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 

in 2013 the obama administration developed the social cost of carbon “scc the scc is to be used by the epa and other federal agencies in regulatory costbenefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases the scc was first issued in 2010 and in 2013 the obama administration significantly increased the estimate to 36 per ton in response to the regulated community and congress’ critiques in how the scc was developed the office of management and budget recently announced the opportunity to comment on the scc while the impact of a higher scc in future regulations is not known at this time it may result in increased costs to our operations 

the epa has reviewed and has revised or will propose to revise the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for criteria air pollutants the naaqs are subject to multiple court challenges making final compliance plans uncertain the epa promulgated a revised ozone standard in march 2008 and commenced a multiyear process to develop the implementing rules required by the clean air act in 2013 the epa is expected to propose a stricter ozone standard as part of the epa’s periodic review of that standard on july 23 2013 the dc circuit court of appeals issued a decision on the 2008 ozone naaqs lawsuit the court upheld the primary standard but remanded the secondary naaqs standard to the epa on the grounds that the epa had not justified setting the secondary standard at the same level as the primary standard on remand the epa could address the court’s ruling by proposing a separate secondary standard that is more stringent than the primary standard also in 2010 the epa adopted new shortterm standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide and in december 2012 issued a more stringent fine particulate matter pm 25 standard we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these proposed and revised naaqs standards until the standards are finalized individual state implementing rules are established and judicial challenges are resolved 

the epa finalized the boiler and process heater maximum achievable control technology “boiler mact” in march 2011 with work practice standards that are applicable to refinery and natural gas fired equipment subsequently in january 2013 the epa made certain revisions to the march 2011 final rule in response to petitions for reconsideration currently litigation is pending in the dc circuit court on both the 2011 and 2013 rulemakings we anticipate litigation to continue through 2014 final financial impacts of the boiler mact rule cannot be determined at this time because of the ongoing litigation which could affect the final rule 

on july 20 2011 the epa proposed a rule regarding cooling water intake structures which could affect some of our refineries the rule would place new requirements on these structures the epa has requested and received public comments on the rule as proposed including comments on the types of structures covered by the rule until the rule is issued final we will not know whether the rule will apply to refinery intakes and the costs of complying with the rule 

in 2014 the epa is expected to propose a refinery sector rule this rule may require various refinery unit modifications additional controls lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of this rule until it is proposed and finalized 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the clean water act and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other requirements requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances also in case of any such release opa90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages opa90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements 

additionally opa90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be doublehulled and that existing tank vessels that are not doublehulled be retrofitted or removed from us service all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the doublehulled requirements of opa90 we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks “usts” containing regulated substances we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at two of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite thirdparty treatment and disposal facilities ongoing rcrarelated costs however are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain convenience stores and other locations where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

mileage standards renewable fuels and other fuels requirements 

in 2007 the us congress passed the energy independence and security act “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 and contains a second renewable fuel standard “rfs2” in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking new or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations 

the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 1655 billion gallons in 2013 and increases to 360 billion gallons by 2022 in the near term the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline however vehicle regulatory and infrastructure constraints could limit the ability to blend significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline that could be required if the rfs2 standards are not modified the rfs2 has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use within the overall 360 billion gallon rfs2 eisa established an advanced biofuel rfs2 volume of 20 billion gallons in 2012 increasing to 210 billion gallons in 2022 subsets within the advanced biofuel rfs2 include biomassbased diesel which was set at 10 billion gallons in 2012 128 billion gallons in 2013 and at least 10 billion gallons in 2014 through 2022 to be determined by the epa through future rulemaking and cellulosic biofuel which was set at 05 billion gallons in 2012 and 10 billion gallons in 2013 increasing to 160 billion gallons by 2022 in 2013 the epa used its waiver authority under the clean air act to reduce the amount of cellulosic biofuel required under the statute from 10 billion gallons to 6 million gallons currently litigation is ongoing in the dc circuit court of appeals with respect to the epa’s determination of the 2013 cellulosic biofuel requirement subsequently industry has requested the epa to use its waiver authority for 2014 requesting reductions for total renewable fuel advanced biofuels and cellulosic biofuels volumetric obligations 

the epa has issued a proposed rule for 2014 requirements that is in the comment period this proposed rule has substantially reduced the rfs requirements from the statutory numbers as follows total renewables has been reduced from 1815 to 1521 billion gallons the advanced requirement has been reduced from 375 to 220 billion gallons the biomassbased diesel requirement has remained flat from 2013 at 128 billion gallons and the cellulosic requirement has been reduced from 175 billion to 17 million gallons if these proposed requirements become final it will allow the obligated parties to comply in 2014 without needing any substantial volumes of 85 percent ethanolblended or 15 percent ethanolblended gasolines and postpone the issues and concerns of having to blend ethanol past the 10 percent ethanol “blendwall” at least for 2014 the future of the rfs still remains undecided and is in need of legislative rewrite or repeal to provide a stable business platform for the obligated parties 

the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels including biomassbased diesel and cellulosic biofuel with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels additionally the epa did not finalize the 2013 rfs2 renewable fuel obligations until august 2013 therefore it is uncertain how industry will comply with meeting the advanced biofuels obligation until compliance reports are submitted in june 2014 in 2012 and 2013 the epa also discovered that 173 million biodiesel renewable identification numbers “rins” used to meet the annual requirement for that fuel had been fraudulently created and sold to unsuspecting third parties including mpc the epa proposed a rule establishing a quality assurance program for rins purchased to help meet the annual biofuel requirements under the rfs2 program this rule should be finalized in 2014 and is aimed at reducing the risks that rins are fraudulently created or sold we have already instituted internal procedures to help mitigate this risk 

we made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel rfs2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product and by buying needed biodiesel rins in the epacreated biodiesel rins market 

on october 13 2010 the epa issued a partial waiver decision under the clean air act to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10 percent “e10” to 15 percent “e15” for 2007 and newer lightduty motor vehicles on january 21 2011 the epa issued a second waiver for the use of e15 in vehicles model year 20012006 there are numerous issues including state and federal regulatory issues which need to be addressed before e15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines 

there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in eisa and related regulations we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 

on march 29 2013 the epa announced its proposed tier 3 fuel standards the proposed tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million beginning in calendar year 2017 the epa is expected to finalize the tier 3 fuel standards in 2014 until the rule is finalized and we have developed our compliance plan we cannot reasonably estimate our compliance cost 

trademarks patents and licenses 

our marathon trademark is material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations and our speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail marketing operations we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole in general we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of knowhow rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate while others relate to the ownership of our common stock 

our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business 

failure to identify and manage risks inherent to our business could adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruption due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and to unplanned maintenance or events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents severe weather and labor disputes failure to identify and manage these risks could result in explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage property damage legal liability loss of revenue and substantial fines by governmental authorities 

a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products the measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil or crack spread is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins historically refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile our margins and cost of producing gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions any overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins many of the factors influencing a change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control these factors include 

 some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce which may reduce our revenues income from operations and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses we do not insure against all such potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and to unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents or unplanned maintenance severe weather and labor disputes for example pipelines provide a nearlyexclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries in such instances a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

we rely on the performance of our information technology systems the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and network infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include data network and telecommunications internet access and our websites and various computer hardware equipment and software applications including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business these systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters software viruses or other malware power failures cyberattacks and other events we also face various other cybersecurity threats including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans there can be no guarantee such plans to the extent they are in place will be totally effective 

the retail market is diverse and highly competitive and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business 

we face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices several nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business these nontraditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow because of their diversity integration of operations experienced management and greater financial resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market in addition these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts adversely affecting our profit margins additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the development availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of the pipelines railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred 

we have debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

at december 31 2013  our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were 34 billion  we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

 a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money andor limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 38 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our texas city and detroit refineries are scheduled to expire in march 2015 and january 2019 respectively the contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our canton catlettsburg and galveston bay refineries are each scheduled to expire in january 2015 these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us or we may experience work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership mplx which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain levels we could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920 which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by the us citizens among other requirements to establish citizenship corporations that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by us citizens if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although the spinoff occurred in mid 2011 certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil however if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries whether accruing before on or after the spinoff we also agreed to be responsible for and indemnify marathon oil with respect to all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff or certain internal restructuring transactions failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368a and 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation warranty covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement in addition we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified taxrelated liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities at this time we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts the tax liabilities described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our company 

the spinoff could be determined not to qualify as a taxfree transaction and marathon oil and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify marathon oil for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

marathon oil received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spinoff qualifies as taxfree to marathon oil us and marathon oil stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a and related provisions of the code if the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect then marathon oil would not be able to continue to rely on the ruling we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations that were relied on in the private letter ruling to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect if notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling the spinoff were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code marathon oil would be subject to tax as if it had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares 

with respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed on marathon oil in connection with the spinoff and certain related transactions as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences as set forth in the private letter ruling we would be liable to marathon oil under the tax sharing agreement for any such taxes or liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us any of our affiliates or any person that after the spinoff is our affiliate we may be similarly liable if we breach specified representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement if we are required to indemnify marathon oil for taxes incurred as a result of the spinoff or certain related transactions being taxable to marathon oil it would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have potential liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil in connection with the spinoff that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions that were required to affect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves if marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our industry 

changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin laws and regulations relating to the emission or discharge of materials into the environment solid and hazardous waste management pollution prevention greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels as well as those relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security in particular are expected to become more stringent the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we believe the issue of climate change will likely continue to receive scientific and political attention with the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations the us pledge in 2009 as part of the copenhagen accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect and was reaffirmed in the president’s 2013 climate action plan meetings of the united nations climate change conference however have produced no legally binding emission reduction requirements on the us also in 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to the endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles the endangerment finding the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act resulted in permitting of greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources but as a result of the epa’s “tailoring rule” permit applicability was limited to larger sources such as refineries legal challenges were filed against these epa actions the dc circuit court of appeals overruled these challenges in response several parties sought further review by the us supreme court which heard oral argument on the challenges in february 2014 with an expected decision by mid2014 additionally as part of the epa’s ongoing regulatory agenda we anticipate refineryspecific new source performance standards may be proposed in late 2014 

in 2013 the obama administration developed the social cost of carbon scc the scc is to be used by the epa and other federal agencies in regulatory costbenefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases the scc was first issued in 2010 and in 2013 the obama administration significantly increased the estimate to 36 per ton in response to the regulated community and congress’ critiques in how the scc was developed the office of management and budget recently announced the opportunity to comment on the scc while the impact of a higher scc in future regulations is not known at this time it may result in increased costs to our operations 

in the future congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax other measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review or implementation in the us these measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions private party litigation is pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken these actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented although uncertain these developments could increase our costs reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 

the eisa among other things sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the us by model year 2020 and contains a second renewable fuel standard commonly referred to as rfs2 in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking increases in fuel mileage standards and the increased use of renewable fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels may reduce demand for refined products governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could also pose a competitive threat to our operations 

the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 1655 billion gallons in 2013 and increases to 360 billion gallons by 2022 the rfs2 presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use the advanced biofuels program a subset of the rfs2 requirements creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations 

tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may further reduce refined product margins 

on march 29 2013 the epa announced its proposed tier 3 fuel standards the proposed tier 3 fuel standards require among other things a lower allowable sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million by january 1 2017 the epa is expected to finalize this rule in early 2014 our cost of compliance may be material however we will likely not be able to reasonably estimate our compliance costs until we have had time to review the final standards and develop our compliance plans 

we have in the past owned or operated and currently own and operate convenience stores and other locations with usts in various states the operation of usts poses risks including soil and groundwater contamination at our previously or currently operated locations such contamination could result in substantial cleanup costs fines or civil liabilities 

we have in the past and will continue to dispose of various wastes at lawful disposal sites environmental laws including cercla and similar state laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when performed 

any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal penalties injunctions limiting our operations investigatory or remedial liabilities or impediments to construction of additional facilities or equipment 

worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use payroll franchise withholding and property taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties 

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing gross margins 

the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies producing companies and trading companies including suppliers from canada the middle east and various other international locations the market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market we are therefore subject to the attendant political geographic and economic risks of such a market if one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our operations sales of refined products and refining and marketing gross margins could be adversely affected materially and adversely impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

the us government has issued warnings that energy assets in general including the nations refining pipeline and terminal infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations the threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks any future terrorist attacks on our facilities those of our customers and in some cases those of other pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 

 we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock

 item 2 properties 

the location and general character of our refineries convenience stores pipeline systems and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1 business and are incorporated herein by reference the plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency in addition we believe that our properties and facilities are adequate for our operations and that our facilities are adequately maintained as of december 31 2013  we were the lessee under a number of cancellable and noncancellable leases for certain properties including land and building space office equipment storage facilities and transportation equipment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 24  for additional information regarding our leases 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are the subject of or a party to a number of pending or threatened legal actions contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters including laws and regulations relating to the environment some of these matters are discussed below 

litigation 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty while it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

kentucky emergency pricing litigation 

in may 2007 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against us and marathon oil in state court in franklin county kentucky for alleged violations of kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws following hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 the lawsuit alleges that we overcharged customers by 89 million during september and october 2005 the complaint seeks disgorgement of these sums as well as penalties under kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws we are vigorously defending this litigation we believe that this is the first lawsuit for damages and injunctive relief under the kentucky emergency pricing laws to progress this far and it contains many novel issues in may 2011 the kentucky attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in april and may 2011 under statewide price controls that were activated by the kentucky governor on april 26 2011 and which have since expired the court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief and the remainder of the 2011 claims likely will be resolved along with those dating from 2005 if the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably in its entirety it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse effect 

environmental proceedings 

during 2001 we entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act and other violations with the epa covering our refineries the settlement committed us to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to our refineries which are now complete we are working with the epa to terminate the new source review consent decree 

in january 2011 the epa notified us of 18 alleged violations of various statutory and regulatory provisions related to motor fuels some of which we had previously selfreported to the epa no formal enforcement action has been commenced and no demand for penalties has been asserted by the epa in connection with these alleged violations however it is possible that the epa could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with one or more of the alleged violations 

we have been subject to a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency “iepa” and the illinois attorney general’s office since 2002 concerning selfreporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at the robinson illinois refinery it is possible the iepa could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with this matter 

on january 3 2013 the louisiana department of environmental quality “ldeq” issued a consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty alleging violations related to selfreported air emission events occurring at our garyville louisiana refinery between the years of 2005 and 2011 it is possible the ldeq could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with this matter 

in january 2013 the epa provided notice of alleged clean air act violations pertaining to a 2011 audit of our woodhaven michigan facility we have tentatively agreed to pay a penalty of 23200 to the epa and undertake a supplemental safety project of 87000 

in may 2013 the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq issued a notice of enforcement to marathon petroleum company lp for alleged violations associated with exceeding various air permit limits in november 2013 mdeq issued a notice of violation for air permit exceedences that we had selfdisclosed to mdeq in october 2013 we expect to resolve these violations through revisions in the air permit limits we have agreed to pay a penalty of 99500 to mdeq 

we are involved in a number of other environmental enforcement matters arising in the ordinary course of business while the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of each of these other matters is not likely to result in a penalty in excess of 100000 and that collectively the environmental proceedings described above and these other environmental enforcement matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

corporate overview 

we are an independent petroleum refining marketing and transportation company we currently own and operate seven  refineries all located in the united states with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 17  mmbpcd our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas including the midwest gulf coast and southeast regions of the united states we distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and a combination of mpcowned and thirdpartyowned trucking and rail assets as of december 31 2013  we owned leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8300  miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the united states on the basis of total volumes delivered 

our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing speedway and pipeline transportation each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer see item 1 business for additional information on our segments 

 the spinoff and basis of presentation 

on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its rmt business into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil common stock in accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between marathon oil and mpc the distribution of mpc common stock was made on june 30 2011 with marathon oil stockholders receiving one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon oil common stock held following the spinoff marathon oil retained no ownership interest in mpc and each company had separate public ownership boards of directors and management on july 1 2011 our common stock began trading “regularway” on the nyse under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

prior to the spinoff on june 30 2011 our results of operations and cash flows consisted of the rmt business which represented a combined reporting entity subsequent to the spinoff our results of operations and cash flows consist of consolidated mpc activities all significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated the consolidated statements of income for periods prior to the spinoff include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by the marathon oil companies including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight accounting treasury tax legal procurement and information technology those allocations were based primarily on specific identification headcount or computer utilization our management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from the marathon oil companies are reasonable however the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a standalone company during those periods presented prior to the spinoff and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows had we been a standalone company during the periods presented actual 

costs that would have been incurred if we had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure subsequent to the spinoff we are performing these functions using internal resources or services provided by third parties certain of which were provided by the marathon oil companies during a transition period pursuant to a transition services agreement which terminated june 30 2012 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7  

executive summary 

net income attributable to mpc was 211 billion  or 664  per diluted share in 2013  compared to 339 billion  or 989  per diluted share in 2012  the decrease  was primarily due to our refining  marketing segment which generated income from operations of 321 billion  in 2013  compared to 510 billion  in 2012  the decrease  in refining  marketing segment income from operations was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes  

our speedway segment generated income from operations of 375 million  for 2013  compared to 310 million  for 2012  the increase was primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate gross margins and a higher merchandise gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses related to an increase in the number of convenience stores  

during 2013 speedway acquired nine convenience stores located in tennessee western indiana and western pennsylvania which expanded speedways marketing area by two additional states in 2012 speedway acquired 97 convenience stores located in indiana ohio and northern kentucky these acquisitions support our strategic initiative to increase speedway segment sales and complement our existing network of assets 

our pipeline transportation segment generated income from operations of 210 million  for 2013  compared to 216 million  for 2012  the decrease  primarily reflects higher operating expenses and depreciation and lower pipeline affiliate income partially offset by higher transportation revenue the higher expenses and revenues were primarily attributable to the formation of mplx 

on february 1 2013 we acquired from bp the 451000 barrel per calendar day refinery in texas city texas three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery four light product terminals brandedjobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1200 branded sites a 1040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 mbpd allocation of space on the colonial pipeline we refer to these assets as the “galveston bay refinery and related assets” we paid 149 billion for these assets which included 935 million for inventory pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement we may also be required to pay bp a contingent earnout of up to an additional 700 million over six years subject to certain conditions these assets are part of our refining  marketing and pipeline transportation segments our financial results and operating statistics for all periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for the galveston bay refinery and related assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5  for additional information on the acquisition of these assets 

in 2012 we completed a 22 billion excluding capitalized interest heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit refinery this project increased the refinery’s heavy crude oil refining capacity from 20 mbpcd to 100 mbpcd allowing it to process more heavy sour crude oils including canadian bitumen blends which have historically traded at a significant discount to light sweet crude oil we also continued to optimize our refineries in 2013 increasing their combined crude oil refining capacity by 15  mbpcd 

on august 1 2013  we acquired from mitsui  co usa inc its interests in three  ethanol companies for 75 million  under the purchase agreement we acquired an additional 24 percent  interest in tace bringing our ownership interest to 60 percent  a 34 percent  interest in taei which holds a 50 percent  ownership in tame bringing our direct and indirect ownership interest in tame to 67 percent  and a 40 percent  interest in taae which owns an ethanol production facility in albion michigan on october 1 2013 our ownership interest in taae increased to 43 percent  as a result of taae acquiring one of the owners interest we hold a noncontrolling interest in each of these entities and account for them using the equity method of accounting since the minority owners have substantive participating rights 

in 2012 we formed mplx a master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on october 31 2012 mplx completed its initial public offering of 199 million common units which represented the sale by us of a 264 percent interest in mplx we currently own a 736 percent interest in mplx including the two percent general partner interest and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest 

headquartered in findlay ohio mplx’s assets as of december 31 2013  consist of a 56  percent general partner interest in pipe line holdings which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states and a 100 percent interest in a butane storage cavern in west virginia we own the remaining 44  percent limited partner interest in pipe line holdings the financial results and operating statistics in this section include 100 percent of these assets for all time periods presented see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 4  for additional information on mplx 

on february 27 2014 we announced that an additional 13  percent of pipe line holdings will be sold to mplx effective march 1 2014 for 310 million  subsequent to this transaction mplx will own a 69  percent general partner interest in pipe line holdings and we will own a 31  percent limited partner interest mplx intends to finance this transaction with 40 million  of cash onhand and by borrowing 270 million  on its revolving credit agreement 

in 2013 we agreed with enbridge energy partners lp enbridge to serve as an anchor shipper for the sandpiper pipeline which will run from beaver lodge north dakota to superior wisconsin and is targeted to be operational in early 2016 we also agreed to fund 375 percent of the construction of the sandpiper pipeline project which is currently estimated to cost 26 billion of which approximately 10 billion is our share we made initial contributions of 24 million in 2013 in exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in enbridges north dakota system when the sandpiper pipeline is placed into service enbridges north dakota system currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long we will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements 

in 2012 we agreed to be the anchor shipper on enbridge incs proposed southern access extension pipeline which will run from flanagan ill to patoka ill as a result of that commitment we obtained the option to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in the pipeline in conjunction with our commitment to the sandpiper pipeline project our option for equity interest in the southern access extension pipeline increased an additional 10 percent to a total of 35 percent the southern access extension pipeline is expected to be operational in 2015 and we estimate our option for equity interest to cost approximately 250 million 

in 2013 we completed projects to develop infrastructure that facilitates transportation of hydrocarbon liquids production from the utica shale in eastern ohio and western pennsylvania the project with harvest pipeline company increased our truck unloading capacity by 24000 barrels per day and a separate project increased our barge loading capacity to up to 50000 barrels per day at our wellsville ohio terminal 

on february 1 2012 we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan enabling us to purchase up to 20 billion  of mpc common stock over a twoyear period on january 30 2013 we announced that our board of directors approved an additional 20 billion  share repurchase authorization to expire in december 2014  on september 26 2013 we announced that our board of directors approved an additional 20 billion  share repurchase authorization through september 2015  resulting in 60 billion  of total share repurchase authorizations since february 1 2012 we paid 279 billion  in 2013  and 135 billion  in 2012  to repurchase shares as of december 31 2013  we had total outstanding repurchase authorizations of 186 billion  

as of december 31 2013  we had cash and cash equivalents of 229 billion  and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our 25 billion  revolving credit agreement or 13 billion  trade receivables securitization facility or mplx’s 500 million  revolving credit agreement 

the above discussion includes forwardlooking statements that relate to our expectations with respect to the anticipated sale of an additional 13 percent interest in pipe line holdings to mplx the sandpiper pipeline project the southern access extension pipeline project and the share repurchase authorizations factors that could affect the sale of an additional 13 percent interest in pipe line holdings to mplx include but are not limited to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions factors that could affect the sandpiper and southern access extension pipeline projects include but are not limited to availability of materials and labor unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and thirdparty approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include but are not limited to business conditions availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining  marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs 

our refining  marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of purchased products the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants we calculate midwest chicago and us gulf coast “usgc” crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products light louisiana sweet crude oil lls prices and a 6321 ratio of products 6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline 2 barrels of ultralow sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent residual fuel oil are used for these crackspread calculations 

our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil the amount of this discount the sweetsour differential can vary significantly causing our refining  marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil in general a larger sweetsour differential will enhance our refining  marketing gross margin 

historically west texas intermediate crude oil wti has traded at prices similar to lls during 2012 and 2011 wti traded at prices significantly less than lls which favorably impacted our refining  marketing gross margin logistical constraints in the us midcontinent markets and other market factors acted to keep the price of wti from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions however the differential between wti and lls significantly narrowed during 2013 due to a variety of domestic and international market conditions along with changes in logistical infrastructure future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors 

the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions 

  

 in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sweetsour differential and the discount of wti to lls our refining  marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as 

 39 

refining  marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs which include turnaround and major maintenance depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs planned major maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years 



the table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at december 31 of each year 



 speedway 

our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees impacts the speedway segment profitability numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year including local competition seasonal demand fluctuations the available wholesale supply the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions gasoline demand in padd 2 is estimated to have grown by more than one percent in 2013 after coming in flat in 2012 strong economic growth in the second half of 2013 lower prices and a rebound in manufacturing activity supported demand more normal winter temperatures in early 2013 compared to a relatively warm 2012 and a surge in manufacturing contributed to an estimated two percent growth in padd 2 distillate demand market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize the gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to speedways gross margin approximately twothirds of speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2013  speedways convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise including prepared foods beverages and nonfood items 

pipeline transportation 

the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining  marketing segment in 2012 new transportation services agreements were entered into between mpc and mplx which resulted in higher tariff rates the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

results of operations 

years ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012 

consolidated results of operations 



net income attributable to mpc decreased   128 billion  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to a decrease in our refining  marketing segment income from operations of 189 billion  in 2013  compared to 2012  the decrease  in refining  marketing segment income from operations was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes  

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes increased   1792 billion  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to higher  refined product sales volumes which increased  to 2086  mbpd in 2013  from 1618  mbpd in 2012  the higher sales volumes are primarily associated with the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery in february 2013 this impact was partially offset by a decrease  in refined product selling prices 

income from equity method investments increased   10 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in income from our ethanol investments of 34 million partially offset by a decrease in income from our investment in loop llc loop of 17 million the increase in income from ethanol investments was primarily due to lower corn prices in 2013 compared to 2012 and the acquisition of interests in taae tace and taei in 2013 loop experienced lower operating revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 due to changing crude patterns and lower storage revenues 

net gain on disposal of assets decreased   171 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the absence of a 171 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our minnesota assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 6  for additional information on the minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement agreement with the buyer 

other income increased   6 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in sales of rins and dividends received from a pipeline affiliate partially offset by the absence of 12 million of dividends received from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our minnesota assets during the third quarter of 2012 

cost of revenues increased   1873 billion  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in purchased crude oil volumes in the refining  marketing segment crude oil volumes increased   33 percent  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily associated with the galveston bay refinery acquired in february 2013 

purchases from related parties increased   77 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to higher ethanol volumes purchased from our ethanol investments partially offset by lower ethanol prices and decreases in purchases from pipeline affiliates including centennial pipeline llc centennial in 2013  

consumer excise taxes increased   554 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase  in refined product sales volumes related to the galveston bay refinery acquired in february 2013 

depreciation and amortization increased   225 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit michigan refinery in late 2012 and our acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets in february 2013 

other taxes increased   70 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to increases in personal property taxes of 41 million payroll taxes of 21 million and sales and use tax expense of 13 million these increases were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit refinery the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets and speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 

net interest and other financial costs increased   69 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily reflecting a decrease  in capitalized interest in 2013 due to the completion of the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project in late 2012 we capitalized interest of 28 million  in 2013  compared to 101 million  in 2012  

provision for income taxes decreased   732 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the 199 billion   decrease  in income before income taxes in 2013  the effective tax rate of 34 percent  in 2013  is less than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences including the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state and local tax expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12  for further details 

segment results 

revenues are summarized by segment in the following table 



refining  marketing segment revenues increased   1820 billion  in 2013  from 2012  primarily due to an increase  in refined product sales volumes related to the galveston bay refinery acquired in february 2013 partially offset by lower  refined product selling prices the table below shows our refining  marketing segment refined product sales volumes and prices 



 the table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas 



refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment were 929 billion  in 2013  compared to 878 billion  in 2012  with the increase primarily due to higher sales volume partially offset by lower selling prices intersegment refined product sales volumes were 298 billion  gallons in 2013  compared to 273 billion  gallons in 2012  with the increased  volumes primarily due to an increase in speedway’s gasoline and distillate sales volume 

speedway segment revenues increased   232 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to higher  gasoline and distillate sales volumes partially offset by lower  gasoline and distillate selling prices which averaged 345  per gallon in 2013  compared to 354  per gallon in 2012  the speedway segment also had higher  merchandise sales the increases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and merchandise sales primarily resulted from the acquisitions of convenience stores in 2013  and 2012  

pipeline transportation segment revenue increased   78 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped higher crude oil throughput volumes and an increase in storage fees and other revenue 

income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table 

  

 43 

the following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business 



 refining  marketing segment income from operations decreased   189 billion  in 2013  from 2012  primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes  

the sweetsour crude oil differential narrowed  by 394  per barrel and the llswti crude oil differential narrowed  by 819  per barrel in 2013  compared to 2012  which we estimate had negative  impacts on segment income of 121 billion  and 998 million  respectively we estimate the lower net product price realizations had a negative  impact on segment income of 593 million  

total refinery throughputs increased   439  mbpd in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the galveston bay refinery which we acquired on february 1 2013 we estimate higher refinery throughput volumes had a positive  impact of 201 billion  based on the chicago and usgc lls 6321 blended crack spread llswti crude oil differential and sweetsour crude oil differential however we also had higher refinery direct operating costs primarily due to the addition of the galveston bay refinery 

the following table summarizes our refinery throughputs for 2013  and 2012  



 the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the refining  marketing segment for 2013  and 2012  



 44 

refinery direct operating costs increased   111  per barrel of total refinery throughputs in 2013  compared to 2012  which includes an increase  in other manufacturing costs of 099  per barrel the increase in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to the addition of the galveston bay refinery which had higher operating costs per barrel of throughput than the average of our other six refineries 

we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our renewable fuel standard “rfs2” compliance our cost of purchasing rins increased to 264 million  in 2013  from 105 million  in 2012  primarily due to higher ethanol and biomassbased diesel rin prices 

speedway segment income from operations increased   65 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate gross margins and a higher merchandise gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses related to an increase in the number of convenience stores  

the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the speedway segment for 2013  and 2012  



 pipeline transportation segment income from operations decreased   6 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  the decrease  primarily reflects higher operating expenses and depreciation and lower pipeline affiliate income partially offset by higher transportation revenue the higher expenses and revenues were primarily attributable to the formation of mplx 

corporate and other unallocated expenses decreased   65 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  the decrease  was primarily due to lower unallocated employee benefit expenses and lower employee incentive compensation expenses 

we recognized a gain of 183 million in 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our minnesota assets which included 86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 6  for additional information on the minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer 

we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of 95 million  in 2013  and 124 million  in 2012  resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred in 2013  and 2012  respectively 

results of operations 

years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 

consolidated results of operations 



net income attributable to mpc was 100 billion higher in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a higher refining  marketing gross margin which increased to 1785  per barrel in 2012 from 1426  per barrel in 2011 partially offset by higher refinery direct operating costs 

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes increased 365 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increases in refined product selling prices and sales volumes crude oil and refinery feedstock sales volumes and consumer excise taxes 

sales to related parties decreased 47 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease resulted from lower refined product volumes sold to centennial and sales to marathon oil after the spinoff no longer being classified as related party sales 

income from equity method investments decreased 24 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease resulted from an 18 million decrease in income from our ethanol investments and an 8 million decrease in income from our investment in loop our ethanol investments experienced lower product margins in 2012 primarily due to lower demand for corn ethanol and higher corn prices and loop experienced higher expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 

other income decreased 13 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in income from transition services provided to the buyer of our minnesota assets and to marathon oil and a decrease in sales of rins these decreases were partially offset by 12 million of dividend income recognized in 2012 from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our minnesota assets which was paid in connection with our settlement agreement with the buyer see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 6  for additional information on the minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer 

cost of revenues increased 287 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher acquisition costs of crude oil and refined products in the refining  marketing segment which resulted from increased volumes partially offset by decreased prices the increase in crude oil volumes was partially due to purchases from marathon oil not being classified as related party purchases in periods subsequent to the spinoff these impacts were partially offset by decreased acquisition costs of other charge and blendstocks due to decreased volumes and prices crude oil volumes were up 6 percent and refined product volumes were up 8 percent while other charge and blendstocks volumes were down 7 percent crude oil acquisition prices were down 1 percent charge and blendstock prices were down 6 percent and purchased refined product prices were down 4 percent 

purchases from related parties decreased 164 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease was primarily due to purchases of crude oil from marathon oil after the spinoff not being classified as related party transactions 

consumer excise taxes increased 595 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the expiration of a federal excise tax credit for blending ethanol and increased excise tax in select states 

depreciation and amortization increased 104 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit refinery and speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 164 million in 2012 compared to 2011 employee compensation and benefit expenses comprised 141 million of the increase which was primarily due to 117 million of higher pension settlement expenses in 2012 and an increase in the number of administrative employees associated with being a standalone company for a full year in 2012 compared to half of the year in 2011 partially offset by a decrease in pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 22  for additional information on the pension settlements and the pension plan amendment contract service expenses increased 52 million primarily due to higher information technology costs higher refineryrelated contract services and contract services associated with the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets these impacts were partially offset by having no allocations from marathon oil subsequent to the spinoff 

other taxes increased 31 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increases in operating taxes of 11 million personal property taxes of 8 million real estate taxes of 7 million and franchise taxes of 6 million these increases were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit refinery speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores and higher feedstock inventory values 

related party net interest and other financial income decreased 34 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to our shortterm investments in preferred stock of moc portfolio delaware inc “pfd” a subsidiary of marathon oil being redeemed prior to the spinoff the agreement with pfd was terminated on june 30 2011 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 7  for further discussion of the pfd preferred stock 

net interest and other financial costs increased 49 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in interest expense associated with the 30 billion senior notes issued in february 2011 a decrease in foreign currency gains and an increase in bank service and other fees we capitalized thirdparty interest of 101 million in 2012 compared to 104 million in 2011 the capitalized interest was primarily associated with the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project 

provision for income taxes increased 515 million 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the 152 billion increase in income before income taxes the effective income tax rate decreased from 36 percent in 2011 to 35 percent in 2012 the 2012 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a decrease in adverse tax impacts from state legislation and other permanent benefit differences for years 2012 and 2011 adverse tax impacts of state legislation were 9 million and 19 million respectively the provision for income taxes for periods prior to the spinoff has been computed as if we were a standalone company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 12  for further details 

segment results 

revenues are summarized by segment in the following table 



refining  marketing segment revenues increased 333 billion in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increased refined product selling prices and sales volumes the table below shows our refining  marketing segment refined product sales volumes and prices 



 the table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas 



refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment were 878 billion in 2012 compared to 830 billion in 2011 intersegment refined product sales volumes were 273 billion gallons in 2012 compared to 266 billion gallons in 2011 with the increased volumes primarily due to speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 

speedway segment revenues increased 753 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and selling prices which averaged 354 per gallon in 2012 compared to 344 per gallon in 2011 the speedway segment also had higher merchandise sales excluding cigarettes the increases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and merchandise sales were primarily due to the acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 

pipeline transportation segment revenue increased 56 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher transportation tariffs resulting from increased tariff rates in 2012 and the startup of a new crude oil pipeline in 2012 

income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table 

  

 the following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business 



 refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 151 billion in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to a higher refining  marketing gross margin per barrel which averaged 1785  per barrel in 2012 compared to 1426  per barrel in 2011 partially offset by higher refinery direct operating costs associated with higher planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses our realized refining  marketing gross margin for 2012 benefited from increases in the chicago and usgc lls 6321 blended crack spread of 336 per barrel and the sweetsour crude oil differential of 336 per barrel in 2012 and we estimate these had positive impacts on our refining  marketing gross margin of 168 billion and 870 million respectively these favorable impacts on our refining  marketing gross margin for 2012 compared to 2011 were partially offset by higher cost realizations of the actual mix of crude oils we processed compared to market indicators 

the following table summarizes our refinery throughputs for 2012 and 2011 

  

the increase in crude oil throughput in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increased crude oil refining capacities of the garyville and catlettsburg refineries and the impacts of the planned turnarounds in 2012 and 2011 the decrease in other charge and blendstocks throughput in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the planned turnarounds in 2012 and a combination of increased crude oil throughput and feedstock economics at our garyville refinery in 2012 

the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the refining  marketing segment for 2012 and 2011   



 speedway segment income from operations increased 39 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increases in our merchandise gross margin and our gasoline and distillate gross margin partially offset by higher expenses attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores the increase in the merchandise gross margin was primarily due to margin expansion resulting from higher merchandise and food sales along with an increase in the number of convenience stores 

the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the speedway segment for 2012 and 2011 



 pipeline transportation segment income from operations increased 17 million in 2012 from 2011 the increase primarily reflects higher transportation tariffs partially offset by higher mechanical integrity expenses and a reduction in income from loop 

corporate and other unallocated expenses increased 20 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to our administrative units realizing the impact of being a standalone company in 2012 compared to expenses incurred prior to the june 30 2011 spinoff partially offset by lower pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment in the second quarter of 2012 

we recognized a gain of 183 million in 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our minnesota assets which included 86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 6  for additional information on the minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer 

we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of 124 million in 2012 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred in 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 229 billion  at december 31 2013  compared to 486 billion  at december 31 2012  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table 



net cash provided by operating activities decreased   109 billion  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to decrease s in net income of 126 billion  and noncash income adjustments of 453 million  partially offset by favorable  changes in working capital of 626 million  compared to 2012 net cash provided from operating activities increased 118 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increases in net income of 100 billion and noncash income adjustments of 620 million partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of 441 million 

for 2013  changes in working capital were a net 198 million   source  of cash primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventory volumes accounts payable increased   145 billion  from yearend 2012  primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes and current receivables increased   949 million  from yearend 2012  primarily due to higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes both of these increases are associated with the galveston bay refinery acquired in february 2013 changes in inventories were a 305 million  use of cash in 2013  primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes 

changes in working capital were a net 428 million use of cash in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and payable volumes partially offset by a decrease in current receivables resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and receivable volumes changes in working capital were a net 13 million source of cash in 2011 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from increases in crude oil prices and payable volumes partially offset by an increase in current receivables resulting from increases in crude oil prices and receivable volumes and refined product prices 

cash flows from investing activities decreased 130 billion  in 2013  compared to 2012  and decreased 275 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 the investing activity is further discussed below 

the consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash a reconciliation of additions to property plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years 



 capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below 



 the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets comprised 49 percent  of our total capital spending in 2013  the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project which we completed in 2012 comprised 46 percent and 59 percent excluding capitalized interest associated with this project of our refining  marketing segment capital spending in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

cash provided by disposal of assets totaled 16 million  53 million  and 144 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the 53 million of cash from asset disposals in 2012 primarily included proceeds from a settlement agreement with the buyer of our minnesota assets the 144 million of cash from asset disposals in 2011 primarily included the collection of a receivable associated with the sale of the minnesota assets 

net investments in related party debt securities was a source of cash of 240 billion in 2011 all such activity reflected the net cash flow from redemptions and purchases of pfd preferred stock prior to the spinoff all investments in pfd preferred stock were redeemed and the agreement with pfd was terminated see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 7  for further discussion of our investments in pfd preferred stock 

net investments were a 74 million   use  of cash in 2013  compared to a 51 million   source  of cash in 2012  the change was primarily due to investments in ethanol affiliates of 75 million  and the sandpiper pipeline project of 24 million in 2013 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 322 billion  in 2013  126 billion  in 2012  and 164 billion  in 2011  the net use of cash in 2013 and 2012 was primarily due to the common stock repurchases through open market purchases and our asr programs and dividend payments partially offset in 2012 by proceeds from the issuance of mplx common units the use of cash in 2011 was primarily due to the net repayment of debt payable to marathon oil and its subsidiaries and net distributions to marathon oil partially offset by cash provided from the issuance of longterm debt these 2011 activities were undertaken to effect the spinoff the year 2011 also included a use of cash of 60 million for debt issuance costs associated with our senior notes revolving credit agreement and trade receivables securitization facility see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 19  for additional information on our longterm debt 

cash used in common stock repurchases totaled 279 billion  in 2013  and 135 billion  in 2012  associated with the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors in 2013  we repurchased 36 million  common shares through open market repurchases in 2012 we entered into an 850 million asr program on february 3 2012 under which we repurchased 20 million shares and a 500 million asr program on november 5 2012 under which we received eight million shares in 2012 and one million shares in 2013 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 9  for further discussion of the share repurchase plans 

cash used in dividend payments totaled 484 million  in 2013  407 million  in 2012  and 160 million  in 2011  the increases in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to having a full year of dividend payments in those years compared to 2011 and increases in our base dividend dividends per share were 154  in 2013  120  in 2012  and 045  in 2011 these impacts were partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of share repurchases in 2013 and 2012 

cash proceeds from the issuance of mplx common units was 407 million in 2012 of which 203 million was distributed by mplx to mpc in partial consideration of assets we contributed to mplx and to reimburse us for certain capital expenditures incurred with respect to those assets the initial public offering represented the sale of a 264 percent interest in mplx see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4  for further discussion of mplx 

net borrowings and repayments under our longterm debt payable to marathon oil and its subsidiaries was a use of cash of 362 billion in 2011 the agreements with marathon oil and its subsidiaries were terminated in 2011 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 7  for further discussion of these financing agreements 

net distributions to marathon oil totaled 783 million in 2011 the net distribution in 2011 was primarily related to 147 billion in net cash distributions paid to marathon oil partially offset by income taxes it incurred on our behalf

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk 

capital resources 

as of december 31 2013  we had no  borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreements or our trade receivables securitization facility and our liquidity totaled 609 billion  consisting of 

  

 because of the alternatives available to us including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm and longterm funding requirements including capital spending programs the repurchase of shares of our common stock dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies 

we have a 25 billion  unsecured revolving credit agreement credit agreement in place with a maturity date of september 14 2017 the credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to 20 billion  and swingline loan capacity of up to 100 million  we may increase our borrowing capacity under the credit agreement by up to an additional 500 million  subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased in addition the maturity date may be extended for up to two  additional one year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent  of the commitments then outstanding provided that the commitments of any nonconsenting lenders will be terminated on the theneffective maturity date 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either the adjusted libo rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin or the alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin we are charged various fees and expenses in connection with the credit agreement including administrative agent fees commitment fees on the unused portion of our borrowing capacity and fees related to issued and outstanding letters of credit the applicable interest rates and certain of the fees fluctuate based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time on our longterm debt 

the credit agreement contains certain representations and warranties affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for arrangements of this type including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated net debt as defined in the credit agreement to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no greater than 065  to 100 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 016  to 100 other covenants among other things restrict our ability to incur debt create liens on our assets or enter into transactions with affiliates we were also in compliance with these other covenants contained in the credit agreement 

mplx operations llc an affiliate of mpc and whollyowned subsidiary of mplx lp has a 500 million  unsecured revolving credit agreement mplx credit agreement in place with a maturity date of october 31 2017 the mplx credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to 250 million  and swingline loan capacity of up to 50 million  the borrowing capacity under the mplx credit agreement may be increased by up to an additional 300 million  subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would increase in addition the maturity date may be extended up to two  additional one year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent  of the commitments then outstanding provided that the commitments of any nonconsenting lenders will be terminated on the theneffective maturity date

the mplx credit agreement includes certain representations and warranties affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type including a financial covenant that requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 50  to 10 or 55  to 10 during the sixmonth period following certain acquisitions as of december 31 2013  mplx was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 01  to 10 other covenants restrict mplx from incurring debt creating liens on its assets and entering into transactions with affiliates mplx was also in compliance with these other covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement 

on december 18 2013  we entered into a three year 13 billion  trade receivables securitization facility with a group of financial institutions that act as committed purchasers conduit purchasers letter of credit issuers and managing agents under the facility the facility is evidenced by a receivables purchase agreement and a second amended and restated receivables sale agreement and replaces the previously existing accounts receivable facility that was set to expire on june 30 2014  

the facility consists of one of our whollyowned subsidiaries marathon petroleum company lp “mpc lp” selling or contributing on an ongoing basis all of its trade receivables including trade receivables acquired from marathon petroleum trading canada llc a whollyowned subsidiary of mpc lp together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof without recourse to another whollyowned bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary mpc trade receivables company llc “trc” in exchange for a combination of cash equity or a subordinated note issued by trc to mpc lp trc in turn has the ability to finance its purchase of the receivables from mpc lp by selling undivided ownership interests in qualifying trade receivables together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof without recourse to the purchasing group in exchange for cash proceeds the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to an initial amount of 125 billion  provided that the aggregate credit exposure of the purchasing group is limited to no more than 13 billion  at any one time 

to the extent that trc retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased or received from mpc lp such interest will be included in our consolidated financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of trc with those of mpc the receivables sold or contributed to trc are available first and foremost to satisfy claims of the creditors of trc and are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of mpc trc has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the purchasing group to secure its obligations under the receivables purchase agreement 

proceeds from the sale of undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying receivables under the facility will be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheet none of which was outstanding as of december 31 2013  we will remain responsible for servicing the receivables sold to the purchasing group trc pays floatingrate interest charges and usage fees on amounts outstanding under the facility if any and certain other fees related to the administration of the facility and letters of credit that are issued and outstanding under the facility 

the receivables purchase agreement and second amended and restated receivables sale agreement include representations and covenants that we consider usual and customary for arrangements of this type trade receivables are subject to customary criteria limits and reserves before being deemed to qualify for sale by trc pursuant to the facility in addition further purchases of qualified trade receivables under the facility are subject to termination and trc may be subject to default fees upon the occurrence of certain amortization events that are included in the receivables purchase agreement which we consider to be usual and customary for arrangements of this type 

our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile as of december 31 2013  the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows 

  

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

neither the credit agreement the mplx credit agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under the credit agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could under certain circumstances decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post a letter of credit under an existing transportation services agreement 

debttototalcapital ratio 

our debttototal capital ratio total debt to total debtplusequity was 23  percent and 22  percent at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 



capital requirements 

we have a capital and investment budget for 2014  of 243 billion  excluding capitalized interest additional details related to the 2014  capital and investment budget are discussed in the capital budget outlook section below 

on february 1 2013 we acquired the galveston bay refinery and related assets pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement we may be required to pay bp a contingent earnout of up to an additional 700 million over six years subject to certain conditions 

we made contributions to our funded pension plans in late 2013 therefore we do not anticipate any additional contributions will be made in 2014 

on january 25 2014  our board of directors approved a 42 cents  per share dividend payable march 10 2014  to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 19 2014  

at the beginning of 2013 we had total outstanding repurchase authorizations of 650 million on january 30 2013 we announced that our board of directors approved an additional 20 billion share repurchase authorization through december 2014 on september 26 2013 we announced that our board of directors approved an additional 20 billion  share repurchase authorization through september 2015  during 2013  the final shares from the 500 million asr program initiated in 2012 were delivered to us and we paid 279 billion  to acquire 36 million  common shares through open market share repurchases in addition at december 31 2013  we had agreements to acquire additional common shares for 12 million  which were settled in early january 2014 as of december 31 2013  we had total outstanding repurchase authorizations of 186 billion  which expire in september 2015 

we may utilize various methods to effect additional repurchases which could include open market purchases negotiated block transactions asrs or open market solicitations for shares some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing and amount of future repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time 

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to share repurchase authorizations factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include but are not limited to business conditions availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

contractual cash obligations 

the table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31 2013  the contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to mplx under various feebased commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity capital resources and results of operations even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the offbalance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources 

we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil these arrangements are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 25  

capital budget outlook 

we have a capital and investment budget for 2014  of 243 billion  excluding capitalized interest this represents a 12  percent decrease  from our 2013  spending which is primarily due to the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets in 2013 partially offset by an expected increase in the pipeline transportation segment capital spending the budget includes spending on refining retail marketing transportation logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

refining  marketing 

the refining  marketing segments 2014  capital budget is 121 billion  which includes 348 million  for midstream assets the focus of our spending in the refining  marketing segment is on processing more condensate and light crude oil growing distillate production and increasing export volumes a number of these projects span multiple years 

we have approximately 345 million of capital projects that will allow us to process and handle condensate and light crude oil from the utica shale region of which approximately 225 million has been budgeted for 2014  we have projects to invest in condensate splitters at our canton and catlettsburg refineries to allow the refineries to process up to 60  mbpcd of condensate from the utica shale region and to increase the light crude oil processing capacity at our robinson refinery by 30  mbpcd which will allow it to run 100 percent light crude oil these projects are expected to be complete in 2014 for our canton refinery 2015 for our catlettsburg refinery and 2016 for our robinson refinery in addition we completed a trucktobarge crude system project at our wellsville terminal and are continuing to purchase new barges to allow utica production to be transported from our wellsville terminal to our catlettsburg refinery 

we have approximately 315 million of capital projects that will allow us to increase our diesel production of which approximately 90 million has been budgeted for 2014  at our garyville refinery we completed a project in 2013 to modify one of the crude units to improve distillate recovery we completed a hydrocracker expansion in the first quarter of 2014 that increased the hydrocracker capacity to 110 mbpcd and we expect to complete a project to expand the distillate hydrotreater by 10 mbpcd in the first quarter of 2015 at our galveston bay refinery we have a hydrocracker project designed to increase our ulsd production by 9 mbpd by shifting yields from gasoline which we expect to complete in 2015 at our robinson refinery we have a similar project to revamp our distillate hydrocracker to improve margins by processing more feedstock at a lower conversion and shifting approximately 5 mbpd of light products to ulsd production the project is expected to be completed in 2015 

we budgeted 90 million in 2014 and 40 million in 2015 for a frontend engineering and design study for a residual fuel hydrocracker project at our garyville refinery to increase margins by upgrading residual fuel to ulsd and gas oil it would use hydrogen produced from lowcost natural gas to increase the liquid volume by approximately ten percent if we proceed with the project we expect that it will increase garyvilles ulsd production by 28 mbpd and reduce gas oil purchases by 30 mbpd if we proceed with this project we expect to invest 22 billion to 25 billion and anticipate completion in 2018 

we are also evaluating three potential projects for our galveston bay refinery the first project is to increase its hydrotreating capacity that will enable it to produce 100 percent ulsd the second project is to build a gas oil hydrocracker and shut down one of the smaller catalytic cracking units in order to shift production from gasoline to ulsd the third is to revamp the existing crude units for improved fractionation and enhanced distillate recovery 

the remaining budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements at our refineries 

speedway 

the speedway segments 2014  capital budget is 327 million  primarily for new convenience store construction and land acquisitions to expand our markets and remodeling and rebuilding projects to upgrade and enhance our existing facilities we have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores and store rebuilds in our existing markets in addition we are actively acquiring real estate in western pennsylvania and tennessee to be in a position to accelerate the pace of growth in these new contiguous markets over the next several years also included in the capital budget are expenditures for technology equipment and dispenser upgrades 

pipeline transportation 

the pipeline transportation segments 2014  capital budget is 760 million  primarily for equity investments in major pipeline projects new infrastructure and upgrades to replace or enhance our existing facilities 

we agreed to fund 375 percent of the construction of the sandpiper pipeline project and serve as an anchor shipper in exchange for an approximate 27 percent equity interest in enbridges north dakota system when the sandpiper pipeline is placed into service which is targeted for early 2016 the project is estimated to cost 26 billion of which approximately 10 billion is our share we will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements in addition we agreed to be the anchor shipper on enbridge incs proposed southern access extension pipeline in exchange for the option to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in the pipeline the project is expected to be operational in 2015 as a result of our commitment to the sandpiper pipeline project our option for equity interest in the southern access extension pipeline increased an additional 10 percent to a total of 35 percent we budgeted approximately 460 million in 2014  and 145 billion in total for these equity interests 

in addition mplx is planning to construct a 140 million pipeline to connect utica shale production in southeastern ohio to our canton refinery the project is called the cornerstone pipeline and it is anticipated to be operational in 2016 

corporate and other 

the remaining 2014  capital budget includes 133 million  primarily related to an expansion project for our corporate headquarters and upgrades to information technology systems in addition we project 38 million  of capitalized interest associated with various capital projects 

our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forwardlooking statements are based on currently available information if this information proves to be inaccurate future availability of financing may be adversely affected factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided by operating activities the state of worldwide debt and equity markets investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance the global financial climate and in particular with respect to borrowings the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies the discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forwardlooking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending costs for projects under construction project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth upgrades and expansion the forwardlooking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance actual results may differ materially from these expectations estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products actions of competitors delays in obtaining necessary thirdparty approvals changes in labor materials and equipment costs and availability planned and unplanned outages the delay of cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects project cost overruns disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response and other operating and economic considerations 

transactions with related parties 

following completion of the spinoff on june 30 2011 marathon oil retained no ownership interest in us and is no longer a related party 

for the period prior to the spinoff purchases of crude oil and natural gas from marathon oil accounted for five percent of our total cost of revenues and purchases from related parties related party purchases of crude oil and natural gas from marathon oil were at marketbased contract prices the crude oil prices were based on indices that represented market value for time and place of delivery and that were also used in thirdparty contracts the natural gas prices equaled the price at which marathon oil purchased the natural gas from third parties plus the cost of transportation 

we believe that transactions with related parties other than certain transactions with marathon oil to effect the spinoff and related to the provision of administrative services were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties 

on may 25 2011 we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with marathon oil to effect the spinoff and to provide a framework for our relationship with marathon oil because the terms of our separation from marathon oil and these agreements were entered into in the context of a relatedparty transaction the terms may not be comparable to terms that would be obtained in a transaction between unaffiliated parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 7 for further discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers for additional information see item 1a risk factors 

our environmental expenditures including nonregulatory expenditures for each of the last three years were 



 we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation or regulations it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for two  percent eight  percent and 13  percent of capital expenditures in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 126 million  or five  percent of total capital expenditures in 2014  predictions beyond 2014  can only be broadbased estimates which have varied and will continue to vary due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies among other matters based on currently identified projects we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately 391 million  in 2015  however actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 

for more information on environmental regulations that impact us or could impact us see item 1 business—environmental matters item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

 valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 17  for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include

impairment assessments of longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions significant assumptions include 

 we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a poor outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes significant reduction in refining margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets site level for speedway segment convenience stores or the pipeline system level for pipeline transportation segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value 

unlike longlived assets goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at december 31 2013  we had a total of 938 million  of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value appreciably for each of our reporting units in 2013  

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value at december 31 2013  we had 463 million  of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2013 at december 31 2013  centennial was not shipping product as a result we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in centennial we concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of centennial’s assets if current business conditions remain unchanged and the owners of centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets there could be a future impairment of our centennial interest as of december 31 2013  our equity investment in centennial was 29 million  and we had a 42 million  guarantee associated with 50 percent of centennials outstanding debt see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 25  for additional information on the debt guarantee 

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to the carrying value of our centennial equity investment factors that could affect the carrying value of our centennial equity investment include but are not limited to a change in business conditions a further decline or improvement in the longterm outlook of the potential uses of centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

acquisitions 

in accounting for business combinations acquired assets and liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired if any is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain respectively a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property plant and equipment intangible assets contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and for certain acquisitions engage thirdparty consultants for assistance 

the fair value of assets and liabilities including contingent consideration as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches including the income approach which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate the cost approach which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entityspecific differences the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain accordingly actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 

the fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to bp is remeasured each quarter using an income approach with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues the amount of cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a marketbased crack spread and refinery throughput volumes for the months during which the contract applies as well as established thresholds that cap the annual and total payment we used internal and external forecasts for the crack spread and internal forecasts for refinery throughput volumes and applied an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate to the range of cash flows indicated by various scenarios to determine the fair value of the arrangement see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 5  for additional information on our acquisitions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 17  for additional information on fair value measurements 

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 17  additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 

 we utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuary’s discount rate model this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 430 percent for our pension plans and 495 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 39 million and 25 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 3 million and 3 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 62 percent equity securities and 38 percent fixed income securities for the funded pension plans past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness after evaluating activity in the capital markets along with the current and projected plan investments we reduced the asset rate of return from 750 percent to 700 percent effective for 2014 we used the 750 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2013 defined benefit pension expense decreasing the 700 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 4 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 22  includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

contingent liabilities 

we accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions claims litigation environmental remediation tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and thirdparty indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable we regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons for instance settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes which are recorded as other taxes for additional information on contingent liabilities see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters and compliance costs 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss

there are no accounting standards that have not yet been adopted as of december 31 2013  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2013  we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes 17  and 18  for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures and options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also authorize the use of the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below lastin firstout inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts for crude oil refined products and ethanol 

we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the table below sets forth information relating to our significant open commodity derivative contracts as of december 31 2013  

  



a   100 percent  of these contracts expire in the first quarter of 2014 

b  chicago mercantile exchange “cme” 

c  intercontinental exchange “ice” 

d  reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending “rbob” 

sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent  and 25 percent  increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2013  is provided in the following table 



we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2013  would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations related to our debt obligations at december 31 2013  our debt was primarily comprised of the 30 billion  fixed rate senior notes issued on february 1 2011 

sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint shift in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of december 31 2013  is provided in the following table 

  



 at december 31 2013  our portfolio of longterm debt was substantially comprised of fixedrate instruments therefore the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixedrate debt at prices above carrying value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2013  

counterparty risk 

we are also exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties or futures commission merchants we regularly review the creditworthiness of counterparties and futures commission merchants and enter into master netting agreements when appropriate 

forwardlooking statements 

these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forwardlooking statements with respect to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil other refinery feedstocks refined products and ethanol if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements

 item 1 business 

overview 

marathon petroleum corporation “mpc” was incorporated in delaware on november 9 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of marathon oil corporation “marathon oil” on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its refining marketing  transportation business “rmt business” into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil common stock in accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between marathon oil and mpc the distribution of mpc common stock was made on june 30 2011 with marathon oil stockholders receiving one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon oil common stock held the “spinoff” following the spinoff marathon oil retained no ownership interest in mpc and each company had separate public ownership boards of directors and management all subsidiaries and equity method investments not contributed by marathon oil to mpc remained with marathon oil and together with marathon oil are referred to as the “marathon oil companies” on july 1 2011 our common stock began trading “regularway” on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

we are one of the largest independent petroleum product refiners marketers and transporters in the united states our operations consist of three business segments 

 

  

  

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11 for operating segment and geographic financial information which is incorporated herein by reference 

on february 1 2013 we acquired from bp products north america inc and bp pipelines north america inc collectively “bp” the 451000 barrel per calendar day refinery in texas city texas three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery an allocation of bp’s colonial pipeline company shipper history four light product terminals brandedjobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1200 branded sites and a 1040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility we refer to these assets as the “galveston bay refinery and related assets” the operating statistics included in this section do not include these assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 26 for additional information on the acquisition of these assets 

in 2012 we formed mplx lp “mplx” a master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on october 31 2012 mplx completed its initial public offering of 19895000 common units which represented the sale by us of a 264 percent interest in mplx we own a 736 

  

percent interest in mplx including the general partner interest and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest headquartered in findlay ohio mplx’s initial assets consist of a 51 percent general partner interest in mplx pipe line holdings lp “pipe line holdings” which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states and a 100 percent interest in a butane storage cavern in west virginia we own the remaining 49 percent limited partner interest in pipe line holdings the operating statistics in this section include 100 percent of these assets for all time periods presented see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 4 for additional information on mplx’s initial public offering 

on december 1 2010 we completed the sale of most of our minnesota assets these assets included the 74000 barrel per calendar day st paul park refinery and associated terminals 166 convenience stores primarily branded superamerica ® including six stores in wisconsin along with the supermom’s ® bakery a baked goods and sandwich supply operation and certain associated trademarks superamerica franchising llc interests in pipeline assets in minnesota and associated inventories we refer to these assets as the “minnesota assets” the operating statistics included in this section reflect the exclusion of these assets except as otherwise indicated see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7 for additional information on the disposition of these assets 

our competitive strengths 

high quality asset base 

we believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the midwest and the fourth largest in the united states based on crude oil refining capacity we own a sevenplant refinery network including our recently acquired galveston bay refinery with approximately 17 million barrels per calendar day “mmbpcd” of crude oil throughput capacity our refineries process a wide range of crude oils including heavy and sour crude oils which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates specialty chemicals and other refined products 

  

strategic location 

the geographic locations of our refineries and our extensive midstream distribution system provide us with strategic advantages located in petroleum administration for defense district “padd” ii and padd iii which consist of states in the midwest and the gulf coast regions of the united states our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources including domestic canadian and other foreign sources which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs for example geographic proximity to canadian crude oil supply sources allows our midwest refineries to incur lower transportation costs than competitors transporting canadian crude oil to the gulf coast for refining our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access export markets and to serve a broad range of key enduser markets across the united states quickly and costeffectively 

 

 

 attractive growth opportunities through internal projects 

we believe we have attractive growth opportunities through internal capital projects in 2012 we completed a 22 billion excluding capitalized interest heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit michigan refinery the project enables the refinery to process additional heavy sour crude oils including canadian bitumen blends which have traded at a significant discount to light sweet crude oil and increased the refinery’s total crude oil refining capacity by approximately 14 thousand barrels per calendar day “mbpcd” to 120 mbpcd 

  

we plan to evaluate projects that will extract additional value from this major investment at detroit at our garyville louisiana refinery we have initiated projects that we expect will increase our ultralowsulfur diesel “ulsd” production and expand our gasoline and distillates export capabilities we also have projects underway at our robinson illinois refinery to increase distillate yields and at our catlettsburg kentucky refinery to improve gas oil recovery and reduce purchased feedstock volumes thus reducing our feedstock costs we are also increasing our capacity to process condensate from the utica shale region at our canton ohio and catlettsburg refineries 

acquisition of galveston bay refinery and related assets 

through our february 1 2013 acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets we added 451 mbpcd of crude oil refining capacity and have diversified and further balanced our network of refining assets our refining capacity is now balanced between three market areas with 646 mbpcd of capacity in the midwest 531 mbpcd in texas and 522 mbpcd in louisiana this acquisition provides us with the opportunity to capture synergies across our existing gulf coast operations increases our refining capacity for specialty chemicals and is anticipated to enhance our ability to sell refined products into export markets 

extensive midstream distribution networks 

we believe the relative scale of our transportation and distribution assets and operations distinguishes us from other refining and marketing companies we currently own lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8300 miles of crude oil and products pipelines including the approximate 100 miles of natural gas liquid pipelines recently acquired with the galveston bay refinery and related assets through our ownership interests in mplx and pipe line holdings we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the united states on the basis of total volume delivered we also own one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the united states as well as trucking and rail assets we operate this system in coordination with our refining and marketing network which enables us to optimize feedstock and raw material supplies and refined product distribution and further allows for important economies of scale across our system 

general partner and sponsor of mplx 

our investment in mplx provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets mplx’s strong liquidity and borrowing capacity provides us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream logistics business our role as the general partner allows us to maintain strategic control of the assets so we can continue to optimize our refinery feedstock and distribution networks 

competitively positioned marketing operations 

we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area we have two strong retail brands speedway ® and marathon ®  we believe our 1464 speedway ® convenience stores which we operate through a wholly owned subsidiary speedway llc comprise the fourth largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states and was available through approximately 5000 retail outlets operated by jobbers and dealers in 17 states as of december 31 2012 in addition as part of the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets we were assigned retail marketing contracts for approximately 1200 branded retail outlets that we are in the process of converting to the marathon brand we believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost 

  

established track record of profitability and diversified income stream 

we have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the refining cycle we believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results as shown in the following chart income from operations attributable to the speedway and pipeline transportation segments is less sensitive to business cycles while our refining  marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable 

marathon petroleum corporation 

segment income from operations 

 

strong financial position 

as of december 31 2012 we had 486 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 30 billion in unused committed credit facilities excluding mplx’s credit facility we also had 336 billion of debt at yearend which represented only 22 percent of our total capitalization this combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage allows us to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies 

our business strategies 

achieve toptier safety and environmental performance 

we remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations we have a history of safe and reliable operations which was demonstrated with record employee and contractor safety performance across all our operations in 2012 including a world class safety record for the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit refinery in addition we remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations while proactively meeting our regulatory requirements 

grow enterprise value 

we intend to grow our share price through a combination of earnings growth and return of capital to shareholders in the form of strong and growing dividends and sustained share repurchases we have increased our quarterly dividend by 75 percent since becoming a standalone company in june 2011 and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling 40 billion we entered into two accelerated share repurchase “asr” programs for a total of 135 billion through which we repurchased approximately 8 percent of our outstanding common shares in 2012 after the effects of these asr programs 265 billion of the 40 billion total authorization is available for future repurchases 

  

expand midstream business through mplx 

we expect there will be significant investment in infrastructure to connect growing north american crude oil production with existing refining assets and to move refined products to wholesale and retail marketing customers we intend to aggressively participate in this infrastructure build out and mplx will be the entity through which we expect to grow our midstream business we intend to increase revenue on the mplx network of pipeline systems through higher utilization of existing assets by capitalizing on organic investment opportunities that may arise from the growth of mpc’s operations and from increased thirdparty activity in mplx’s areas of operations through mplx we also plan to pursue acquisitions of midstream assets both within our existing geographic footprint and in new areas 

deliver top quartile refining performance 

our refineries are well positioned to benefit from the growing crude oil and condensate production in north america including the bakken eagle ford and utica shale regions along with the canadian oil sands we are also well positioned to export distillates and other products as the demand continues to grow 

we intend to increase our earnings in the refining  marketing segment through organic investments and selective acquisitions while maintaining financial discipline for example we recently completed a 22 billion investment excluding capitalized interest to upgrade and expand our detroit refinery this investment significantly expands our ability to process heavy crude oil at the detroit refinery from about 20 mbpcd to 100 mbpcd in february 2013 we closed on the 451 mbpcd galveston bay refinery this acquisition increases our crude oil refining capacity by approximately 36 percent diversifies the footprint of our refining assets provides us with the opportunity to increase our export sales and significantly increases our participation in the chemicals value chain we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our existing asset base with an emphasis on increasing distillates production and export capabilities 

increase assured sales volumes at our marathon brand and speedway locations 

we consider assured sales as those sales we make to marathon brand customers our speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts we believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations between our refineries our pipelines and our terminals the marathon brand has been a consistent vehicle for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets provides us with opportunities to further expand our market presence through the assignment of brandedjobber contracts representing approximately 1200 retail outlets we are in position to take advantage of opportunities with premier southeast jobbers and to significantly expand our brand presence in the southeast we also intend to grow speedway gasoline and distillates sales volumes through internal capital program growth projects and acquisitions that complement our existing store network 

deliver profitable speedway growth 

we intend to grow speedway’s sales and profitability by focusing on continuous improvement of existing operations organic growth and strategic store acquisition opportunities for example the acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 has increased speedway’s presence in the midwest in addition our industryleading speedy rewards ® customer loyalty program which has over three million members provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our speedway customer base with existing and new speedway locations 

utilize and expand our high quality employee workforce 

we plan to utilize our high quality employee workforce by continuing to leverage our commercial skills in addition we plan to expand our workforce through selective hiring practices and effective training programs on safety environmental stewardship and other professional and technical skills 

  

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to our competitive strengths and business strategies including our share repurchase program and pursuing potential acquisitions there can be no assurance that we will be successful in whole or in part in pursuing our business strategies including our share repurchase program or pursuing potential acquisitions factors that could affect the share repurchase program and its timing include but are not limited to business conditions availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock factors that could affect pursuing potential acquisitions include but are not limited to our ability to implement and realize the benefits and synergies of our strategic initiatives availability of liquidity actions taken by competitors regulatory approvals and operating performance these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements for additional information on forwardlooking statements and risks that can affect our business see “disclosures regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

refining  marketing 

refineries 

as of december 31 2012 we owned and operated six refineries in the gulf coast and midwest regions of the united states with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 125 mmbpcd the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery on february 1 2013 increased our crude oil refining capacity to approximately 17 mmbpcd during 2012 our refineries processed 1195 thousand barrels per day “mbpd” of crude oil and 168 mbpd of other charge and blendstocks during 2011 our refineries processed 1177 mbpd of crude oil and 181 mbpd of other charge and blendstocks the table below sets forth the location crude oil refining capacity tank storage capacity and number of tanks for each of our refineries as of december 31 2012 

 

  

 our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation fluid catalytic cracking catalytic reforming desulfurization and sulfur recovery units the refineries process a wide variety of crude oils and produce numerous refined products ranging from transportation fuels such as reformulated gasolines blendgrade gasolines intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ulsd fuel to heavy fuel oil and asphalt additionally we manufacture aromatics propane propylene cumene and sulfur our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations produce higher margin products and utilize our processing capacity efficiently for example naphtha may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available also by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work 

  

garyville louisiana refinery  our garyville louisiana refinery is located along the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana between new orleans and baton rouge the garyville refinery is configured to process almost any grade of crude oil into products such as gasoline distillates fuelgrade coke asphalt polymer grade propylene propane slurry isobutane and sulfur an expansion project was completed in 2009 that increased garyville’s crude oil refining capacity making it one of the largest refineries in the us our garyville refinery has earned designation as a us occupational safety and health administration “osha” voluntary protection program “vpp” star site 

catlettsburg kentucky refinery  our catlettsburg kentucky refinery is located in northeastern kentucky on the western bank of the big sandy river near the confluence with the ohio river the catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline distillates asphalt heavy fuel oil cumene propane propylene and petrochemicals

we obtain the crude oil we refine through negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market our crude oil supply contracts are generally term contracts with marketrelated pricing provisions the following table provides information on our sources of crude oil for each of the last three years including the st paul park refinery until december 1 2010 the crude oil sourced outside of north america was acquired from various foreign national oil companies production companies and trading companies 

 

 our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks and distribute our refined products through a variety of channels including pipelines trucks railcars ships and barges during 2012 we began transporting crude oil by truck from the utica shale region to our canton refinery as of december 31 2012 we owned four transport trucks and seven trailers for this purpose 

refined product marketing 

we believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our 17state market area in the midwest gulf coast and southeast regions of the united states independent retailers wholesale customers our marathon brand jobbers and speedway brand convenience stores airlines transportation companies and utilities comprise the core of our customer base in addition we sell distillates asphalt and gasoline for export to international customers primarily out of our garyville refinery sales destined for export comprised approximately 25 percent of our distillate sales and 13 percent of our asphalt sales in 2012

 gasoline and distillates  we sell gasoline gasoline blendstocks and distillates including no 1 and no 2 fuel oils kerosene jet fuel and diesel fuel to wholesale customers marathonbranded jobbers and dealers and our 

  

speedway ® convenience stores in the midwest gulf coast and southeast regions of the united states and on the spot market in addition we sell diesel fuel for export to international customers we sold 57 percent of our gasoline sales volumes and 89 percent of our distillates sales volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2012 the demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months 

we have blended ethanol into gasoline for more than 20 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007 in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline including the minnesota assets until december 1 2010 were 68 mbpd in 2012 70 mbpd in 2011 and 68 mbpd in 2010 the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations we sell reformulated gasoline which is also blended with ethanol in parts of our marketing territory including kentucky illinois indiana wisconsin pennsylvania and texas we also sell biodieselblended diesel fuel in kentucky west virginia illinois ohio north carolina florida virginia pennsylvania georgia minnesota and tennessee 

we hold a 36 percent interest in an entity that owns and operates a 110milliongallonperyear ethanol production facility in clymers indiana we also own a 50 percent interest in an entity that owns a 110milliongallonperyear ethanol production facility in greenville ohio both of these facilities are managed by a coowner 

propane  we produce propane at all of our refineries propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers 

feedstocks and special products  we are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and specialty products product availability varies by refinery and includes propylene cumene molten sulfur toluene benzene xylene and dilute naphthalene oil we market all products domestically to customers in the chemical agricultural and fuel blending industries in addition we produce fuelgrade coke at our garyville and detroit refineries which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications and anodegrade coke at our robinson refinery which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry 

heavy fuel oil  we produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components at all of our refineries heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering fuel industries though there are other more specialized uses of the product 

asphalt  we have refinerybased asphalt production capacity of up to 98 mbpcd we market asphalt through 31 owned or leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast we have a broad customer base including asphaltpaving contractors government entities states counties cities and townships and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers we sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail barge and vessel we also produce asphalt cements polymer modified asphalt emulsified asphalt and industrial asphalts 

  

refined product distribution 

as of december 31 2012 we owned and operated 61 light product and 21 asphalt terminals the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets on february 1 2013 increased our number of owned and operated light product terminals to 65 our light product and asphalt terminals averaged 1278 mbpd and 31 mbpd of throughput in 2012 respectively in addition we distribute refined products through one leased light product terminal two light product terminals in which we have partial ownership interests but do not operate and approximately 61 thirdparty light product and 10 thirdparty asphalt terminals in our market area the following table sets forth additional details about our owned and operated terminals at december 31 2012 

 

   

as of december 31 2012 our marine transportation operations included 15 towboats as well as 177 owned and 14 leased barges that transport refined products on the ohio mississippi and illinois rivers and their tributaries and intercoastal waterways the following table sets forth additional details about our towboats and barges 

 

  

 as of december 31 2012 we owned 142 transport trucks and 150 trailers with an aggregate capacity of 14 million gallons for the movement of refined products in addition we had 1944 leased and 27 owned railcars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of refined products the following table sets forth additional details about our railcars 

 

 galveston bay refinery and related assets 

our galveston bay refinery which we acquired on february 1 2013 is located on the texas gulf coast approximately 30 miles southeast of houston texas the refinery has a crude oil refining capacity of 451 mbpcd and storage tank shell capacity of approximately 16 million barrels the refinery can process almost any grade of crude oil into products such as gasoline distillates fuelgrade coke slurry propylene propane and aromatics our cogeneration facility which supplies the galveston bay refinery has 1040 megawatts of electrical production capacity and can produce 46 million pounds of steam per hour 

the four light product terminals we acquired are located in nashville tennessee charlotte north carolina selma north carolina and jacksonville florida the terminals have 42 storage tanks with aggregate shell capacity of 227 million barrels and 19 loading lanes 

the assignment of brandedjobber contracts represents approximately 1200 retail outlets primarily in florida mississippi tennessee and alabama 

speedway 

our speedway segment sells gasoline and merchandise through convenience stores that it owns and operates primarily under the speedway brand diesel fuel is also sold at the vast majority of these convenience stores speedway brand convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise such as prepared foods beverages and nonfood items including a number of privatelabel items speedy rewards™ an industryleading customer loyalty program has achieved significant customer engagement over the years since its introduction in 2004 the average monthly active membership in 2012 was more than three million customers 

  

as of december 31 2012 speedway had 1464 convenience stores in seven states revenues from sales of merchandise including sales until december 1 2010 from convenience stores we sold as part of the minnesota assets totaled 306 billion in 2012 292 billion in 2011 and 320 billion in 2010 the demand for gasoline is seasonal with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel 

as of december 31 2012 the speedway segment’s convenience stores were located in the following states 

 

 harris interactive’s annual harris poll equitrend ® brand equity study named speedway the number one convenience store brand with consumers nationally for 2012 and the number one gasoline brand with consumers for each of the prior three years for 2011 speedway was presented with a convenience retailing award from csp information group inc for consumer experience provided by the speedy rewards™ program 

pipeline transportation 

as of december 31 2012 we owned leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8200 miles of crude oil and products pipelines of which approximately 2900 miles are owned through our investments in mplx and pipe line holdings the acquisition of approximately 100 miles of natural gas liquid pipelines on february 1 2013 increased the total mile count to approximately 8300 miles 

mplx 

in 2012 we formed mplx a master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on october 31 2012 mplx completed its initial public offering we own a 736 percent interest in mplx including the general partner interest mplx’s assets consist of a 51 percent general partner interest in pipe line holdings which owns common carrier pipeline systems through marathon pipe line llc “mpl” and ohio river pipe line llc “orpl” and a 100 percent interest in a one million barrel butane storage cavern in west virginia in addition we own the remaining 49 percent limited partner interest in pipe line holdings as of december 31 2012 pipe line holdings through mpl and orpl owned or leased and operated 1004 miles of common carrier crude oil lines and 1902 miles of common carrier products lines comprising 30 systems located in nine states and four tank farms in illinois and indiana with available storage capacity of 329 million barrels that is committed to mpc 

  

the table below sets forth additional detail regarding the pipeline systems and storage assets we own through pipe line holdings and mplx as of december 31 2012 

 

  

   the pipe line holdings common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the united states based on total volume delivered third parties generated 14 percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on these common carrier pipelines in 2012 excluding volumes shipped by mpc under joint tariffs with third parties these common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years 

 

  

    

mpcretained assets and investments 

in addition to our 49 ownership interest in pipe line holdings we retained ownership interests in several crude oil and products pipeline systems and pipeline companies as of december 31 2012 we owned undivided joint interests in the following common carrier crude oil pipeline systems 

 

 mpc consolidated volumes transported through our common carrier pipelines which include mplx and our undivided joint interests are shown in the following table for each of the last three years 

 

 as of december 31 2012 we had partial ownership interests in the following pipeline companies 

 

  

   

we also own 183 miles of private crude oil pipelines and 658 miles of private refined products pipelines that are operated by mpl for the benefit of our refining  marketing segment on a cost recovery basis the following table provides additional information on these assets 

 

  

 as of december 31 2012 we owned 60 private tanks with storage capacity of approximately 65 million barrels which are located along mplx pipelines 

galveston bay refinery and related assets 

as part of the february 1 2013 acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets we acquired approximately 100 miles of natural gas liquid pipelines consisting of three intrastate systems originating at the galveston bay refinery the pipelines are each eight inches in diameter and have a total capacity of approximately 40 mbpd 

competition market conditions and seasonality 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products based upon the “the oil  gas journal 2012 worldwide refinery survey” and our acquisition of the galveston bay refinery on february 1 2013 we ranked fourth among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity as of february 1 2013 we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale spot branded and retail distribution we believe we compete with about 60 companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers about 80 companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market 11 refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded dealers and jobbers and approximately 250 retailers in the retail sale of refined products in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers we do not produce any of the crude oil we refine 

  

we also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their dealers and jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers often selling gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise at aggressively competitive prices nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into the retail transportation fuel business energy analysts international inc estimates such retailers had 124 percent of the us gasoline market in 2012 

our pipeline transportation operations are highly regulated which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

environmental matters 

our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for reviewing our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs we also have a corporate emergency response team composed primarily of senior management which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review discussion or implementation the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant for additional information see item 1a risk factors we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products we produce additionally we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective 

our operations are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these environmental laws and regulations include among others the clean air act with respect to air emissions the clean water act with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with any new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate at this time 

for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air water solid waste and remediation see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental matters and compliance costs 

  

air 

we are subject to substantial requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations the us environmental protection agency “epa” issued an “endangerment finding” in 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to this endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emissions standard for mobile sources cars and light duty vehicles the endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act and the epa’s socalled “tailoring rule” led to permitting of larger stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions including refineries legal challenges filed against these epa actions were overruled by the dc circuit court of appeals but several parties will seek further review by the us supreme court we also expect refineryspecific new source performance standards will be proposed in 2013 congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax private parties have sued utilities and other emitters of greenhouse gas emissions but we have not been named in any of those lawsuits privateparty litigation is also pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken although there may be an adverse financial impact including compliance costs potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for certain refined products made from crude oil associated with any legislation regulation litigation or other action the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 

of particular significance to our refining operations were epa mobile source air toxics ii “msat ii” regulations that require reduced benzene levels in refined products we spent approximately 620 million over a fouryear period to complete all msat ii projects and all units were in operation as of december 31 2011 

the epa has reviewed and has revised or will propose to revise the national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” for criteria air pollutants the naaqs are subject to multiple court challenges making final compliance plans uncertain the epa promulgated a revised ozone standard in march 2008 and commenced a multiyear process to develop the implementing rules required by the clean air act in 2013 the epa is expected to propose a stricter ozone standard as part of epa’s periodic review of that standard also in 2010 the epa adopted new shortterm standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide and in december 2012 issued a more stringent fine particulate matter pm 25 standard we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these proposed and revised naaqs standards until the standards are finalized individual state implementing rules are established and judicial challenges are resolved 

in december 2012 the epa signed final reconsideration amendments to the boiler and process heater maximum achievable control technology “boiler mact” rule this rule had been finalized in march 2011 with work practice standards that are applicable to refinery and natural gas fired equipment while epa retained the work practice standards for most refinery equipment we are currently evaluating the financial impact of the boiler mact rule as a result of the reconsideration amendments further changes to the rule may occur because of potential litigation 

in 2013 the epa is expected to propose a refinery sector rule this rule may require various refinery unit modifications additional controls lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of this rule until it is proposed and finalized 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the clean water act and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts in addition we are regulated under opa90 which among other requirements requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances also in case of any such release opa90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages opa90 also 

  

provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements 

additionally opa90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be doublehulled and that existing tank vessels that are not doublehulled be retrofitted or removed from us service according to a phaseout schedule all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the doublehulled requirements of opa90 we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks “usts” containing regulated substances we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite thirdparty treatment and disposal facilities ongoing rcrarelated costs however are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain retail outlets where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery terminal and pipeline locations penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

mileage standards renewable fuels and other fuels requirements 

in 2007 the us congress passed the energy independence and security act “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 and contains a second renewable fuel standard the “rfs2” in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry 

  

fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking 

the rfs2 requires 1655 billion gallons of renewable fuel usage in 2013 increasing to 360 billion gallons by 2022 in the near term the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline the rfs2 presents production and logistic challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining and marketing industries the rfs2 has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use 

within the overall 360 billion gallon rfs2 eisa established an advanced biofuel rfs2 volume of 20 billion gallons in 2012 increasing to 210 billion gallons in 2022 subsets within the advanced biofuel rfs2 include biomassbased diesel which was set at 10 billion gallons in 2012 and at least 10 billion gallons in 2013 through 2022 to be determined by the epa through future rulemaking and cellulosic biofuel which was set at 05 billion gallons in 2012 10 billion gallons in 2013 increasing to 160 billion gallons by 2022 the epa established the 2013 biomassbased diesel requirement at 128 billion gallons the epa determined that 05 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel would not be produced in 2012 and lowered the requirement to 865 million gallons the american petroleum institute challenged the epa 2012 cellulosic biofuel requirement and the dc circuit court of appeals vacated the requirement finding that it was unlawfully determined and remanded it for further determination 

the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels including biomassbased diesel and cellulosic biofuel with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels the advanced requirement for 2012 required a substantial level of brazilian sugarcane ethanol imports since other sources of advanced renewable fuels were not available in 2012 the epa also discovered that 140 million biodiesel renewable identification numbers “rins” used to meet the annual requirement for that fuel had been fraudulently created and sold to unsuspecting third parties including us 

we made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel rfs2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product and by buying needed biodiesel rins in the epacreated biodiesel rins market 

on october 13 2010 the epa issued a partial waiver decision under the clean air act to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10 percent “e10” to 15 percent “e15” for 2007 and newer lightduty motor vehicles on january 21 2011 the epa issued a second waiver for the use of e15 in vehicles model year 20012006 there are numerous issues including state and federal regulatory issues which need to be addressed before e15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines 

there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in eisa and related regulations we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 

the epa tier 3 gasoline rulemaking could potentially lower the allowable sulfur level in gasoline but it may also lower the reid vapor pressure and the allowable benzene aromatics and olefins content of gasoline while possibly increasing octane requirements we anticipate a proposed rule will be issued in 2013 and plan to participate in the public comment process

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate while others relate principally to our spinoff from marathon oil the ownership of our common stock and securities markets generally 

our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our industry and our business 

failure to identify and manage risks inherent in our industry could adversely impact our business 

our business requires us to identify and manage the risks inherent to the refining marketing and transportation business in which we operate our operations are subject to business interruption due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and to unplanned maintenance or events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents severe weather and labor disputes such incidents may result in personal injury loss of life environmental damage legal liability and loss of revenue failure to identify and manage these risks could result in explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage property damage legal liability loss of revenue and substantial fines by governmental authorities 

a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products the measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil or crack spread is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins historically refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future our margins and cost of producing gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions the overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins many of the factors influencing the change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before refining them and selling the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined product we produce which may reduce our revenues operating income and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets 

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing gross margins 

the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies producing companies and trading companies including suppliers from canada the middle east and various other international locations we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from those areas if one or more of our major supply sources were eliminated or if political events disrupted our traditional crude oil supply we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our operations sales of refined products and refining and marketing margins could be adversely affected materially and adversely impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states the “us” and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products additionally these risks could increase instability in the 

  

financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate additionally tax policy legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries 

changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin laws and regulations relating to the emission or discharge of materials into the environment solid and hazardous waste management pollution prevention greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels as well as those relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security in particular are expected to become more stringent the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we believe the issue of climate change will likely continue to receive scientific and political attention with the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations the us pledge in 2009 as part of the copenhagen accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect meetings of the united nations climate change conference however have produced no legally binding emission reduction requirements on the us also in 2009 the epa issued a finding that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare related to the endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles the endangerment finding the mobile source standard and the epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act and the epa’s socalled “tailoring rule” led to permitting of larger stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions including refineries we also expect refineryspecific new source performance standards will be proposed in 2013 legal challenges were filed against these epa actions the dc circuit court of appeals overruled these challenges but several parties will seek further review by the us supreme court 

in the future congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax other measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review or implementation in the us these measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions private party litigation is pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken these actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented although uncertain these developments could increase our costs reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 

the eisa among other things sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the us by model year 2020 and contains a second renewable fuel standard commonly referred to as rfs2 in august 2012 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and of up to 497 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking increases in fuel mileage standards and the increased use of renewable fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels may reduce demand for refined products 

  

the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach 152 billion gallons in 2012 and increases to 360 billion gallons by 2022 the rfs2 presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use the advanced biofuels program a subset of the rfs2 requirements creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations 

tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may further reduce refined product margins 

the epa tier 3 gasoline rulemaking could potentially lower the allowable sulfur level in gasoline but it may also lower the reid vapor pressure and the allowable benzene aromatics and olefins content of gasoline while possibly increasing octane requirements we anticipate a proposed rule will be issued in 2013 and plan to participate in the public comment process 

we have in the past owned or operated and currently own and operate convenience stores and other locations with usts in various states the operation of usts poses risks including soil and groundwater contamination at our previously or currently operated locations such contamination could result in substantial cleanup costs fines or civil liabilities 

we have in the past and will continue to dispose of various wastes at lawful disposal sites environmental laws including cercla and similar state laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when performed 

any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal penalties injunctions limiting our operations investigatory or remedial liabilities or impediments to construction of additional facilities or equipment 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial performance 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use payroll franchise withholding and property taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial performance additionally many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

we do not produce any of our crude oil supply some of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their crude oil from their own exploration and production activities competitors that have their own exploration and production activities may at times be able to offset losses from downstream operations with profits from upstream operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refined product margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have those competitors may have a greater ability to respond to volatile industry or market conditions such as shortages of crude oil or other feedstocks or intense price fluctuations 

  

the retail market is diverse and highly competitive and severe competition could adversely impact our business 

we also face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline diesel and merchandise our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices several nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business these nontraditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow because of their diversity integration of operations experienced management and greater resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market in addition these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts adversely affecting our profit margins additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses we do not insure against all such potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

our operations are subject to business interruption due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and to unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents or unplanned maintenance severe weather and labor disputes for example our pipelines provide a nearlyexclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries in such instances a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations profitability and cash flows of the connected refinery 

our operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities in addition our information technology systems and network infrastructure are subject to unauthorized access or attack which could result in the loss of sensitive business information systems interruptions or the disruption of our business operations to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans the level of protection and disaster recovery capability varies from site to site and there can be no guarantee such plans to the extent they are in place will be totally effective 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows historically we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 

as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance coverage have increased substantially and could escalate further certain insurance coverage could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example due to hurricane activity in recent years the availability of insurance coverage for our facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced 

  

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil or refined product to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain levels we could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920 which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens among other requirements to establish citizenship corporations that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 by us citizens if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred 

we have substantial debt obligations therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 

on february 1 2011 we completed the offering of senior notes aggregating 30 billion in principal amount at december 31 2012 our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations was 336 billion we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

a decrease in our debt and commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money andor limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us in classaction litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 38 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our detroit and texas city refineries are scheduled to expire in january 2014 and march 2015 respectively the contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our canton catlettsburg and galveston bay refineries are each scheduled to expire in january 2015 these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us or we may experience work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership mplx which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

significant transactions including the galveston bay refinery and related assets acquisition are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows 

any significant transaction including the galveston bay refinery and related assets acquisition involves potential risks including among other things 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 risks relating to our spinoff from marathon oil 

we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities and temporary limitations pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although the spinoff occurred in mid 2011 certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil however if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries whether accruing before on or after the spinoff we also agreed to be responsible for and indemnify marathon oil with respect to all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff or certain internal restructuring transactions failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368a and 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation warranty covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement in addition we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified taxrelated liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities at this time we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts the tax liabilities described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our company 

under the tax sharing agreement we could be limited for a period of time in our ability to pursue certain strategic or capital raising transactions in addition under some circumstances we could be liable for any adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in such transactions even if the spinoff’s status as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code remains intact the spinoff may result in significant us federal income tax 

  

liabilities to marathon oil under applicable provisions of the code if 50 percent or more of marathon oil’s stock or our stock is treated as having been acquired directly or indirectly by one or more persons as part of a plan that includes the spinoff under those provisions any acquisitions of marathon oil stock or our stock or similar acquisitions or any understanding arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding an acquisition of marathon oil stock or our stock or similar acquisitions within two years before or after the spinoff are subject to special scrutiny the process for determining whether an acquisition triggering those provisions has occurred is complex inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case if a direct or indirect acquisition of marathon oil stock or our stock resulted in a change in control as contemplated by those provisions marathon oil but not its stockholders would recognize a taxable gain 

under the tax sharing agreement there are also restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the separation to fail to qualify as a taxfree distribution and we are required to indemnify marathon oil against any such tax liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us or any of our affiliates or any person that after the spinoff is our affiliate we may be similarly liable if we breach certain other representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement we are also subject to restrictions on our ability to issue shares of our stock without satisfying certain conditions within the tax sharing agreement as a result of the foregoing we may be unable to engage in strategic or capital raising transactions that our stockholders might consider favorable or to structure potential transactions in the manner most favorable to us without adverse tax consequences if at all 

the spinoff could be determined not to qualify as a taxfree transaction and marathon oil and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify marathon oil for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

marathon oil received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spinoff qualifies as taxfree to marathon oil us and marathon oil stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a and related provisions of the code if the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect then marathon oil would not be able to continue to rely on the ruling we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations that were relied on in the private letter ruling to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect if notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling the spinoff were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code marathon oil would be subject to tax as if it had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares 

with respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed on marathon oil in connection with the spinoff and certain related transactions as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences as set forth in the private letter ruling we would be liable to marathon oil under the tax sharing agreement for any such taxes or liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us any of our affiliates or any person that after the spinoff is our affiliate we may be similarly liable if we breach specified representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement if we are required to indemnify marathon oil for taxes incurred as a result of the spinoff or certain related transactions being taxable to marathon oil it would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have potential liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil in connection with the spinoff that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions that were required to affect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon 

  

oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or it insurers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves if marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time 

  

to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders 

our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 

finally to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 percent our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock

 item 2 properties 

the location and general character of our refineries convenience stores pipeline systems and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1 business and are incorporated herein by reference the plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency in addition we believe that our properties and facilities are adequate for our operations and that our facilities are adequately maintained as of december 31 2012 we were the lessee under a number of cancellable and noncancellable leases for certain properties including land and building space office equipment storage facilities and transportation equipment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 24 for additional information regarding our leases 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are the subject of or a party to a number of pending or threatened legal actions contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters including laws and regulations relating to the environment some of these matters are discussed below 

litigation 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty while it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

kentucky emergency pricing litigation 

in may 2007 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against us and marathon oil in state court in franklin county kentucky for alleged violations of kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws following hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 the lawsuit alleges that we overcharged customers by 89 million during september and october 2005 the complaint seeks disgorgement of these sums as well as penalties under kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws we are vigorously defending this litigation we believe that this is the first lawsuit for damages and injunctive relief under the kentucky emergency pricing laws to progress this far and it contains many novel issues in may 2011 the kentucky attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in april and may 2011 under statewide price controls that were activated by the kentucky governor on april 26 2011 and which have since expired the court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief and the remainder of the 2011 claims likely will be resolved along with those dating from 2005 if the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably in its entirety it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse effect 

environmental proceedings 

during 2001 we entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act and other violations with the epa covering our refineries the settlement committed us to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to our refineries which are now complete we are working with the epa to terminate the new source review consent decree 

  

in january 2011 the epa notified us of 18 alleged violations of various statutory and regulatory provisions related to motor fuels some of which we had previously selfreported to the epa no formal enforcement action has been commenced and no demand for penalties has been asserted by the epa in connection with these alleged violations however it is possible that the epa could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with one or more of the alleged violations 

we have been subject to a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency “iepa” and the illinois attorney general’s office since 2002 concerning selfreporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at the robinson illinois refinery it is possible the iepa could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with this matter 

on january 3 2013 the louisiana department of environmental quality “ldeq” issued a consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty alleging violations related to selfreported air emission events occurring at our garyville louisiana refinery between the years of 2005 and 2011 it is possible the ldeq could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with this matter 

in january 2013 the epa notified our subsidiary marathon pipe line llc of alleged clean air act violations pertaining to a 2011 audit of our woodhaven michigan facility the resolution of this matter may result in a penalty in excess of 100000 

we are involved in a number of other environmental enforcement matters arising in the ordinary course of business while the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of each of these other matters is not likely to result in a penalty in excess of 100000 and that collectively the environmental proceedings described above and these other environmental enforcement matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

the spinoff and basis of presentation 

on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its rmt business into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil common stock in accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between marathon oil and mpc the distribution of mpc common stock was made on june 30 2011 with marathon oil stockholders receiving one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon oil common stock held following the spinoff marathon oil retained no ownership interest in mpc and each company had separate public ownership boards of directors and management on july 1 2011 our common stock began trading “regularway” on the nyse under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

prior to the spinoff on june 30 2011 our results of operations and cash flows consisted of the rmt business which represented a combined reporting entity subsequent to the spinoff our results of operations and cash flows consist of consolidated mpc activities all significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated the consolidated statements of income for periods prior to the spinoff include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by the marathon oil companies including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight accounting treasury tax legal procurement and information technology those allocations were based primarily on specific identification headcount or computer utilization our management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from the marathon oil companies are reasonable however the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a standalone company during those periods presented prior to the spinoff and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows had we been a standalone company during the periods presented actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure subsequent to the spinoff we are performing these functions using internal resources or services provided by third parties certain of which were provided by the marathon oil companies during a transition period pursuant to a transition services agreement which terminated june 30 2012 

corporate overview 

we are an independent petroleum refining marketing and transportation company as of december 31 2012 we owned and operated six refineries all located in the united states with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 125 mmbpcd the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery on february 1 2013 increased our crude oil refining capacity to approximately 17 mmbpcd our refineries supply refined products to resellers and 

  

consumers within our market areas including the midwest gulf coast and southeast regions of the united states we distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and a combination of mpcowned and thirdpartyowned trucking and rail assets as of december 31 2012 we owned leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8200 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas the acquisition of approximately 100 miles of natural gas liquid pipelines on february 1 2013 increased our pipeline mileage to approximately 8300 miles we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the united states on the basis of total volumes delivered 

our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing speedway and pipeline transportation each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer see item 1 business for additional information on our segments 

 

  

  

 net income attributable to mpc was 339 billion or 989 per diluted share in 2012 compared to 239 billion or 667 per diluted share in 2011 the increase was primarily due to our refining  marketing segment operations which generated income from operations of 510 billion in 2012 compared to 359 billion in 2011 the increase in refining  marketing segment income from operations was due to an improved refining and marketing gross margin which was primarily a result of larger light louisiana sweet crude oil “lls” 6321 crack spreads and wider sweetsour differentials 

in 2012 we completed a 22 billion excluding capitalized interest heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit refinery this project increased the refinery’s heavy crude oil refining capacity from 20 mbpcd to 100 mbpcd allowing it to process more heavy sour crude oils including canadian bitumen blends which have traded at a significant discount to light sweet crude oil in addition the project increased the refinery’s total crude oil refining capacity by approximately 14 mbpcd to 120 mbpcd we also continued to optimize our other refineries in 2012 which includes increasing our garyville refinery crude oil refining capacity from 490 mbpcd to 522 mbpcd as of december 31 2012 

our speedway segment generated income from operations of 310 million for 2012 compared to 271 million for 2011 the increase in 2012 was primarily due to increases in our merchandise gross margin and our gasoline and distillates gross margin partially offset by higher expenses associated with an increase in the number of convenience stores 

in 2012 speedway llc acquired 10 convenience stores located in the northern kentucky and southwestern ohio regions from road ranger llc in exchange for cash and a truck stop location in the chicago metropolitan area and 87 convenience stores situated throughout indiana and ohio from gasamerica services inc these acquisitions support our strategic initiative to increase speedway segment sales and complement our existing network of assets 

  

our pipeline transportation segment generated income from operations of 216 million for 2012 compared to 199 million for 2011 the increase primarily reflects higher transportation tariffs partially offset by higher mechanical integrity expenses and a reduction in income from a pipeline affiliate 

on february 1 2013 we acquired from bp the 451000 barrel per calendar day texas city texas refinery three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery an allocation of bp’s colonial pipeline company shipper history four light product terminals brandedjobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1200 branded sites and a 1040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility we refer to these assets as the “galveston bay refinery and related assets” the financial results and operating statistics included in this section do not include these assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 26 for additional information on the acquisition of these assets 

in 2012 we formed mplx a master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil refined products and other hydrocarbonbased products on october 31 2012 mplx completed its initial public offering of 19895000 common units which represented the sale by us of a 264 percent interest in mplx we own a 736 percent interest in mplx including the general partner interest and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest headquartered in findlay ohio mplx’s initial assets consist of a 51 percent general partner interest in pipe line holdings which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states and a 100 percent interest in a butane storage cavern in west virginia we own the remaining 49 percent limited partner interest in pipe line holdings the financial results and operating statistics in this section include 100 percent of these assets for all time periods presented see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 4 for additional information on mplx’s initial public offering 

in 2012 we signed a letter of intent with harvest pipeline company agreeing to jointly develop infrastructure that will facilitate transportation of hydrocarbon liquids production from the utica shale in eastern ohio and western pennsylvania the proposed project is expected to result in up to 24000 barrels per day of truck unloading capacity and a terminal capable of loading up to 50000 barrels per day onto barges on the ohio river at our wellsville ohio asphalt terminal 

in 2012 to increase access to bakken and canadian crude oil we agreed to be the anchor shipper on enbridge inc’s proposed southern access extension pipeline with an option to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in the pipeline this line will originate in flanagan illinois near chicago and terminate in patoka illinois a critical crude storage and blending hub and the origination point for crude supply to our four midwest refineries 

on february 1 2012 we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan enabling us to purchase up to 20 billion of mpc common stock over a twoyear period we entered into two asr programs in 2012 to repurchase shares of mpc common stock totaling 135 billion we received 27760674 shares under these programs in 2012 and 870947 shares in february 2013 on january 30 2013 we announced that our board of directors approved an additional 20 billion share repurchase authorization the board also extended the remaining 650 million share repurchase authorization announced on february 1 2012 for a total outstanding authorization of 265 billion through december 2014 

in 2012 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit agreement with an initial borrowing capacity of 20 billion and terminated our previous fouryear revolving credit agreement we subsequently amended this agreement to increase the borrowing capacity to 25 billion which became effective in february 2013 in conjunction with the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets also in 2012 mplx operations llc an affiliate of mpc and whollyowned subsidiary of mplx entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with an initial borrowing loan capacity of 500 million that became effective at the time of mplx’s initial public offering the agreement provides mplx with an independent source of liquidity 

  

as of december 31 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents of 486 billion and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under mpc’s revolving credit agreement or trade receivables securitization facility or mplx’s revolving credit agreement 

on december 1 2010 we completed the sale of the minnesota assets these assets included the 74000 barrel per calendar day st paul park refinery and associated terminals 166 convenience stores primarily branded superamerica ® including six stores in wisconsin along with the supermom’s bakery and commissary a baked goods and sandwich supply operation and certain associated trademarks superamerica franchising llc interests in pipeline assets in minnesota and associated inventories our financial results and operating statistics for all periods prior to the disposition include amounts for the minnesota assets 

the above discussion includes forwardlooking statements that relate to our expectations with respect to the proposed project with harvest pipeline company and the share repurchase plan factors that could affect the proposed project with harvest pipeline company include but are not limited to our ability to reach a definitive agreement with harvest pipeline company and the timing and extent of hydrocarbon liquids production and demand from the utica shale factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include but are not limited to business conditions availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining and marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs 

our refining and marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses including depreciation and amortization the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants we calculate midwest chicago and us gulf coast “usgc” crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products lls prices and a 6321 ratio of products 6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline 2 barrels of ultralow sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent sulfur residual fuel are used for these crackspread calculations 

our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil the amount of this discount the sweetsour differential can vary significantly causing our refining and marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude in general a larger sweetsour differential will enhance our refining and marketing gross margin 

historically wti has traded at prices similar to lls during 2012 and 2011 wti traded at prices significantly less than lls which favorably impacted our refining and marketing gross margin the logistical constraints in the us midcontinent markets have prevented the price of wti from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions future differentials will be dependent on changes made to the logistical infrastructure 

  

the following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in annual net income including the impact of the galveston bay refinery due to potential changes in market conditions 

 

  

   in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sweetsour differential and the discount of wti to lls our refining and marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as 

 

  

  

  

  

 changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries including purchased natural gas and the level of maintenance costs planned major maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years 

 

 the table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at december 31 of each year the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery not shown below on february 1 2013 increased our crude oil refining capacity to approximately 17 mmbpcd 

 

   

speedway 

our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products including transportation consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees impacts the speedway segment profitability numerous factors impact gasoline and distillates demand throughout the year including local competition seasonal demand fluctuations the available wholesale supply the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions the demand for gasoline in the midwest region is estimated to have declined by less than half a percent in 2012 after decreasing by more than two percent in 2011 stronger economic growth supported demand but was offset by slightly higher prices and increasing vehicle efficiency unseasonably warm winter weather early in 2012 contributed to an estimated one percent decline in midwest distillate demand in 2012 which followed a slight decrease in demand in 2011 market demand increases for gasoline and distillates generally increase the product margin we can realize the gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile approximately twothirds of speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2012 

pipeline transportation 

the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining  marketing segment in 2012 new transportation services agreements were entered into between mpc and mplx which resulted in higher tariff rates the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillates peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

  

results of operations 

years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 

consolidated results of operations 

 

 net income attributable to mpc was 100 billion higher in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin which increased to 1045 per barrel in 2012 from 775 per barrel in 2011 

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes increased 365 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increases in refined product selling prices and sales volumes crude oil and refinery feedstock sales volumes and consumer excise taxes 

sales to related parties decreased 47 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease resulted from lower refined product volumes sold to centennial pipeline llc “centennial” and sales to marathon oil after the spinoff no longer being classified as related party 

income from equity method investments decreased 24 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease resulted from an 18 million decrease in income from our ethanol investments and an 8 million decrease in income from our investment in loop llc “loop” our ethanol investments experienced lower product margins in 2012 primarily due to lower demand for corn ethanol and higher corn prices and loop experienced higher expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 additionally centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that continued in 2012 at december 31 2012 centennial was not shipping product as a result we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in centennial and concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on various uses for centennial’s assets 

  

other income decreased 13 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in income from transition services provided to the buyer of our minnesota assets and to marathon oil and a decrease in sales of renewable identification numbers these decreases were partially offset by 12 million of dividend income recognized in 2012 from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our minnesota assets which was paid in connection with our settlement agreement with the buyer see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 7 for additional information on the minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer 

cost of revenues increased 287 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher acquisition costs of crude oil and refined products in the refining  marketing segment which resulted from increased volumes partially offset by decreased prices the increase in crude oil volumes was partially due to purchases from marathon oil not being classified as related party purchases in periods subsequent to the spinoff these impacts were partially offset by decreased acquisition costs of other charge and blendstocks due to decreased volumes and prices crude oil volumes were up 6 percent and refined product volumes were up 8 percent while other charge and blendstocks volumes were down 7 percent crude oil acquisition prices were down 1 percent charge and blendstock prices were down 6 percent and purchased refined product prices were down 4 percent 

purchases from related parties decreased 164 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease was primarily due to purchases of crude oil from marathon oil after the spinoff not being classified as related party transactions 

consumer excise taxes increased 595 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the expiration of a federal excise tax credit for blending ethanol and increased excise tax in select states 

depreciation and amortization increased 104 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit refinery and speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 164 million in 2012 compared to 2011 employee compensation and benefit expenses comprised 141 million of the increase which was primarily due to 117 million of higher pension settlement expenses in 2012 and an increase in the number of administrative employees associated with being a standalone company for a full year in 2012 compared to half of the year in 2011 partially offset by a decrease in pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 22 for additional information on the pension settlements and the pension plan amendment contract service expenses increased 52 million primarily due to higher information technology costs higher refineryrelated contract services and contract services associated with the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets these impacts were partially offset by having no allocations from marathon oil subsequent to the spinoff 

other taxes increased 31 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increases in operating taxes of 11 million personal property taxes of 8 million real estate taxes of 7 million and franchise taxes of 6 million these increases were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit refinery speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores and higher feedstock inventory values 

related party net interest and other financial income decreased 34 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to our shortterm investments in preferred stock of moc portfolio delaware inc “pfd” a subsidiary of marathon oil being redeemed prior to the spinoff the agreement with pfd was terminated on june 30 2011 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 5 for further discussion of the pfd preferred stock 

  

net interest and other financial costs increased 49 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in interest expense associated with the 30 billion senior notes issued in february 2011 a decrease in foreign currency gains and an increase in bank service and other fees we capitalized thirdparty interest of 101 million in 2012 compared to 104 million in 2011 the capitalized interest was primarily associated with the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project 

provision for income taxes increased 515 million 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the 152 billion increase in income before income taxes the effective income tax rate decreased from 36 percent in 2011 to 35 percent in 2012 the 2012 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a decrease in adverse tax impacts from state legislation and other permanent benefit differences for years 2012 and 2011 adverse tax impacts of state legislation were 9 million and 19 million respectively the provision for income taxes for periods prior to the spinoff has been computed as if we were a standalone company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 13 for further details 

segment results 

revenues are summarized by segment in the following table 

 

 refining  marketing segment revenues increased 333 billion in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increased refined product selling prices and sales volumes our average refined product selling prices were 300 per gallon in 2012 compared to 293 per gallon in 2011 the table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas 

 

 refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment were 878 billion in 2012 compared to 830 billion in 2011 intersegment refined product sales volumes were 273 billion gallons in 2012 compared to 266 billion gallons in 2011 with the increased volumes primarily due to speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 

speedway segment revenues increased 753 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher gasoline and distillates sales volumes and selling prices which averaged 354 per gallon in 2012 compared to 344 per gallon in 2011 the speedway segment also had higher merchandise sales excluding cigarettes the increases in gasoline and distillates sales volumes and merchandise sales were primarily due to the acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 

  

pipeline transportation segment revenue increased 56 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher transportation tariffs resulting from increased tariff rates in 2012 and the startup of a new crude oil pipeline in 2012 

income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table 

 

  

     the following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business 

 

  

    refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 151 billion in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin per barrel which averaged 1045 per barrel in 2012 compared to 775 per barrel in 2011 our realized refining  marketing gross margin for 2012 benefited from increases in the chicago and usgc lls 6321 blended crack spread of 336 per barrel and the sweetsour differential of 336 per barrel in 2012 and we estimate these had positive impacts on our refining  marketing gross margin of 168 billion and 870 million respectively these favorable impacts on our refining  marketing gross margin for 2012 compared to 2011 were partially offset by higher cost realizations of the actual mix of crude oils we processed compared to market indicators and higher direct operating costs associated with higher planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses 

  

the following table summarizes our refinery throughputs for 2012 and 2011 

 

 the increase in crude oil throughput in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increased crude oil refining capacities of the garyville and catlettsburg refineries and the impacts of the planned turnarounds in 2012 and 2011 the decrease in other charge and blendstocks throughput in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the planned turnarounds in 2012 and a combination of increased crude oil throughput and feedstock economics at our garyville refinery in 2012 

within our refining system sour crude accounted for 53 percent and 52 percent of our crude oil processed in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the refining  marketing segment for 2012 and 2011 

 

  

    speedway segment income from operations increased 39 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increases in our merchandise gross margin and our gasoline and distillates gross margin partially offset by higher expenses attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores the increase in the merchandise gross margin was primarily due to margin expansion resulting from higher merchandise and food sales along with an increase in the number of convenience stores 

  

the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the speedway segment for 2012 and 2011 

 

  

 samestore gasoline sales volume decreased 08 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 while samestore merchandise sales excluding cigarettes increased 70 percent for the same period the primary factor affecting lower same store gasoline sales volume was lower gasoline demand in our market area 

pipeline transportation segment income from operations increased 17 million in 2012 from 2011 the increase primarily reflects higher transportation tariffs partially offset by higher mechanical integrity expenses and a reduction in income from loop 

corporate and other unallocated expenses increased 20 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to our administrative units realizing the impact of being a standalone company in 2012 compared to expenses incurred prior to the june 30 2011 spinoff partially offset by lower pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment in the second quarter of 2012 

we recognized a gain of 183 million in 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our minnesota assets which included 86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 7 for additional information on the minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer 

we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of 124 million in 2012 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred in 2012 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 22 for additional information on the pension plan amendments 

  

years ended december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

consolidated results of operations 

 

 consolidated net income was 177 billion higher in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin which increased to 775 per barrel in 2011 from 281 per barrel in 2010 

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes increased 1620 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher refined product selling prices 

sales to related parties decreased 45 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease resulted from sales to marathon oil after the spinoff no longer being classified as related party and lower refined product volumes sold to centennial partially offset by higher refined product selling prices 

income from equity method investments decreased 20 million from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to 12 million of increased losses from our investment in centennial centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 compared to the corresponding period of 2010 also 2010 included 4 million of income from an investment in a pipeline company that was included in the minnesota assets disposition 

other income increased 22 million in 2011 compared with 2010 due primarily to income from transition services provided to the purchaser of the minnesota assets and to marathon oil 

  

cost of revenues increased 1406 billion in 2011 from 2010 the increase was primarily the result of higher acquisition costs of crude oil refinery charge and blendstocks and refined products in the refining  marketing segment largely due to higher market prices crude oil acquisition prices were up 31 percent charge and blendstock prices were up 28 percent and purchased refined product prices were up 40 percent 

purchases from related parties decreased 677 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease was primarily due to purchases of crude oil from marathon oil after the spinoff not being classified as related party transactions 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 185 million in 2011 compared with 2010 employee compensation and benefits expenses comprised 81 million of the increase which is partially due to an increase in the number of administrative employees associated with being a standalone public company higher incentive compensation accruals related to 2011 performance and increased pension and postretirement benefit costs contract services expenses increased 62 million primarily due to higher information technology costs associated with being a separate standalone company in addition bankcard processing fees related to marathon brand sales increased 41 million primarily due to higher transportation fuel selling prices following the spinoff we no longer receive allocated corporate overhead costs from marathon oil 

related party net interest and other financial income increased 11 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflecting higher average balances of our shortterm investments in pfd preferred stock the agreement with pfd was terminated on june 30 2011 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 5 for further discussion of the pfd preferred stock 

net interest and other financial costs increased 49 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the 30 billion of longterm debt we issued in february 2011 we capitalized thirdparty interest of 104 million in 2011 compared to 17 million in 2010 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20 for further details relating to our debt 

provision for income taxes increased 930 million from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to the 270 billion increase in income before income taxes the effective income tax rate decreased from 39 percent in 2010 to 36 percent in 2011 the 2011 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by an increase in income qualifying for the domestic manufacturing deduction and a decrease in the effective tax rate for state taxes the year 2011 included a 19 million adverse tax impact of state legislative changes primarily in michigan and 2010 included a 26 million adverse tax impact of federal legislative changes the provision for income taxes for periods prior to the spinoff has been computed as if we were a standalone company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 13 for further details 

segment results 

revenues are summarized by segment in the following table 

 

   

refining  marketing segment revenues increased 1605 billion in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increased refined product selling prices our average refined product selling prices were 293 per gallon in 2011 compared to 224 per gallon in 2010 the table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas 

 

 refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment were 830 billion in 2011 compared to 739 billion in 2010 intersegment refined product sales volumes were 266 billion gallons in 2011 compared to 311 billion gallons in 2010 with the decreased volumes primarily due to the minnesota assets disposition 

speedway segment revenues increased 996 million from 2010 to 2011 mainly due to higher gasoline and distillates selling prices which averaged 344 per gallon in 2011 compared to 270 per gallon in 2010 these impacts were partially offset by decreased gasoline and distillates sales volumes and lower merchandise sales primarily due to the minnesota assets disposition in december 2010

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 279 billion in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin per barrel which averaged 775 per barrel in 2011 compared to 281 per barrel in 2010 our realized refining and marketing gross margin for 2011 improved from 2010 primarily due to wider differentials between wti and other light sweet crudes such as lls larger lls 6321 crack spreads and wider sweetsour differentials the discount of wti to lls increased 1404 per barrel as a result of logistical constraints in the us midcontinent markets which prevented the price of wti from rising with the prices of crudes produced in other regions we estimate this had a 169 billion positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin the chicago and usgc lls 6321 crack spreads increased 079 per barrel and 071 per barrel respectively and we estimate this had a 349 million positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin the sweetsour differential widened 154 per barrel and we estimate this had a 277 million positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin within our refining system sour crude accounted for 52 percent and 54 percent of our crude oil processed in 2011 and 2010 respectively direct operating costs declined 248 million from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to a 188 million reduction in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs which also contributed to the increase in gross margin 

the following table summarizes our refinery throughputs for 2011 and 2010 

 

 our total refinery throughputs were two percent higher in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to improved refinery utilization and decreased turnaround activity in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily at our garyville refinery partially offset by the sale of the st paul park refinery in december 2010 crude oil refined was essentially flat in 2011 compared to 2010 while other charge and blendstock throughputs increased 12 percent over the same period 

the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the refining  marketing segment for 2011 and 2010 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

speedway segment income from operations decreased 22 million from 2010 to 2011 with 45 million attributable to the sale of 166 convenience stores that were part of the minnesota assets disposition in december 2010 and 33 million attributable to increased operating expenses partially due to higher employee costs these decreases were partially offset by a 30 million increase associated with a higher gasoline and distillates gross margin and a 26 million increase associated with a higher merchandise gross margin speedway’s gasoline and distillates gross margin per gallon averaged 1308 cents in 2011 compared with 1207 cents in 2010 gasoline and distillates sales volumes declined in 2011 primarily reflecting the sale of the minnesota assets merchandise gross margin was 719 million in 2011 compared to 789 million in 2010 also reflecting the minnesota assets disposition 

samestore gasoline sales volume decreased 17 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 while samestore merchandise sales excluding cigarettes increased 67 percent for the same period the primary factor affecting same store gasoline sales volume was the higher average retail price of gasoline 

pipeline transportation segment income from operations increased 16 million in 2011 from 2010 the increase primarily reflects the absence of nonroutine maintenance and impairment expenses incurred in 2010 partially offset by a reduction in income from pipeline equity method investments refined product throughput volumes increased seven percent in 2011 compared to 2010 while crude oil throughput volumes decreased two percent in the same period 

corporate and other unallocated items increased 80 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher information technology employee benefits and other administrative expenses partially resulting from costs associated with being a standalone company following the spinoff we no longer receive allocated corporate overhead costs from marathon oil 

impairment expense in 2010 was a 29 million property impairment related to a maleic anhydride plant which was operated by our refining  marketing segment 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 486 billion at december 31 2012 compared to 308 billion at december 31 2011 net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table 

 

 net cash provided from operating activities increased 118 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher net income and noncash income adjustments in 2012 partially offset by changes in working capital net cash provided from operating activities increased 109 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher net income in 2011 partially offset by changes in working capital and lower deferred income taxes 

  

changes in working capital were a net 428 million use of cash in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and payable volumes partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and receivable volumes changes in working capital were a net 13 million source of cash in 2011 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from increases in crude oil prices and payable volumes partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable resulting primarily from increases in crude oil prices and receivable volumes and refined product prices changes in working capital were a net 318 million source of cash in 2010 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from increases in crude oil prices and payable volumes partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable resulting primarily from increases in crude oil and refined product prices and crude oil receivable volumes 

cash flows from investing activities decreased 275 billion in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased 344 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 the investing activity is further discussed below 

the consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash a reconciliation of additions to property plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years 

 

  

 capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below 

 

  

  

 the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project which we completed in 2012 comprised 46 percent 59 percent and 50 percent excluding capitalized interest associated with this project of our refining  marketing segment capital spending in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

cash used in acquisitions as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows totaled 190 million in 2012 and 74 million in 2011 which relates to the 97 convenience stores speedway acquired in 2012 and the 23 convenience stores speedway acquired in 2011 

cash provided by disposal of assets totaled 53 million 144 million and 763 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the 53 million of cash from asset disposals in 2012 primarily included proceeds from a settlement 

  

agreement with the buyer of our minnesota assets the 144 million of cash from asset disposals in 2011 primarily included the collection of a receivable associated with the sale of the minnesota assets in 2010 disposal of assets primarily included proceeds from the original sale of the minnesota assets 

net investments in related party debt securities was a source of cash of 240 billion in 2011 and a use of cash of 169 billion in 2010 all such activity reflected the net cash flow from redemptions and purchases of pfd preferred stock prior to the spinoff all investments in pfd preferred stock were redeemed and the agreement with pfd was terminated see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 5 for further discussion of our investments in pfd preferred stock 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 126 billion in 2012 164 billion in 2011 and 82 million in 2010 the net use of cash in 2012 was primarily due to the common stock repurchases under our asr programs and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of mplx common units the use of cash in 2011 was primarily due to the net repayment of debt payable to marathon oil and its subsidiaries and net distributions to marathon oil partially offset by cash provided from the issuance of longterm debt these 2011 activities were undertaken to effect the spinoff the year 2011 also included a use of cash of 60 million for debt issuance costs associated with the 30 billion of senior notes our 20 billion revolving credit agreement and our 10 billion trade receivables securitization facility see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20 for additional information on our longterm debt the net use of cash in 2010 was primarily due to distributions to marathon oil partially offset by net borrowings of debt payable to marathon oil 

cash used in common stock repurchases totaled 135 billion in 2012 associated with the share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors we entered into an 850 million asr program on february 3 2012 under which we repurchased 20357380 shares at an average cost of 4175 per share and a 500 million asr program on november 5 2012 under which we received 7403294 shares as of december 31 2012 and 870947 shares in february 2013 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 10 for further discussion of the share repurchase plan 

cash used in dividend payments increased 247 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to having a full year of dividend payments in 2012 and a 75 percent increase in our base dividend since july 2011 partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to the asr programs our quarterly dividend began at 20 cents per common share in july 2011 and has increased to 35 cents per common share as of december 31 2012 

cash proceeds from the issuance of mplx common units was 407 million in 2012 of which 203 million was distributed by mplx to mpc in partial consideration of assets we contributed to mplx and to reimburse us for certain capital expenditures incurred with respect to those assets the initial public offering represented the sale of a 264 percent interest in mplx see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 for further discussion of mplx and its initial public offering 

net borrowings and repayments under our longterm debt payable to marathon oil and its subsidiaries was a use of cash of 362 billion in 2011 compared with a source of cash of 126 billion in 2010 the agreements with marathon oil and its subsidiaries were terminated in 2011 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 5 for further discussion of these financing agreements 

net distributions to marathon oil totaled 783 million in 2011 and 133 billion in 2010 the net distribution in 2011 was primarily related to 147 billion in net cash distributions paid to marathon oil partially offset by income taxes it incurred on our behalf the net distribution in 2010 was primarily related to 148 billion in cash distributions paid to marathon oil 

derivative instruments 

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk 

  

capital resources 

our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile as of december 31 2012 our liquidity totaled 786 billion consisting of 

 

  

 as of december 31 2012 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreement or our trade receivables securitization facility 

because of the alternatives available to us including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm and longterm funding requirements including capital spending programs the repurchase of shares of our common stock dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies 

on september 14 2012 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a syndicate of lenders and terminated our previous fouryear revolving credit agreement the credit agreement was amended on december 20 2012 to increase the borrowing capacity by 500 million to a total of 25 billion the commitment increase became effective on february 1 2013 in conjunction with the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets the credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to 20 billion and swingline loan capacity of up to 100 million we may increase the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement by up to an additional 500 million subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased in addition we may request that the term of the credit agreement which expires on september 14 2017 be extended for up to two additional oneyear periods each such extension would be subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding and the commitment of any lender that does not consent to an extension of the maturity date will be terminated on the theneffective maturity date 

the credit agreement contains representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type the financial covenant included in the credit agreement requires us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated net debt as defined in the credit agreement to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no greater than 065 to 100 as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 01 to 100 as well as the other covenants contained in the credit agreement in addition the credit agreement includes limitations on the indebtedness of our subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the credit agreement and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur liens on property or assets or enter into certain transactions with affiliates 

borrowings of revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either i the sum of the adjusted libo rate as defined in the credit agreement and a margin ranging between 100 percent to 200 percent depending on our credit ratings or ii the sum of the alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement and a margin ranging between zero percent to 100 percent depending on our credit ratings the credit agreement also provides for customary fees including administrative agent fees annual commitment fees ranging from 010 percent to 035 percent depending on our credit ratings on the unused portion fees in respect to letters of credit and other fees 

  

on september 14 2012 mplx operations llc an affiliate of mpc and whollyowned subsidiary of mplx as the borrower and mplx as the parent guarantor entered into a fiveyear revolving credit agreement “mplx credit agreement” with a syndicate of lenders the mplx credit agreement became effective following mplx’s initial public offering and has an initial borrowing capacity of 500 million mplx may increase the borrowing capacity under the mplx credit agreement by up to an additional 300 million subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased the mplx credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to 250 million and swingline loan capacity of up to 50 million mplx may subject to certain conditions request that the term of the mplx credit agreement which expires on october 31 2017 be extended for up to two additional oneyear periods each such extension would be subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding and the commitment of any lender that does not consent to an extension of the maturity date will be terminated on the theneffective maturity date at december 31 2012 mplx had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this agreement 

the mplx credit agreement contains representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of that type the financial covenant included in the mplx credit agreement requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as defined in the mplx credit agreement as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda as defined in the mplx credit agreement for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 50 to 10 or 55 to 10 during the sixmonth period following certain acquisitions as of december 31 2012 mplx was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 01 to 10 as well as the other covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement 

borrowings of revolving loans under the mplx credit agreement bear interest at either i the sum of the adjusted libo rate as defined in the mplx credit agreement and a margin ranging from 100 percent to 200 percent or ii the sum of the alternate base rate as defined in the mplx credit agreement and a margin ranging from zero percent to 100 percent prior to mplx receiving a rating from standard  poor’s rating group or moody’s investor service inc for its index debt as defined in the mplx credit agreement the margin that is added to the applicable interest rate is based on mplx’s ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters once mplx receives a rating the margin added to the applicable interest rate will be based on mplx’s credit ratings the mplx credit agreement also provides for customary fees including administrative agent fees commitment fees ranging from 010 percent to 035 percent of the unused portion depending on mplx’s ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters prior to the rating date or mplx’s credit ratings subsequent to the rating date fronting and issuance fees in respect to letters of credit and other fees 

as of december 31 2012 the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows 

 

 the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

neither our credit agreement the mplx credit agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under our 

  

credit agreement the mplx credit agreement and trade receivables securitization facility in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could under certain circumstances decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility and could potentially impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis 

debttototalcapital ratio 

our debttototal capital ratio total debt to total debtplusequity was 22 percent and 26 percent at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

 

 capital requirements 

we have a capital and investment budget for 2013 of 162 billion excluding capitalized interest and the purchase price for the galveston bay refinery and related assets additional details related to the 2013 capital and investment budget are discussed in the outlook section below 

on february 1 2013 we acquired the galveston bay refinery and related assets for approximately 598 million plus approximately 900 million for inventory pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement we may also be required to pay bp a contingent earnout of up to an additional 700 million over six years subject to certain conditions this acquisition was paid for with cash on hand 

we plan to make contributions of approximately 160 million to our funded pension plans in 2013 

on january 30 2013 our board of directors approved a 35 cents per share dividend payable march 11 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 20 2013 

on february 1 2012 we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan enabling us to purchase up to 20 billion of our common stock on january 30 2013 our board of directors approved an additional 20 billion share repurchase authorization and extended the unused amounts remaining on the february 1 2012 authorization with both authorizations ending december 2014 after the effects of the asr programs described below 265 billion of the 40 billion total share repurchase authorization is available we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market purchases negotiated block transactions asrs or open market solicitations for shares some of which may be effected through rule 10b51 plans the timing of future repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time 

on february 3 2012 we entered into an 850 million asr program with a major financial institution as part of this authorization under this asr program we received 20357380 shares of our common stock in 2012 resulting in an average per share cost for these shares of 4175 

  

on november 5 2012 we entered into a second asr program for 500 million under this asr program we received 7403294 shares of our common stock in 2012 and 870947 shares in february 2013 for a total of 8274241 repurchased shares which concluded this asr program upon final settlement the average per share cost for all shares purchased under this asr program was 6043 

these asr programs are accounted for as treasury stock purchase transactions reducing the weighted average number of basic and diluted common shares outstanding by the repurchased shares and as forward contracts indexed to our common stock 

the above discussion of the share repurchase authorization includes forwardlooking statements factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include but are not limited to business conditions availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

contractual cash obligations 

the table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31 2012 the contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to mplx under various feebased commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements the contractual obligations detailed below include amounts paid at closing for the galveston bay refinery and related assets but do not include obligations assumed upon closing 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity capital resources and results of operations even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states although offbalance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the offbalance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources 

we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil these arrangements are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 25 

outlook 

we have a capital and investment budget for 2013 of 162 billion excluding capitalized interest and the purchase price for the galveston bay refinery and related assets this represents a 19 percent increase from our 2012 spending which is primarily due to increases in the refining  marketing segment the budget includes spending on refining retail marketing transportation logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

refining  marketing 

the 2013 capital budget includes 102 billion for our refining  marketing segment the refining  marketing capital budget includes approximately 400 million for our galveston bay refinery and related assets for synergy capital and the continuation of infrastructure investments and other programs begun by the prior owner 

at our garyville refinery we have projects underway to optimize diesel and gasoline yields through modifications to the older crude unit hydrocracker and the distillate hydrotreaters total capital spending is estimated at 225 million with projected capital spending of 117 million in 2013 the hydrocracker revamp is expected to be completed in 2014 and the completion of the final phase of the program is expected in 2015 

at our robinson refinery we have a 75 million project to revamp our distillate hydrocracker to improve margins by processing more feedstock at a lower conversion and shifting approximately 10 mbpd of other products to diesel production the amount of capital spending budgeted for this project in 2013 is 15 million the project is expected to be completed in 2015 

  

at our catlettsburg refinery we have a 25 million project underway to recover additional volumes of gas oil from the refinery’s residual oil production to be processed in the fluidized catalytic cracker thus increasing the production of higher valued gasoline and diesel the amount of capital spending budgeted for this project in 2013 is 9 million this project is expected to be completed in 2014 

our refining  marketing and pipeline transportation segments have approximately 300 million of capital projects that will allow us to process and handle crude oil and condensate from the utica shale region of which approximately 110 million have been budgeted for in 2013 we have projects to invest in condensate splitters at our canton and catlettsburg refineries to allow the refineries to process up to 60 mbpd of condensate from the utica shale region in addition we have a trucktobarge crude system project at our wellsville asphalt terminal and expect to purchase new barges to allow utica production to be transported from our wellsville terminal to our catlettsburg refinery 

the remaining budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements at our refineries 

speedway 

the 2013 capital budget includes 255 million for our speedway segment relating to new construction and acquisitions to expand our markets and remodeling and rebuilding projects for existing convenience stores to upgrade and enhance our existing facilities also included in the capital budget are expenditures for dispenser equipment and technology upgrades 

pipeline transportation 

the 2013 capital budget includes 184 million for our pipeline transportation segment primarily for upgrades to replace or enhance our existing facilities including our patoka to catlettsburg crude oil pipeline upgrade and new infrastructure 

corporate and other 

the remaining 2013 capital budget includes 160 million primarily related to upgrades to information technology systems 

in addition we expect to record 43 million in capitalized interest which is 57 percent less than 2012 primarily due to the completion of the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project 

our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forwardlooking statements are based on currently available information if this information proves to be inaccurate future availability of financing may be adversely affected factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided by operating activities the state of worldwide debt and equity markets investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance the global financial climate and in particular with respect to borrowings the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies the discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forwardlooking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending costs for projects under construction project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth upgrades and expansion the forwardlooking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance actual results may differ materially from these expectations estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products actions of competitors delays in obtaining necessary thirdparty approvals changes in labor materials and equipment costs and availability planned and unplanned outages the delay of cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects project cost 

  

overruns disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response and other operating and economic considerations 

transactions with related parties 

following completion of the spinoff on june 30 2011 marathon oil retained no ownership interest in us and is no longer a related party 

purchases of crude oil and natural gas from marathon oil accounted for five percent or less of our total cost of revenues and purchases from related parties for the periods prior to the spinoff related party purchases of crude oil and natural gas from marathon oil were at marketbased contract prices the crude oil prices were based on indices that represented market value for time and place of delivery and that were also used in thirdparty contracts the natural gas prices equaled the price at which marathon oil purchased the natural gas from third parties plus the cost of transportation 

we believe that transactions with related parties other than certain transactions with marathon oil to effect the spinoff and related to the provision of administrative services were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties 

on may 25 2011 we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with marathon oil to effect the spinoff and to provide a framework for our relationship with marathon oil because the terms of our separation from marathon oil and these agreements were entered into in the context of a relatedparty transaction the terms may not be comparable to terms that would be obtained in a transaction between unaffiliated parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 5 for further discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers for additional information see item 1a risk factors 

  

our environmental expenditures based on the american petroleum institute’s definition of environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were 

 

  we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation or regulations it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 8 percent 13 percent and 19 percent of capital expenditures in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 41 million or three percent of total capital expenditures in 2013 predictions beyond 2013 can only be broadbased estimates which have varied and will continue to vary due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies among other matters based on currently identified projects we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately 86 million in 2014 however actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 

we spent 620 million from 2008 through 2011 to comply with msat ii regulations relating to benzene content in refined products all msat ii compliance units were in operation in 2011 

for more information on environmental regulations that impact us or could impact us see item 1 business—environmental matters item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

  

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

 

  

  

 valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 18 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

impairment assessments of longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions significant assumptions include 

 

  

  

  

 we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a poor outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes significant reduction in refining margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets site level for speedway segment convenience stores or the pipeline system level for pipeline transportation segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value 

unlike longlived assets goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at december 31 2012 we had a total of 930 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value appreciably for each of our reporting units in 2012 

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value at december 31 2012 we had 321 million of investments in equity method investments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

  

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value a large volume of our commodity derivatives are exchangetraded and require few assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 18 additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 

 

    we develop our demographics and utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuary’s discount rate model this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 345 percent for our pension plans and 405 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 85 million and 21 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 6 million and 2 million respectively 

the longterm asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent fixed income securities for the funded pension plans past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns in addition our longterm asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness after evaluating activity in the capital markets we reduced the asset rate of return from 850 percent to 750 percent effective for 2012 we have also used the 750 percent longterm rate of return to determine our 2013 defined benefit pension expense decreasing the 750 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 4 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 22 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

  

contingent liabilities 

we accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions claims litigation environmental remediation tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and thirdparty indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable we regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons for instance settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes which are recorded as other taxes for additional information on contingent liabilities see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters and compliance costs 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standards update that requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period an entity is required to present either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income for other amounts not required to be reclassed in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts the accounting standards update is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after december 15 2012 and interim periods within those annual periods adoption of this accounting standards update in the first quarter of 2013 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in july 2012 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that gives an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if through the qualitative assessment an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired the quantitative impairment test must then be performed the accounting standards update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 early adoption is permitted adoption of this accounting standards update in the first quarter of 2013 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in december 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which was amended in january 2013 that requires disclosure of additional information related to recognized derivative instruments repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are offset or are not offset but are subject to an enforceable netting agreement the purpose of the requirement is to help users evaluate the effect or potential effect of offsetting and related netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position the update is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods that begin on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods adoption of this update is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2012 we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations however we have used them in the past and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes 18 and 19 for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 

commodity price risk 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures forwards swaps and combinations of options as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk we also authorize the use of the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below lastin firstout inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts for crude oil refined products and ethanol 

we closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

  

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the table below sets forth information relating to our significant open commodity derivative contracts as of december 31 2012 

 

  

    sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2012 is provided in the following table 

 

 we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2012 would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations related to our debt obligations at december 31 2012 our debt was primarily comprised of the 30 billion fixed rate senior notes issued on february 1 2011 

  

sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint shift in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of december 31 2012 is provided in the following table 

 

  

    at december 31 2012 our portfolio of longterm debt was substantially comprised of fixedrate instruments therefore the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixedrate debt at prices above carrying value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2012 

counterparty risk 

we are also exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties or futures commission merchants we regularly review the creditworthiness of counterparties and futures commission merchants and enter into master netting agreements when appropriate 

forwardlooking statements 

these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forwardlooking statements with respect to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil other refinery feedstocks refined products and ethanol if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements

 item 1 business 

overview 

marathon petroleum corporation “mpc” was incorporated in delaware on november 9 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of marathon oil corporation “marathon oil” on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its refining marketing  transportation business “rmt business” into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil common stock in accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between marathon oil and mpc the distribution of mpc common stock was made on june 30 2011 with marathon oil stockholders receiving one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon oil common stock held the “spinoff” marathon oil received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spinoff qualifies as taxfree to marathon oil mpc and marathon oil stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a and related provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 following the spinoff marathon oil retained no ownership interest in mpc and each company had separate public ownership boards of directors and management a registration statement on form 10 as amended through the time of its effectiveness describing the spinoff was filed by mpc with the securities and exchange commission and was declared effective on june 6 2011 all subsidiaries and equity method investments not contributed by marathon oil to mpc remained with marathon oil on july 1 2011 our common stock began trading “regularway” on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

we are one of the largest petroleum product refiners marketers and transporters in the united states our operations consist of three business segments 

 

  

  

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8 for operating segment and geographic financial information which is incorporated herein by reference 

on december 1 2010 we completed the sale of most of our minnesota assets these assets included the 74000 barrelperday st paul park refinery and associated terminals 166 convenience stores primarily branded superamerica ® including six stores in wisconsin along with the supermom’s ® bakery a baked goods and sandwich supply operation and certain associated trademarks superamerica franchising llc interests in pipeline assets in minnesota and associated inventories we refer to these assets as the “minnesota assets” the operating statistics included in this section reflect the exclusion of these assets except as otherwise indicated see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 5 for additional information on the disposition of these assets 

  

our competitive strengths 

high quality asset base 

we believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the midwest and the fifth largest in the united states based on crude oil refining capacity we currently own a sixplant refinery network with approximately 12 million barrels per calendar day “mmbpcd” of crude oil throughput capacity our refineries process a wide range of crude oils including heavy and sour crude oils which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates as well as other refined products 

strategic location 

the geographic locations of our refineries and our extensive midstream distribution system provide us with strategic advantages located in petroleum administration for defense district “padd” ii and padd iii which consist of states in the midwest and the gulf coast regions of the united states our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources including domestic canadian and other foreign sources which provides us with flexibility to optimize supply costs for example geographic proximity to canadian crude oil supply sources allows our refineries to incur lower transportation costs than competitors transporting canadian crude oil to the gulf coast for refining our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access export markets and to serve a broad range of key enduser markets across the united states quickly and costeffectively 

 

attractive growth opportunities through internal projects 

we believe that we have attractive growth opportunities through internal capital projects in 2009 we completed a major expansion project at our garyville louisiana refinery which initially expanded the crude oil refining capacity of this refinery by 180 thousand barrels per calendar day “mbpcd” to 436 mbpcd we have continued 

  

to debottleneck the expanded refinery and have increased the crude oil refining capacity to 490 mbpcd as of december 31 2011 the garyville major expansion project has enhanced our scale efficiency our feedstock flexibility and access to global markets we are also continuing work on a 22 billion excluding capitalized interest heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit michigan refinery we expect construction will be completed in the third quarter of 2012 with full integration into the refinery by yearend 2012 the project will enable the refinery to process additional heavy sour crude oils including canadian bitumen blends which have traded at a steep discount to light sweet crude oil and is expected to increase the refinery’s crude oil refining capacity by approximately 15 thousand barrels per day “mbpd” 

extensive midstream distribution networks 

we believe the relative scale of our transportation and distribution assets and operations distinguishes us from other refining and marketing companies we currently own lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the united states on the basis of total volume delivered we also own one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the united states as well as trucking and rail assets we operate this system in coordination with our refining and marketing network which enables us to optimize feedstock and raw material supplies and refined product distribution this in turn results in economyofscale advantages that contribute to profitability 

competitively positioned marketing operations 

we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area we have two strong retail brands speedway ® and marathon ®  we believe our 1371 speedway ® convenience stores which we operate through a wholly owned subsidiary speedway llc comprise the fourth largest chain of companyowned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states and is available through more than 5000 retail outlets operated by jobbers and dealers in 18 states we believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost 

  

established track record of profitability and diversified income stream 

we have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the recent business cycle our historical net income in 2011 2010 and 2009 was 239 billion 623 million and 449 million respectively we believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results 

as shown in the following chart income from operations attributable to the speedway and pipeline transportation segments is less sensitive to business cycles while income from operations for the refining  marketing segment fluctuates to a greater degree 

 

our business strategies 

maintain investment grade credit profile 

as of december 31 2011 we had 308 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 30 billion in unused committed credit facilities we also had 331 billion of debt at yearend which represented only 26 percent of our total capitalization this strong balance sheet and liquidity position helped support our investmentgrade credit profile that we have had since the spinoff and continues to be a strategic objective as we go forward 

balance investments in the business with return of capital to stockholders 

a significant decision we make is how to use the cash that we generate to maximize stockholder value in october 2011 the board of directors authorized a 25 percent increase in the quarterly dividend and in february 2012 the repurchase of up to 20 billion of our common stock over the next two years we also seek to increase stockholder value by investing in acquisitions capital additions and other commercial opportunities 

pursue growth by expanding and upgrading existing asset base 

we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our existing asset base and consider capital projects that enhance our core competitiveness in the refining marketing and transportation businesses examples include our garyville refinery major expansion project completed in 2009 and our ongoing heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit michigan refinery we will continue to pursue other organic growth opportunities that provide an attractive return on capital 

  

increase profitability through margin improvement 

we intend to increase the profitability of our existing assets by pursuing a number of margin improvement opportunities including increasing our feedstock flexibility and our production of highvalue end products 

selectively pursue acquisitions 

we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions with the aim of increasing earnings while maintaining financial discipline for example our speedway segment completed the acquisition of 23 convenience stores in the chicago market in 2011 and we announced on february 9 2012 that speedway signed an agreement to acquire an additional 88 convenience stores throughout indiana and ohio from gasamerica services inc we intend to continue growing the speedway segment in part by acquisition 

evaluate strategic alternatives for midstream assets 

on february 1 2012 we announced that we are evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to certain of our midstream assets including but not limited to the possible formation and initial public offering of a master limited partnership “mlp” midstream assets are generally considered those involved in transportation storage and logistics operations if we determine to further pursue an initial public offering of an mlp we would not expect to file a registration statement before the end of the second quarter of 2012 

the above discussion contains forwardlooking statements with respect to our business strategies including our midstream asset evaluation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in whole or in part in pursuing our business strategies including whether our evaluation of our midstream assets will lead to an initial public offering of an mlp or any other transaction or that if any transaction is further pursued that it will be consummated some of the factors that could affect the midstream asset evaluation and the outcome of such evaluation include risks relating to securities markets generally the impact of adverse market conditions affecting our midstream business adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters and other risks 

refining  marketing 

we currently own and operate six refineries in the gulf coast and midwest regions of the united states with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 12 mmbpcd as of december 31 2011 during 2011 our refineries processed 1177 mbpd of crude oil and 181 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks during 2010 including the st paul park refinery until december 1 our refineries processed 1173 mbpd of crude oil and 162 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks the table below sets forth the location and crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries 

 

  

   

our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation fluid catalytic cracking catalytic reforming desulfurization and sulfur recovery units the refineries process a wide variety of crude oils and produce numerous refined products ranging from transportation fuels such as reformulated gasolines blendgrade gasolines intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ultralowsulfur diesel fuel to heavy fuel oil and asphalt additionally we manufacture aromatics propane propylene cumene and sulfur our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations produce higher margin products and utilize our processing capacity efficiently for example naphtha may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available also by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work 

garyville louisiana refinery  our garyville louisiana refinery is located along the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana between new orleans and baton rouge the garyville refinery is configured to process heavy sour crude oil into products such as gasoline distillates asphalt polymer grade propylene propane isobutane sulfur and fuelgrade coke an expansion project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 that increased garyville’s crude oil refining capacity making it one of the largest refineries in the us our garyville refinery has earned designation as a us occupational safety and health administration “osha” voluntary protection program “vpp” star site 

catlettsburg kentucky refinery  our catlettsburg kentucky refinery is located in northeastern kentucky on the western bank of the big sandy river near the confluence with the ohio river the catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline distillates asphalt cumene petrochemicals propane and propylene 

robinson illinois refinery  our robinson illinois refinery is located in southeastern illinois the robinson refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as multiple grades of gasoline distillates anodegrade coke propane butane and propylene the robinson refinery has earned designation as an osha vpp star site 

detroit michigan refinery  our detroit michigan refinery is located near interstate 75 in southwest detroit it is the only petroleum refinery currently operating in michigan the detroit refinery processes light sweet and heavy sour crude oils including canadian crude oils into products such as gasoline distillates asphalt slurry propane and propylene our detroit refinery earned designation as a michigan vpp star site in 2010 in 2007 we approved a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at this refinery with a current projected cost of 22 billion excluding capitalized interest this project will enable the refinery to process an additional 80 mbpd of heavy sour crude oils including canadian bitumen blends and will increase its total crude oil refining capacity by approximately 15 mbpd construction began in the first half of 2008 and overall progress reached 85 percent completion at december 31 2011 the project is expected to complete construction in the third quarter of 2012 with full integration into the refinery by yearend 2012 

canton ohio refinery  our canton ohio refinery is located approximately 60 miles southeast of cleveland ohio the canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline distillates asphalt propane slurry and roofing flux 

texas city texas refinery  our texas city texas refinery is located on the texas gulf coast approximately 30 miles south of houston texas the refinery processes sweet crude oil into products such as gasoline chemical grade propylene propane slurry and aromatics 

planned maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional detail 

  

the above discussion includes forwardlooking statements concerning the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project some factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics availability of materials and labor unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and thirdparty approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects 

refined product yields 

the following table sets forth our refinery production including the st paul park refinery until december 1 2010 by product group for each of the last three years 

 

 crude oil supply 

we obtain most of the crude oil we refine through negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market our crude oil supply contracts are generally term contracts with marketrelated pricing provisions the following table provides information on our sources of crude oil for each of the last three years including the st paul park refinery until december 1 2010 the crude oil sourced outside of north america was acquired from various foreign national oil companies production companies and trading companies 

 

 our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks and distribute our refined products through a variety of channels including pipelines trucks railcars ships and barges 

refined product marketing and distribution 

we believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our 17state market area in the midwest gulf coast and southeast regions of the united states independent retailers wholesale customers marathonbranded jobbers our speedway ® convenience stores airlines transportation companies and utilities comprise the core of our customer base in addition we sell distillates and asphalt for export to international customers primarily out of the garyville refinery sales destined for export comprised approximately 16 percent of our distillate sales and 11 percent of our asphalt sales in 2011 

  

the following table sets forth as a percentage of total refined product sales sales of refined products to our different customer types for the past three years including the minnesota assets until december 1 2010 

 

 the following table sets forth the approximate number of retail outlets by state where dealers and jobbers maintain marathonbranded retail outlets as of december 31 2011 

 

 the following table sets forth our refined products sales volumes by product group and our average sales price for each of the last three years including the minnesota assets until december 1 2010 

 

   

as of december 31 2011 we owned and operated 62 light product and 21 asphalt terminals in addition we distribute through approximately 52 thirdparty light product and 12 thirdparty asphalt terminals in our market area as of that date our marine transportation operations included 15 towboats as well as 167 owned and 14 leased barges that transport refined products on the ohio mississippi and illinois rivers and their tributaries as well as the intercoastal waterway we lease or own approximately 1950 railcars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of refined products in addition we own 124 transport trucks for the movement of refined products 

gasoline and distillates  we sell gasoline gasoline blendstocks and distillates including no 1 and no 2 fuel oils kerosene jet fuel and diesel fuel to wholesale customers marathonbranded jobbers and dealers and our speedway ® convenience stores in the midwest gulf coast and southeast regions of the united states and on the spot market in addition we sell diesel fuel for export to international customers we sold 56 percent of our gasoline sales volumes and 89 percent of our distillates sales volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2011 the demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months 

we have blended ethanol into gasoline for more than 20 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007 in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline including the minnesota assets until december 1 2010 were 70 mbpd in 2011 68 mbpd in 2010 and 60 mbpd in 2009 the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations we sell reformulated gasoline which is also blended with ethanol in parts of our marketing territory including chicago illinois louisville kentucky northern kentucky and milwaukee wisconsin we also sell biodieselblended diesel fuel in illinois kentucky north carolina florida georgia and pennsylvania 

we hold a 36 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110milliongallonperyear ethanol production facility in clymers indiana we also own a 50 percent interest in an entity which owns a 110milliongallonperyear ethanol production facility in greenville ohio both of these facilities are managed by a coowner 

propane  we produce propane at all six of our refineries propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers 

feedstocks and special products  we are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and specialty products product availability varies by refinery and includes propylene cumene dilute naphthalene oil molten sulfur toluene benzene and xylene we market all products domestically to customers in the chemical agricultural and fuel blending industries in addition we have the capacity to produce 1400 tons per calendar day of anodegrade coke at our robinson refinery which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry and 5800 tons per calendar day of fuelgrade coke at the garyville refinery which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications 

heavy fuel oil  we produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components at all six of our refineries heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering fuel industries though there are other more specialized uses of the product 

asphalt  we have refinerybased asphalt production capacity of up to 92 mbpcd we market asphalt through 33 owned or leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast we have a broad customer base including asphaltpaving contractors government entities states counties cities and townships and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers we sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail barge and vessel we also produce asphalt cements polymer modified asphalt emulsified asphalt and industrial asphalts 

  

speedway 

our speedway segment sells gasoline and merchandise through convenience stores that it owns and operates primarily under the speedway brand diesel fuel is also sold at the vast majority of these convenience stores speedwaybranded convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise such as prepared foods beverages and nonfood items including a number of privatelabel items speedy rewards™ an industryleading customer loyalty program has achieved significant customer engagement over the years since its introduction in 2004 the average monthly active membership in 2011 was more than 3 million customers 

as of december 31 2011 speedway had 1371 convenience stores in seven states revenues from sales of merchandise including sales from convenience stores we sold as part of the december 1 2010 sale of the minnesota assets totaled 292 billion in 2011 320 billion in 2010 and 311 billion in 2009 the demand for gasoline is seasonal with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel 

as of december 31 2011 the speedway segment’s convenience stores were located in the following states 

 

 harris interactive’s annual harris poll equitrend ® brand equity study named speedway the number one gasoline brand with consumers for each of the past three years for 2011 speedway was presented with a convenience retailing award from csp information group inc for consumer experience provided by the speedy rewards™ program 

pipeline transportation 

we own common carrier pipeline systems through marathon pipe line llc “mpl” and ohio river pipe line llc “orpl” both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries these pipeline systems transport crude oil and refined products primarily in the midwest and gulf coast regions to our refineries our terminals and other pipeline systems our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to state and federal energy regulatory commission regulations and guidelines including published tariffs for the transportation of crude oil and refined products our mpl and orpl wholly owned and undivided interest common carrier systems consist of 1707 miles of crude oil lines and 1825 miles of refined product lines comprising 31 systems located in 11 states as of december 31 2011 in addition mpl leases and operates 217 miles of common carrier refined product pipelines 

our major mpl owned and operated crude oil lines run from patoka illinois to catlettsburg kentucky patoka illinois to robinson illinois patoka illinois to lima ohio and samaria michigan to detroit michigan in addition mpl owns a 33 percent undivided joint interest in the capline system a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st james louisiana to patoka illinois and a 26 percent undivided joint interest in the maumee pipeline system a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from lima ohio to samaria michigan 

our major common carrier refined product pipelines include the owned and operated cardinal products pipeline and the wabash pipeline the cardinal products pipeline delivers refined products from kenova west virginia 

  

to columbus ohio the wabash pipeline system delivers refined products from robinson illinois to various terminals in the area of chicago illinois other significant refined product pipelines owned and operated by mpl extend from robinson illinois to louisville kentucky robinson illinois to lima ohio wood river illinois to indianapolis indiana garyville louisiana to zachary louisiana and texas city texas to pasadena texas 

the mpl common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the united states based on total volume delivered third parties generated 17 percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our mpl and orpl common carrier pipelines in 2011 our mpl and orpl common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years 

 

  

 as of december 31 2011 we had partial ownership interests in the following pipeline companies that have approximately 110 miles of crude oil pipelines and 3600 miles of refined products pipelines including about 970 miles operated by mpl 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we also own 175 miles of private crude oil pipelines 693 miles of private refined products pipelines and private storage facilities that are operated by mpl for the benefit of our refining  marketing segment on a cost recovery basis our major private crude oil lines run from lima ohio to canton ohio and st james louisiana to garyville louisiana our major private refined products pipelines run from robinson illinois to lima ohio martinsville illinois to indianapolis indiana and princeton indiana to robinson illinois in addition we own a 65 percent undivided joint interest in the louisvillelexington system a refined products pipeline system extending from louisville to lexington kentucky 

competition and market conditions 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products we compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of 

  

petroleum products based upon the “the oil  gas journal 2011 worldwide refinery survey” we ranked fifth among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity as of january 1 2012 we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale spot branded and retail distribution we believe we compete with about 70 companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers including privatebrand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers about 90 companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market 11 refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refinerbranded dealers and jobbers and approximately 240 retailers in the retail sale of refined products in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers we do not produce any of the crude oil we refine 

we also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their dealers and jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers often selling gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise at aggressively competitive prices nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into the retail transportation fuel business energy analysts international inc estimates such retailers had 12 percent of the us gasoline market in 2011 

our pipeline transportation operations are highly regulated which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 

market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil natural gas and refined products as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect our operating results 

demand for gasoline diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction as a result the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 

environmental matters 

our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for reviewing our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs we also have a crisis management team composed primarily of senior management that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations currently various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review discussion or implementation the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant for additional information see item 1a risk factors we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products we produce additionally we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective 

our operations are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these environmental laws and regulations include among others the clean air act with respect to air emissions the clean water act “cwa” with respect to water discharges the resource conservation and 

  

recovery act “rcra” with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa90” with respect to oil pollution and response in addition many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with similar matters new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with any new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate at this time in some cases existing environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup of a contaminated site on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them the ultimate cost of cleanup under such laws can be difficult to accurately predict in other cases the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations may not be clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or in some instances are undergoing revision these environmental laws and regulations particularly the 1990 amendments to the clean air act and its implementing regulations new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations could result in increased capital operating and compliance costs 

for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air water solid waste and remediation see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — environmental matters and compliance costs 

air 

we are subject to substantial requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations the us environmental protection agency “epa” issued an “endangerment finding” in 2009 to the effect that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution and endanger public health and welfare related to this endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emissions standard for mobile sources cars and light duty vehicles the endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard and epa’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act was expected to lead to widespread regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions as a result the epa issued a socalled “tailoring rule” to limit the applicability of the epa’s major permitting programs to larger sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as our refineries although legal challenges have been filed against these epa actions no court decisions are expected until sometime in 2012 the epa has also issued its plan for establishing specific greenhouse gas emission requirements under the clean air act under this plan the epa is expected to propose broad standards for refineries in early 2012 and is expected to issue final standards as soon as november 2012 congress may continue to consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions which may include a delay in the implementation of greenhouse gas regulations by the epa or a limitation on epa authority to regulate greenhouse gases although there may be an adverse financial impact including compliance costs potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for certain refined products made from crude oil associated with any legislation regulation or other action the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented private parties have sued various emitters of greenhouse gas emissions but we have not been named in any of those lawsuits privateparty litigation is also pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken 

of particular significance to our refining operations were epa mobile source air toxics ii “msat ii” regulations that require reduced benzene levels in refined products we have completed all msat ii projects and all msat ii compliance units were in operation as of december 31 2011 we spent approximately 620 million over a fouryear period that began in 2008 to comply with the msat ii regulations 

the epa is in the process of implementing regulations to address the national ambient air quality standards the “naaqs” for fine particulate emissions and ozone the epa has proposed and finalized rules directed at 

  

electric generating units but not refineries however a federal court has stayed some requirements and other requirements are expected to be finalized during 2012 we cannot reasonably estimate any final financial impact of these rules until the epa has finalized rules directed at refineries resolved legal challenges and the costs for implementation of the final rules have been evaluated 

the epa has reviewed and has revised or will propose to revise naaqs for criteria air pollutants the epa promulgated a revised ozone standard in march 2008 and commenced a multiyear process to develop the implementing rules required by the clean air act in 2009 the epa announced that it would reconsider the level of the ozone standard but then in 2011 it was announced that the ozone standard would not be further revised but would be further reviewed as part of epa’s next periodic review of that standard also in 2010 the epa adopted new short term standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide we anticipate the epa will issue a proposed revision to the fine particulate matter pm 25 standard in 2012 we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these revised naaqs standards until the standards are finalized implementing rules are established and judicial challenges over the revised naaqs standards are resolved 

the epa boiler and process heater maximum achievable control technology “boiler mact” rule was finalized in march 2011 with work practice standards that are applicable to refinery and natural gas fired equipment under the boiler mact rule we anticipate limited financial impacts from implementing the epa’s work practice standards for existing equipment by the march 23 2014 compliance deadline however the epa is currently reconsidering most provisions of this rule and on december 23 2011 the epa proposed additional revisions to the boiler mact rule as part of its reconsideration we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact of the boiler mact rule until after the reconsideration by the epa 

water 

we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts in addition we are regulated under opa90 which amended the cwa among other requirements opa90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances also in case of any such release opa90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages opa90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions 

additionally opa90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be doublehulled and that existing tank vessels that are not doublehulled be retrofitted or removed from us service according to a phaseout schedule all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the doublehulled requirements of opa90 we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa90 but with expanded liability provisions including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa90 and we have established spill prevention control and countermeasures “spcc” plans for facilities subject to cwa spcc requirements 

solid waste 

we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes besides affecting waste disposal practices rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks “usts” containing regulated substances we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite thirdparty treatment and disposal facilities ongoing rcrarelated costs however are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

  

remediation 

we own or operate or have owned or operated certain retail outlets where during the normal course of operations releases of refined products from usts have occurred federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states which administer their own ust programs our obligation to remediate such contamination varies depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our refinery terminal and pipeline locations penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance 

claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site liability is strict and can be joint and several because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site the complexity of determining the relative liability among them the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla however we do not believe such costs will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

mileage standards and renewable fuels requirements 

in 2007 the us congress passed the energy independence and security act “eisa” which among other things set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 and contains a second renewable fuel standard the “rfs2” the epa announced the final rfs2 regulations on february 4 2010 the rfs2 required 1395 billion gallons of renewable fuel usage in 2011 increasing to 360 billion gallons by 2022 in the near term the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline the rfs2 presents production and logistic challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining and marketing industries the rfs2 has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use within the overall 360 billion gallon rfs2 eisa established an advanced biofuel rfs2 volume of 135 billion gallons in 2011 and increases to 210 billion gallons by 2022 subsets within the advanced biofuel rfs2 include 080 billion gallons of biomassbased diesel in 2011 which is capped at 10 billion gallons starting in 2012 and 025 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel in 2011 increasing to 160 billion gallons by 2022 the epa determined that 025 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel would not be produced in 2011 and lowered the requirement to 66 million gallons in addition the requirement of 05 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel for 2012 will also not be produced and the epa has lowered the requirement to 865 million gallons the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels including biomassbased diesel and cellulosic biofuel with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels the advanced requirements for 2011 and 2012 require a substantial level of brazilian sugarcane ethanol imports since other sources of advanced renewable fuels are not available 

we have made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability in 2011 to be operational in 2012 to help comply with the biodiesel rfs2 requirement with physical blending as well as buying needed biodiesel renewable identification numbers “rins” in the epacreated biodiesel rins market 

on october 13 2010 the epa issued a partial waiver decision under the clean air act to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10 percent “e10” to 15 percent “e15” for 2007 and newer lightduty motor vehicles then on january 21 2011 the epa issued a second waiver for the use of e15 in vehicles model year 20012006 there are numerous issues including state and federal regulatory issues that would need to be addressed before e15 can be marketed for use in any traditional gasoline engines as of the end of 2011 e15 is still not a legal fuel except in flex fuel vehicles in states that do not require an astm international fuel 

  

there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in eisa and related regulations we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 

trademarks patents and licenses 

our marathon trademark is material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations and our speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail marketing operations we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole in general we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of knowhow rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations 

employees 

we had approximately 24210 regular employees as of december 31 2011 which includes approximately 16739 employees of speedway approximately 182 of these employees were working in the operations conducted through the minnesota assets which we sold in december 2010 approximately 2473 employees were transitioned to the buyer in 2011 primarily from speedway and the remaining 182 employees transitioned in january 2012 

certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg canton and texas city refineries are represented by the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that were due to expire in 2012 new labor agreements were negotiated in canton and texas city with expiration dates of january 2015 and march 2015 respectively the labor agreement in catlettsburg was temporarily extended while negotiations continue on a new agreement the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees at our detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is scheduled to expire in january 2014

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating us and our common stock some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate while others relate principally to our spinoff from marathon oil the ownership of our common stock and securities markets generally 

our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our industry and our business 

a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets 

our operating results cash flows future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products the measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil or crack spread is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins historically refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future our margins and cost of producing gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions including the price of crude oil we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions the overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins many of the factors influencing the change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longterm effects the longterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain 

  

we purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before refining and selling the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for sale to our customers price level changes during the periods between purchasing and selling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined product that we produce which may reduce our revenues operating income and cash flows significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets 

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce our profitability and refining and marketing gross margin 

the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies producing companies and trading companies including suppliers from the middle east these purchases are subject to political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world our overall profitability could be materially adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices that we do not recover in the marketplace refining and marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in various marketing areas the regulatory climate logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products our overall profitability could be materially adversely affected by factors that affect those margins such as rising refined product prices that we are not able to recover in the retail marketplace 

changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin 

various environmental safety health security marketing and pricing laws and regulations have imposed and are expected to continue to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin environmental laws and regulations in particular are subject to frequent change and many of them have become and will continue to become more stringent 

we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent of causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue with the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations currently various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of review discussion or implementation in the united states these include epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions these actions could result in increased 1 costs to operate and maintain our facilities 2 capital expenditures to install new emission controls on our facilities and 3 costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions regulations or carbon trading or tax programs although uncertain these developments could increase our costs reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 

increases in fuel mileage standards and renewable fuels mandates may reduce demand for refined products tax incentives and other subsidies have made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may have reduced and may further reduce refined product margins and their ability to compete with renewable fuels in 2007 the us congress passed the eisa which among other things sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020 and contains a second renewable fuel standard commonly referred to as rfs2 in december 2011 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly proposed regulations that would establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards as high as 496 miles per gallon by model year 2025 the 

  

rfs2 was 1395 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2011 and will increase to 360 billion gallons in 2022 in the near term the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline the rfs2 presents production and logistics challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining industries the rfs2 has required and may in the future continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use within the overall 360 billion gallon rfs2 the eisa established an advanced biofuel rfs2 volume of 135 billion gallons in 2011 and increases to 210 billion gallons in 2022 subsets within the advanced biofuel rfs2 include 008 billion gallons of biomassbased diesel in 2011 which is capped at 10 billion gallons beginning in 2012 and 025 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel in 2011 increasing to 160 billion gallons by 2022 the epa determined that 025 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel would not be produced in 2011 and has lowered the requirement to 66 million gallons the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels including biomassbased diesel and cellulosic biofuel with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in this law and related regulations we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 

our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of crude oil motor fuel and other substances for example we have been and presently are a defendant in a lawsuit involving products liability and other claims related to alleged contamination of groundwater with the gasoline oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” we may become involved in further litigation or other proceedings or we may be held responsible in existing or future litigation or proceedings the costs of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have in the past operated convenience stores with underground storage tanks “usts” in various jurisdictions and are currently operating convenience stores that have usts in numerous states in the united states federal and state regulations and legislation govern the usts and compliance with those requirements can be costly the operation of usts also poses certain other risks including damages associated with soil and groundwater contamination leaks from usts which may occur at one or more of our convenience stores or which may have occurred at our previously operated convenience stores may impact soil or groundwater and could result in substantial cleanup costs fines or civil liability for us the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other convenience stores in the future could result in significant additional costs 

we have in the past and will continue to dispose of various wastes at lawful disposal sites environmental laws including cercla and similar state laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 

if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain levels we could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to a variety of us federal statutes and regulations including the shipping act of 1916 as amended and the merchant marine act of 1920 as amended that govern the ownership and operation of certain vessels used to carry cargo between us ports which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws generally the maritime laws require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade and corporations operating such vessels must be owned by us citizens although our restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the maritime laws if we fail to maintain compliance we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters during any period in which we did not comply with these regulations such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities including the upgrading and expansion of our detroit refinery and improvements and repairs to our other facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects including the upgrading and expansion of our detroit refinery if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with and changes in environmental health safety and security laws and regulations and as a result our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our businesses are subject to numerous laws regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations to the extent these expenditures as is the case with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected the specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes we may also be required to make expenditures to modify operations install pollution control equipment perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new amended or more stringent requirements stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination in addition any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other sanctions and enforcement actions against us 

  

legislation or regulatory activity that impacts or could impact our operations includes among others 

 

  

  

 although there may be adverse financial impacts including compliance costs potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for certain refined products made from crude oil associated with any legislation regulation epa action or other action the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that various requirements have only recently been adopted and there exists present uncertainty regarding additional measures and how they may be implemented privateparty litigation has also been brought against various emitters of greenhouse gas emissions but we have not been named in any of those lawsuits private party litigation is also pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken 

worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products additionally these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

in addition a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in saudi arabia kuwait canada mexico and various other foreign countries we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from those areas if one or more of our supply sources were eliminated or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is 

  

possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our operations could be adversely affected including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs materially and adversely impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

actions of governments through tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business with foreign countries 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and feedstock supply and marketing refined products we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products in addition we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers we do not produce any of our crude oil supply many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their crude oil from their own exploration and production activities and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own exploration and production activities are at times able to offset losses from downstream operations with profits from upstream operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refined product margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have those competitors may have a greater ability to respond to volatile industry or market conditions such as shortages of crude oil or other feedstocks or intense price fluctuations 

we also face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline diesel and merchandise our competitors include service stations and convenience stores owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers and other wellrecognized national or regional retail outlets often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices several nontraditional retailers such as supermarkets club stores and mass merchants are in the retail fuel business these nontraditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow because of their diversity integration of operations experienced management and greater resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market in addition these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the pump and in the store to encourage instore merchandise sales these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts adversely affecting our profit margins additionally the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions fires pipeline ruptures or other interruptions crude oil or refined product spills severe weather and labor disputes for example some of our pipelines provide the almost exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to or refined products from some of our refineries and a prolonged interruption in service of any of these pipelines as a result of a pipeline rupture or due to any other reason could materially and adversely affect the operations profitability and cash flows of the connected refinery similar risks may apply to third parties who transport crude oil and refined products to from and among our facilities any prolonged 

unplanned interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial 

  

condition results of operations and cash flows our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us various hazards have adversely affected us in the past and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 

we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows historically we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities with significant selfinsured retentions in the future we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example due to hurricane activity in recent years the availability of insurance coverage for our facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced 

in addition our information technology systems and network infrastructure are subject to unauthorized access or attack which could result in the loss of sensitive business information systems interruptions or the disruption of our business operations to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans the level of protection and disaster recovery capability varies from site to site and there can be no guarantee that such plans to the extent they are in place will be totally effective 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil or refined product to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operating results are seasonal and generally are lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year 

demand for gasoline and diesel is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets due to seasonal increases in highway traffic as a result our operating results for the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each year 

we may incur losses as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future as well as derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate cap agreements given the impact a failure of a broker or counterparty to perform would have on the effectiveness of these transactions we also include broker and counterparty credit reviews as a part of our overall effectiveness assessment to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another broker or counterparty once a failure has occurred 

  

we have substantial debt obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile a decrease in debt capacity and unsecured commercial credit available to us or by factors adversely affecting the credit markets generally 

on february 1 2011 we completed the offering of 30 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes at december 31 2011 our total indebtedness for borrowed money and capital lease obligations was 331 billion we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 

our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 a decrease in overall debt and commercial credit capacity including unsecured credit extended by thirdparty suppliers or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

during the past three years the credit markets and the financial services industry experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government these circumstances and events led to reduced credit availability tighter lending standards and higher interest rates on loans while we cannot predict the future conditions of the credit markets future turmoil in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity financial condition and cash flows particularly if our ability to borrow money from lenders or access the capital markets to finance our operations were to be impaired 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely affect our performance 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse payroll franchise withholding and property taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits could subject us to interest and penalties 

litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities products liability consumer credit or privacy laws product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be 

  

expected to be material to us in some litigation the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities in addition to substantial liability plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 30 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the contract for the hourly workers at our catlettsburg refinery was due to expire in january 2012 it has been temporarily extended while negotiations continue on a new collective bargaining agreement the contracts for the hourly workers at our detroit canton and texas city refineries are scheduled to expire in january 2014 january 2015 and march 2015 respectively we cannot provide assurance that these contracts will not be renewed at an increased cost to us or that we will not experience work stoppages in the future as a result of labor disagreements 

risks relating to our spinoff from marathon oil 

our historical consolidated financial information does not necessarily reflect what our financial condition results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented 

the historical consolidated financial information we have included in this annual report on form 10k does not necessarily reflect what our financial condition results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during the periods prior to the spinoff from marathon oil this is primarily a result of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

   

we incurred significant costs to create the corporate infrastructure necessary to operate as an independent public company and we will continue to experience increased ongoing costs in connection with being an independent public company 

marathon oil performed many important corporate infrastructure functions for us prior to the spinoff on a cost allocation basis spread among all of the marathon oil businesses these functions included some information technology treasury tax administration accounting financial reporting human resources services incentive compensation legal and other services with completion of the spinoff we established our own corporate infrastructure which resulted in the incurrence of significant costs the ongoing costs associated with maintaining a corporate infrastructure as an independent public company and performing these services may significantly exceed the amounts reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil following the spinoff 

although the spinoff has occurred there are several significant areas where liabilities of marathon oil may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil however if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

if the spinoff were ultimately determined not to qualify as a taxfree transaction marathon oil and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify marathon oil for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

marathon oil received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spinoff qualifies as taxfree to marathon oil us and marathon oil stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a and related provisions of the code if the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect then marathon oil would not be able to continue to rely on the ruling furthermore the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spinoff satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code rather the private letter ruling is based on representations by marathon oil that those requirements have been satisfied and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling 

we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations that were relied on in the private letter ruling to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect if notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling the spinoff were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code marathon oil would be subject to tax as if it had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares 

with respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed on marathon oil in connection with the spinoff and certain related transactions as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences as set forth in the private letter ruling under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with marathon oil we will be liable to marathon oil for any such taxes or liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us any of our affiliates or any person that after the spinoff is our affiliate we may 

  

be similarly liable if we breach specified representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement if we are required to indemnify marathon oil for taxes incurred as a result of the spinoff or certain related transactions being taxable to marathon oil it would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

potential liabilities associated with certain assumed obligations under the tax sharing agreement cannot be precisely quantified at this time 

under the tax sharing agreement we entered into with marathon oil following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries whether accruing before on or after the spinoff we also agreed to be responsible for and indemnify marathon oil with respect to all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff or certain internal restructuring transactions failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368a and 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes which could result for example from a merger or other transaction involving an acquisition of our stock to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation warranty covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement as described above such tax liability would be calculated as though marathon oil or its affiliate had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value and marathon oil or its affiliate would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares in addition we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified taxrelated liabilities associated with the 2005 transaction in which we acquired the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited in amount or subject to any cap if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities at this time we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts the tax liabilities described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our company 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital raising transactions for two years following the spinoff in addition under some circumstances we could be liable for any adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital raising transactions 

even if the spinoff’s status as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code remains intact the spinoff may result in significant us federal income tax liabilities to marathon oil under applicable provisions of the code if 50 or more of marathon oil’s stock or our stock in each case by vote or value is treated as having been acquired directly or indirectly by one or more persons as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spinoff under those provisions any acquisitions of marathon oil stock or our stock or similar acquisitions or any understanding arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding an acquisition of marathon oil stock or our stock or similar acquisitions within two years before or after the spinoff are subject to special scrutiny the process for determining whether an acquisition triggering those provisions has occurred is complex inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case if a direct or indirect acquisition of marathon oil stock or our stock resulted in a change in control as contemplated by those provisions marathon oil but not its stockholders would recognize taxable gain 

under the tax sharing agreement there are restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the separation to fail to qualify as a taxfree distribution and we are required to indemnify marathon oil against any such tax liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us or any of our affiliates or any person that after the spinoff is our affiliate we may be similarly liable if we breach certain other representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement we are also subject to restrictions on our ability to issue shares of our stock without satisfying certain conditions within the tax sharing agreement as a result of the foregoing we may be unable to engage in strategic or capital raising transactions that our stockholders might consider favorable or to structure potential transactions in the manner most favorable to us without adverse tax consequences if at all 

  

potential indemnification liabilities to marathon oil pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions that were required to effect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff as well as those obligations of marathon oil assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities 

in connection with our separation from marathon oil marathon oil will indemnify us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that marathon oil’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement marathon oil agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that marathon oil agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves if marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally marathon oil’s insurers may deny coverage to us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from such insurance providers we may be required to temporarily bear such denial of coverage 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly 

the market price and trading volume of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 

the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law generally could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable these include provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may have an antitakeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock 

we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders 

  

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation that limit ownership of our capital stock by nonus citizens may adversely affect the liquidity of our capital stock 

to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by nonus citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 of the outstanding shares we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by nonus citizens to exceed 23 our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to nonus citizens due to the limitations on ownership by nonus citizens any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock 

we may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock 

our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock

in may 2007 the kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against us and marathon oil in state court in franklin county kentucky for alleged violations of kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws following hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 the lawsuit alleges that we overcharged customers by 89 million during september and october 2005 the complaint seeks disgorgement of these sums as well as penalties under kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws we are vigorously defending this litigation if the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we believe that this is the first lawsuit for damages and injunctive relief under the kentucky emergency pricing laws to progress this far and it contains many novel issues in may 2011 the kentucky attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in april and may 2011 under statewide price controls that were activated by the kentucky governor on april 26 2011 and which have since expired the court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief and the remainder of the 2011 claims likely will be resolved along with those dating from 2005 the ultimate outcome of the 2007 lawsuit including the claims related to our 2011 pricing and any financial effect on us remains uncertain management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made for this lawsuit at this time 

mtbe litigation 

during 2011 we were a defendant along with other refining and marketing companies in eight lawsuits pending in six states in which a total of fourteen plaintiffs sought to recover damages alleged to have resulted from mtbe contamination in groundwater we along with other refining and marketing companies settled a number of lawsuits pertaining to mtbe in 2008 we settled additional mtberelated lawsuits in 2009 and 2010 in 2011 we agreed to and subsequently paid a nonmaterial amount to settle seven of the pending lawsuits and similar claims by three additional parties that did not file lawsuits in settling these lawsuits and claims and the previous lawsuits we did not admit liability we remain a defendant in one mtberelated lawsuit pending in a multidistrict litigation in the southern district of new york for pretrial proceedings where the new jersey 

  

department of environmental protection seeks to recover the cost of remediating mtbe contamination of ground and surface water not being used for public water supply purposes as well as natural resources damages allegedly resulting from such contamination we are vigorously defending this pending lawsuit based upon our experience and amounts paid in connection with the settlement of other mtbe lawsuits we do not expect our share of liability for this lawsuit or any future mtbe lawsuits to materially impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however the ultimate outcome of the pending or future mtbe lawsuits including any financial effect on us remains uncertain we voluntarily discontinued distributing gasoline containing mtbe in at the latest 2002 

we are a defendant in a number of other lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business while the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these other lawsuits and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental proceedings 

the following is a summary of certain environmental proceedings involving us that were pending or contemplated as of december 31 2011 under federal and state environmental laws 

we have been in discussions with the epa to proactively enter into a consent decree regarding the operation of our flares at our six refineries in order to minimize flare emissions once finalized the consent decree will likely include a civil penalty in excess of 100000 

during 2001 we entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act and other violations with the epa covering all of our refineries the settlement committed us to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to our refineries which are now complete we are working with the epa to terminate the new source review consent decree 

in september 2011 marathon petroleum company lp received an enforcement notice from the michigan department of environmental quality the “mdeq” regarding a product release at a facility in stockbridge michigan in the enforcement notice mdeq alleges certain environmental violations involving michigan’s water protection laws but does not propose a civil penalty amount however it is possible that the mdeq could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with the release 

in january 2011 the epa notified us of 18 alleged violations of various statutory and regulatory provisions related to motor fuels some of which we had previously selfreported to the epa no formal enforcement action has been commenced and no demand for penalties has been asserted by the epa in connection with these alleged violations however it is possible that the epa could seek penalties in excess of 100000 in connection with one or more of the alleged violations 

on october 3 2011 we received a revised stipulation agreement from the minnesota pollution control agency “mpca” the mpca alleged six violations of environmental law including whether we stored treated and disposed of hazardous waste in a lagoon without a permit in november 2011 we executed the stipulation agreement and paid a civil penalty of 700000 on january 3 2012 the mpca acknowledged that we have fulfilled the requirements of the stipulation agreement and officially terminated the agreement 

we have been subject to a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency and the illinois attorney general’s office since 2002 concerning selfreporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at the robinson illinois refinery there were no significant developments in this matter in 2011 

on november 7 2011 the epa issued marathon petroleum company lp a notice of violation “nov” alleging violations of the renewable fuel standard “rfs” regulations specifically the nov alleged violations 

  

related to the use of invalid rins to meet our renewable volume obligation under the rfs regulations the resolution of this matter may result in a penalty in excess of 100000 

we are involved in a number of other environmental enforcement matters arising in the ordinary course of business while the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of each of these other matters is not likely to result in a penalty in excess of 100000 and that collectively the environmental proceedings described above and these other environmental enforcement matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

administrative proceedings 

the us department of transportation pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” issued a notice of probable violation proposed civil penalty and proposed compliance order to mpl related to a march 10 2009 incident at st james louisiana the nopv included a proposed civil penalty of approximately 1 million negotiations between phmsa and mpl continue in an effort to resolve this matter

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes various forwardlooking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business you can identify our forwardlooking statements by words such as “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “plan” “predict” “project” “seek” “target” “could” “may” “should” or “would” or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes in accordance with “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors though not necessarily all such factors which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forwardlooking statements 

the spinoff and basis of presentation 

on may 25 2011 the marathon oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its rmt business into an independent publicly traded company mpc through the distribution of mpc common stock to the stockholders of marathon oil common stock in accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between marathon oil and mpc the distribution of mpc common stock was made on june 30 2011 with marathon oil stockholders receiving one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon oil common stock marathon oil received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spinoff qualifies as taxfree to marathon oil mpc and marathon oil stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a and related provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 following the spinoff marathon oil retained no ownership interest in mpc and each company had separate public ownership boards of directors and management on july 1 2011 our common stock began trading “regularway” on the nyse under the ticker symbol “mpc” 

prior to the spinoff on june 30 2011 our financial position results of operations and cash flows consisted of the rmt business which represented a combined reporting entity subsequent to the spinoff our financial position results of operations and cash flows consist of consolidated mpc activities and balances the assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements have been reflected on a historical basis as immediately prior to the spinoff all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by marathon oil and were transferred within the marathon oil consolidated group all significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated the consolidated statements of income for periods prior to the spinoff include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by marathon oil including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight accounting treasury tax legal procurement and information technology those allocations were based primarily on specific identification headcount or computer utilization our management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from marathon oil are reasonable however the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a standalone company during those periods presented prior to the spinoff and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows had we been a standalone company during the periods presented actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure subsequent to the spinoff we are performing these functions using internal resources or services provided by third parties certain of which are being provided by marathon oil during a transition period pursuant to a transition services agreement 

  

corporate overview 

we are an independent petroleum refining marketing and transportation company we currently own and operate six refineries all located in the united states with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 12 mmbpcd our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas including the midwest gulf coast and southeast regions of the united states we distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and a combination of mpcowned and thirdpartyowned trucking and rail assets we currently own lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the united states on the basis of total volumes delivered 

our operations consist of three reportable operating segments refining  marketing speedway and pipeline transportation each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer see item 1 business for additional information on our segments 

 

  

  

 on december 1 2010 we completed the sale of the minnesota assets these assets included the 74000 barrel per day st paul park refinery and associated terminals 166 convenience stores primarily branded superamerica ® including six stores in wisconsin along with the supermom’s bakery and commissary a baked goods and sandwich supply operation and certain associated trademarks superamerica franchising llc interests in pipeline assets in minnesota and associated inventories our results of operations financial position cash flows and operating statistics for all periods prior to the disposition include amounts for the minnesota assets 

we reported net income of 239 billion or 667 per diluted share for 2011 compared to net income of 623 million or 174 per diluted share for 2010 the increase was primarily due to our refining  marketing segment operations which generated income from operations of 359 billion in 2011 compared to 800 million in 2010 the increase in refining  marketing segment income from operations was due to an improved refining and marketing gross margin which was primarily a result of wider differentials between west texas intermediate crude oil “wti” and other light sweet crudes such as light louisiana sweet crude oil “lls” larger lls 6321 crack spreads and wider sweetsour differentials 

the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project continues to be a significant part of our capital spending as of december 31 2011 the project was approximately 85 percent complete and on schedule to complete construction in the third quarter of 2012 immediately following the completion of construction there will be a 70day turnaround with the expanded detroit refinery anticipated to be online by year end in addition 

  

we continued to optimize our other refineries in 2011 with increases in our crude oil refining capacity as of december 31 2011 at our garyville refinery from 464 mbpcd to 490 mbpcd at our catlettsburg refinery from 212 mbpcd to 233 mbpcd and at our texas city refinery from 76 mbpcd to 80 mbpcd 

our speedway segment generated income from operations of 271 million for 2011 compared to income from operations of 293 million for 2010 increases in light product and merchandise margins were more than offset by the decrease in income attributed to the sale of 166 convenience stores that were part of the minnesota assets disposition in december 2010 

in 2011 speedway purchased 23 convenience stores in illinois and indiana all of the locations have been rebranded and are now integrated into speedway’s operations we intend to grow our speedway segment through a combination of new construction and selective acquisitions 

our pipeline transportation segment continued to generate steady income with income from operations of 199 million for 2011 compared to income from operations of 183 million for 2010 

as a result of the spinoff we issued 30 billion of senior notes in february 2011 we used a portion of the proceeds to repay our longterm debt payable to marathon oil as additional sources of liquidity during 2011 we entered into a fouryear revolving credit agreement with an initial borrowing capacity of 20 billion and a threeyear trade receivables securitization facility with an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 10 billion as of december 31 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of 308 billion and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under either the revolving credit agreement or the trade receivables securitization facility 

the above discussion includes forwardlooking statements with respect to the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project and speedway segment growth factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements include transportation logistics availability of materials and labor unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and thirdparty approvals other risks customarily associated with construction projects and our ability to successfully implement growth opportunities these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

overview of segments 

refining  marketing 

refining  marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining and marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs 

our refining and marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses including depreciation and amortization the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin crack spreads can fluctuate significantly particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants we calculate midwest chicago and us gulf coast “usgc” crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products lls prices and a 6321 ratio of products 6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline 2 barrels of ultralow sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent sulfur residual fuel are used for these crackspread calculations 

our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil the amount of this discount the sweetsour differential can vary significantly causing our refining and marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude in general a larger sweetsour differential will enhance our refining and marketing gross margin 

  

historically wti has traded at prices similar to lls during 2011 wti traded at prices significantly less than lls which favorably impacted our refining and marketing gross margin 

the following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in net income due to potential changes in market conditions 

 

  

   in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads the sweetsour differential and the discount of wti to lls our refining and marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as 

 

  

  

  

  

 changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries and the level of maintenance costs planned major maintenance activities or turnarounds requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years 

 

 the table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at december 31 of each year 

 

  

   

speedway 

our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products including transportation and consumer excise taxes and the cost of bankcard processing fees impacts the speedway segment profitability numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year including local competition seasonal demand fluctuations the available wholesale supply the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions the demand for gasoline in the midwest region of the us is estimated to have declined more than two percent in 2011 associated with higher prices following essentially flat demand during 2010 and 2009 after decreasing in 2009 distillate demand in the midwest region of the us increased in 2010 higher prices contributed to an estimated one percent decrease in distillate demand in 2011 market demand increases for gasoline and distillates generally increase the product margin we can realize the gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile 

pipeline transportation 

the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining  marketing segment the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of and refiner demand for crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of and user demand for refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines in most of our markets demand for gasoline and distillates peaks during the summer driving season which extends from may through september of each year and declines during the fall and winter months as with crude oil other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements 

  

results of operations 

years ended december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

consolidated results of operations 

 

 consolidated net income was 177 billion higher in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin which increased to 775 per barrel in 2011 from 281 per barrel in 2010 

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes increased 1620 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher refined product selling prices 

sales to related parties decreased 45 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease resulted from sales to marathon oil after the spinoff no longer being classified as related party and lower refined product volumes sold to centennial partially offset by higher refined product selling prices 

income from equity method investments decreased 20 million from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to 12 million of increased losses from our investment in centennial centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 compared to the corresponding period of 2010 also 2010 included 4 million of income from an investment in a pipeline company that was included in the minnesota assets disposition 

other income increased 22 million in 2011 compared with 2010 due primarily to income from transition services provided to the purchaser of the minnesota assets and to marathon oil 

cost of revenues increased 1406 billion in 2011 from 2010 the increase was primarily the result of higher acquisition costs of crude oil refinery charge and blendstocks and refined products in the refining  marketing segment largely due to higher market prices crude oil acquisition prices were up 31 percent charge and blendstock prices were up 28 percent and purchased refined product prices were up 40 percent 

  

purchases from related parties decreased 677 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease was primarily due to purchases of crude oil from marathon oil after the spinoff not being classified as related party transactions 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 186 million in 2011 compared with 2010 employee compensation and benefits expenses comprised 81 million of the increase which is partially due to an increase in the number of administrative employees associated with being a standalone public company higher incentive compensation accruals related to 2011 performance and increased pension and postretirement benefit costs contract services expenses increased 62 million primarily due to higher information technology costs associated with being a separate standalone company in addition bankcard processing fees related to marathon brand sales increased 41 million primarily due to higher transportation fuel selling prices following the spinoff we no longer receive allocated corporate overhead costs from marathon oil 

related party net interest and other financial income increased 11 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflecting higher average balances of our shortterm investments in preferred stock of moc portfolio delaware inc “pfd” a subsidiary of marathon oil prior to the spinoff the agreement with pfd was terminated on june 30 2011 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 for further discussion of the pfd preferred stock 

net interest and other financial costs increased 49 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the 30 billion of longterm debt we issued in february 2011 we capitalized thirdparty interest of 104 million in 2011 compared to 17 million in 2010 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 18 for further details relating to our debt 

provision for income taxes increased 930 million from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to the 270 billion increase in income before income taxes the effective income tax rate decreased from 39 percent in 2010 to 36 percent in 2011 the 2011 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by an increase in income qualifying for the domestic manufacturing deduction and a decrease in the effective tax rate for state taxes the year 2011 included a 19 million adverse tax impact of state legislative changes primarily in michigan and 2010 included a 26 million adverse tax impact of federal legislative changes the provision for income taxes for periods prior to the spinoff has been computed as if we were a standalone company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 11 for further details 

segment results 

revenues are summarized by segment in the following table 

 

   

refining  marketing segment revenues increased 1605 billion in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increased refined product selling prices our average refined product selling prices were 293 per gallon in 2011 compared to 224 per gallon in 2010 the table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas 

 

 refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment were 830 billion in 2011 compared to 739 billion in 2010 intersegment refined product sales volumes were 266 billion gallons in 2011 compared to 311 billion gallons in 2010 with the decreased volumes primarily due to the minnesota assets disposition 

speedway segment revenues increased 996 million from 2010 to 2011 mainly due to higher gasoline and distillate selling prices which averaged 344 per gallon in 2011 compared to 270 per gallon in 2010 these impacts were partially offset by decreased gasoline and distillate sales volumes and lower merchandise sales primarily due to the minnesota assets disposition in december 2010 

income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table 

 

  

   the following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining  marketing segment’s business 

 

  

      

refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 279 billion in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin per barrel which averaged 775 per barrel in 2011 compared to 281 per barrel in 2010 our realized refining and marketing gross margin for 2011 improved from 2010 primarily due to wider differentials between wti and other light sweet crudes such as lls larger lls 6321 crack spreads and wider sweetsour differentials the discount of wti to lls increased 1404 per barrel as a result of logistical constraints in the us midcontinent markets which prevented the price of wti from rising with the prices of crudes produced in other regions we estimate this had a 169 billion positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin the chicago and usgc lls 6321 crack spreads increased 079 per barrel and 071 per barrel respectively and we estimate this had a 349 million positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin the sweetsour differential widened 154 per barrel and we estimate this had a 277 million positive impact on our refining and marketing gross margin within our refining system sour crude accounted for 52 percent and 54 percent of our crude oil processed in 2011 and 2010 respectively direct operating costs declined 248 million from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to a 188 million reduction in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs which also contributed to the increase in gross margin 

our total refinery throughputs of 1358 mbpd were two percent higher in 2011 compared to 2010 which included throughputs at our former st paul park refinery the increased throughputs in 2011 were the result of improved refinery utilization and decreased turnaround activity compared to 2010 primarily at our garyville refinery crude oil refined was essentially flat in 2011 compared to 2010 while other charge and blendstock throughputs increased 12 percent over the same period 

the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the refining  marketing segment for 2011 and 2010 

 

  

    speedway segment income from operations decreased 22 million from 2010 to 2011 with 45 million attributable to the sale of 166 convenience stores that were part of the minnesota assets disposition in december 2010 and 33 million attributable to increased operating expenses partially due to higher employee costs these decreases were partially offset by a 30 million increase associated with a higher gasoline and distillate gross margin and a 26 million increase associated with a higher merchandise gross margin speedway’s gasoline and distillate gross margin per gallon averaged 1308 cents in 2011 compared with 1207 cents in 2010 gasoline and distillate sales volumes declined in 2011 primarily reflecting the sale of the minnesota assets merchandise gross margin was 719 million in 2011 compared to 789 million in 2010 also reflecting the minnesota assets disposition 

samestore gasoline sales volume decreased 17 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 while samestore merchandise sales increased 11 percent for the same period the primary factor affecting same store gasoline sales volume was the higher average retail price of gasoline 

  

pipeline transportation segment income from operations increased 16 million in 2011 from 2010 the increase primarily reflects the absence of nonroutine maintenance and impairment expenses incurred in 2010 partially offset by a reduction in income from pipeline equity method investments refined product trunk line volumes increased seven percent in 2011 compared to 2010 while crude oil trunk line volumes decreased two percent in the same period 

corporate and other unallocated items increased 80 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher information technology employee benefits and other administrative expenses partially resulting from costs associated with being a standalone company following the spinoff we no longer receive allocated corporate overhead costs from marathon oil 

impairment expense in 2010 was a 29 million property impairment related to a maleic anhydride plant which was operated by our refining  marketing segment 

years ended december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 

consolidated results of operations 

 

   

consolidated net income was 174 million higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin which increased to 281 per barrel in 2010 from 242 per barrel in 2009 

sales and other operating revenues including consumer excise taxes increased by 1693 billion in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to higher refined product selling prices 

income from equity method investments increased 40 million in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher earnings from our investments in crude oil pipeline companies which increased approximately 22 million and ethanol production facilities which increased approximately 10 million 

cost of revenues increased 1468 billion in 2010 from 2009 the increase was primarily the result of higher acquisition costs for crude oil charge and blendstocks and purchased refined products in the refining  marketing segment largely due to higher market prices crude oil acquisition prices increased 26 percent charge and blendstock prices increased 30 percent and purchased refined product prices increased 19 percent these pricerelated impacts accounted for approximately 868 billion of the total increase volumes of purchased crude oil were 20 percent higher which also contributed to increased costs of approximately 422 billion primarily reflecting impacts of the garyville major expansion project 

purchases from related parties increased 128 billion from 2009 to 2010 primarily reflecting both higher acquisition costs of crude oil from marathon oil and increased volumes higher crude oil volumes accounted for approximately 630 million of the increase and higher crude prices accounted for about 600 million of the increase 

depreciation and amortization increased 271 million in 2010 from 2009 primarily related to the garyville major expansion project which we completed near the end of 2009 

related party net interest and other financial income decreased 21 million in 2010 from 2009 primarily reflecting lower average balances of shortterm investments in pfd preferred stock see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 for further discussion of the pfd preferred stock 

provision for income taxes increased 164 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to the 338 million increase in income before income taxes and a 26 million expense for legislative changes which are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 11 the effective income tax rate increased from 34 percent in 2009 to 39 percent in 2010 primarily due to legislative changes and a decrease in the effect of deductions for dividends received from a related party the provision for income taxes was computed as if we were a standalone company 

segment results 

revenues are summarized by segment in the following table 

 

   

refining  marketing segment revenues increased 1667 billion in 2010 from 2009 consistent with relative price level changes our average refined product selling prices were 224 per gallon in 2010 as compared to 186 per gallon in 2009 with the higher prices in 2010 contributing about 55 percent of the increase in segment revenues in addition refined product sales volumes increased 15 percent in 2010 in part due to the higher production from our garyville refinery following the completion of the major expansion project contributing about 35 percent of the segment revenue increase the table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas 

 

 refining  marketing intersegment sales to our speedway segment were 739 billion in 2010 as compared to 602 billion in 2009 intersegment refined product sales volumes were 311 billion gallons in 2010 as compared to 303 billion gallons in 2009 

speedway segment revenues increased 166 billion from 2009 to 2010 mainly due to higher gasoline and distillate prices which increased nearly 20 percent and accounted for approximately 140 billion of the increase in segment revenues

 refining  marketing segment income from operations increased 348 million in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to a higher refining and marketing gross margin per barrel which averaged 281 per barrel in 2010 compared to 242 per barrel in 2009 and accounted for approximately 240 million of the increase in segment income the gross margin increase was primarily a result of a 185 per barrel widening of the sweetsour differential thereby decreasing the relative cost of crude processed by our refineries we estimate that the widening of the sweetsour differential positively impacted our refining and marketing gross margin by 766 million within our refining system sour crude accounted for 54 percent and 50 percent of our crude oil processed in 2010 and 2009 respectively these favorable impacts to the refining and marketing gross margin were partially offset by lower lls 6321 crack spreads in 2010 compared to 2009 and increased manufacturing costs incurred related to the additional units at the garyville refinery 

also contributing to the increase in segment income from operations were increases in our refined product sales volumes due primarily to increased refinery production which accounted for approximately 185 million of the increase in segment income we averaged 1173 mbpd of crude oil throughput in 2010 and 957 mbpd in 2009 total refinery throughputs averaged 1335 mbpd in 2010 and 1153 mbpd in 2009 these throughputs were higher in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to the garyville major expansion slightly offset by the reduction caused by the sale of the st paul park refinery effective december 1 2010 

the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the refining  marketing segment for 2010 and 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

   

speedway segment income from operations increased 81 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to a higher gasoline and distillates gross margin which averaged 1207 cents per gallon in 2010 compared to 1030 cents per gallon in 2009 

samestore gasoline sales volume increased 30 percent compared to 2009 while samestore merchandise sales increased by 44 percent for the same period 

pipeline transportation segment income from operations increased 11 million in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher earnings from our equity method investments in crude oil pipeline companies this was partially offset by increased depreciation expense primarily reflecting an impairment charge for the 2010 cancellation of a pipeline project associated with the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project and the impact of pipeline assets associated with the garyville major expansion project which were placed in service near the end of 2009 

corporate and other unallocated items reflected an increase in expenses of 64 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to higher benefitsrelated costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

net cash provided from operating activities totaled 331 billion in 2011 compared to 222 billion in 2010 and 246 billion in 2009 the 109 billion increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher net income in 2011 partially offset by changes in working capital changes in working capital were a net 13 million source of cash in 2011 compared to a net 318 million source of cash in 2010 primarily due to the impact of higher crude oil and refined product prices on accounts payable and accounts receivable at yearend 2011 compared to yearend 2010 and higher inventory volumes at december 31 2011 the 238 million decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was mainly due to a smaller cash source from working capital changes primarily reflecting the impact of higher crude oil and refined product prices on accounts payable and accounts receivable at yearend 2010 as compared to yearend 2009 

net cash provided by investing activities totaled 130 billion in 2011 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 215 billion in 2010 and 264 billion in 2009 the 345 billion change in 2011 from 2010 was primarily due to net redemptions of related party debt securities in 2011 as further discussed below the favorable 499 million change in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to decreased capital spending resulting from completion of our garyville major expansion project at the end of 2009 and increased cash received from asset disposals partially offset by net purchases of related party debt securities in 2010 

the consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash a reconciliation of additions to property plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years 

 

  

   

capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below 

 

  

  

 the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project comprised 59 percent 50 percent and 14 percent excluding capitalized interest associated with this project of our refining  marketing segment capital spending in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively as of december 31 2011 the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project was approximately 85 percent complete and on schedule to complete construction in the third quarter of 2012 

the above discussion includes forwardlooking statements with respect to the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project factors that could affect the project include transportation logistics availability of materials and labor unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and thirdparty approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements 

the garyville major expansion project was a major component of our 2009 spending accounting for approximately 64 percent excluding capitalized interest associated with this project of our refining  marketing segment’s capital spending in 2009 

the 74 million cash used in acquisitions in 2011 resulted from our speedway segment’s purchase of 23 convenience stores in illinois and indiana 

disposal of assets totaled 144 million 763 million and 53 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the 144 million of cash from asset disposals in 2011 primarily included the collection of a receivable associated with the sale of the minnesota assets in 2010 disposal of assets primarily included proceeds from the sale of the minnesota assets 

net investments in related party debt securities was a source of cash of 240 billion in 2011 a use of cash of 169 billion in 2010 and a source of cash of 160 million in 2009 all such activity reflected the net cash flow from redemptions and purchases of pfd preferred stock prior to the spinoff all investments in pfd preferred stock were redeemed and the agreement with pfd was terminated see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 for further discussion of our investments in pfd preferred stock 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 164 billion in 2011 compared with cash used in financing activities of 82 million in 2010 and cash provided by financing activities of 209 million in 2009 the use of cash in 2011 was primarily due to the net repayment of debt payable to marathon oil and its subsidiaries and net distributions to marathon oil partially offset by cash provided from the issuance of longterm debt these activities were undertaken to effect the spinoff the year 2011 also included a use of cash of 60 million for debt issuance costs associated with the 30 billion of senior notes our 20 billion revolving credit facility and our 10 billion trade receivables securitization facility see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 18 for additional information on our longterm debt 

  

net borrowings and repayments under our longterm debt payable to marathon oil and its subsidiaries was a use of cash of 362 billion in 2011 compared with sources of cash of 126 billion in 2010 and 15 million in 2009 the agreements with marathon oil and its subsidiaries were terminated in 2011 in 2010 net borrowings included 126 billion under the revolving credit agreement with pfd see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 for further discussion of these financing agreements 

contributions from distributions to marathon oil totaled net distributions of 783 million in 2011 and 133 billion in 2010 and a net contribution of 207 million in 2009 the net distribution in 2011 was primarily related to 147 billion in net cash distributions paid to marathon oil partially offset by income taxes it incurred on our behalf the net distribution in 2010 was primarily related to 148 billion in cash distributions paid to marathon oil the net contribution in 2009 was primarily capitalized interest and corporate overhead cost allocations incurred by marathon oil on our behalf 

in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement between marathon oil and us relating to the spinoff marathon oil determined that our cash and cash equivalents balance as of june 30 2011 should be approximately 1625 billion our actual cash and cash equivalents balance as of june 30 2011 was 1622 billion and it increased to 308 billion at december 31 2011 due to the factors discussed above 

derivative instruments 

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk 

capital resources 

as of december 31 2011 our liquidity totaled 608 billion consisting of 

 

 because of the alternatives available to us including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm and longterm funding requirements including capital spending programs the repurchase of shares of our common stock dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies 

on february 1 2011 we completed a private placement of 30 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes collectively the “notes” consisting of 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 3 1  2  senior notes due march 1 2016 10 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5 18 senior notes due march 1 2021 and 125 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6 1  2  senior notes due march 1 2041 on november 18 2011 we completed a registered exchange offer for the notes interest on each series of notes is payable semiannually on march 1 and september 1 of each year 

  

the indenture governing the notes includes covenants that among other things limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt secured by mortgages and other liens with respect to principal properties enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal properties and merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell or convey all or substantially all of our assets these covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and limitations as set forth in the indenture in addition if we experience a “change of control repurchase event” as defined in the indenture with respect to a series of notes we will be required unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes of such series to offer to purchase the notes of such series at a purchase price equal to 101 percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

we entered into a fouryear revolving credit agreement dated march 11 2011 as amended and effective july 1 2011 the “credit agreement” with a syndicate of lenders including jpmorgan chase bank national association as administrative agent 

under the credit agreement we have an initial borrowing capacity of up to 20 billion we have the right to seek an increase of the total amount available under the credit agreement to 25 billion subject to certain conditions we may obtain up to 15 billion of letters of credit and up to 100 million of swingline loans under the credit agreement we may subject to certain conditions request that the term of the credit agreement be extended for up to two additional oneyear periods each such extension would be subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding and the commitment of any lender that does not consent to an extension of the maturity date will be terminated on the theneffective maturity date at december 31 2011 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type including a maximum ratio of net consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for each consecutive four fiscal quarter period of 30 to 10 and a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement for each consecutive four fiscal quarter period of 35 to 10 as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with these debt covenants with a ratio of net consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of 06 to 10 and a ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement of 784 to 10 the credit agreement includes limitations on indebtedness of our subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the credit agreement 

borrowings of revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest at our option at either i the sum of the adjusted libo rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin ranging between 175 percent to 300 percent depending on our credit ratings or ii the sum of the alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin ranging between 075 percent to 200 percent depending on our credit ratings the credit agreement also provides for customary fees including administrative agent fees commitment fees of 030 percent of the unused portion fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees 

on july 1 2011 we entered into a threeyear trade receivables securitization facility with a syndicate group of committed purchasers conduit purchasers and letter of credit issuers arranged by jp morgan securities llc for an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 10 billion the facility involves one of our wholly owned subsidiaries marathon petroleum company lp “mpc lp” selling or contributing on an ongoing basis all of its trade receivables other than receivables arising in connection with the extension of credit under proprietary credit card services together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof without recourse to another wholly owned bankruptcyremote subsidiary mpc trade receivables company llc “trc” in exchange for a combination of cash equity or a subordinated note issued by trc to mpc lp trc in turn has the ability to sell undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying trade receivables together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof without recourse to certain commercial paper conduit purchasers andor financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds effective october 1 2011 we amended and restated the trade receivables securitization facility to among other things include trade receivables originated by our wholly owned subsidiary marathon petroleum trading canada llc “mptc” 

  

to the extent that trc retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased or received from mpc lp or mptc such interest will be included in our consolidated financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of trc with those of mpc the receivables sold or contributed to trc are available first and foremost to satisfy claims of the creditors of trc and are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of mpc lp mptc or mpc 

proceeds from the sale of undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying receivables under this facility will be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheet we will remain responsible for servicing the receivables sold to thirdparty entities and financial institutions and will pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under this facility at december 31 2011 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility 

the facility includes representations and covenants that we consider usual and customary for arrangements of this type trade receivables are subject to customary criteria limits and reserves before being deemed to qualify for sale by trc pursuant to the facility in addition further purchases of qualified trade receivables under the facility are subject to termination upon the occurrence of certain amortization events that we consider usual and customary for an arrangement of this type 

as of december 31 2011 the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows 

 

 the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in their respective judgments circumstances so warrant 

neither our credit agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded however any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates yields and other fees payable under our revolving credit facility and trade receivables securitization facility in addition a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could under certain circumstances decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility 

  

debttocapital ratios 

our cashadjusted debttocapital ratio total debtminuscash to total debtplusstockholders’ equityminuscash was 2 percent at december 31 2011 compared to 16 percent at june 30 2011 when we became a standalone company our debttototal capital ratio total debt to total debtplusstockholders’ equity was 26 percent at december 31 2011 compared to 27 percent at june 30 2011 

 

 capital requirements 

we have a capital and investment budget of 142 billion excluding capitalized interest for 2012 additional details related to the 2012 capital and investment budget are discussed in the outlook section below 

we plan to make contributions of approximately 240 million to our funded pension plans in 2012 

dividends of 45 cents per share or 160 million were paid in 2011 on february 1 2012 our board of directors approved a 25 cents per share dividend payable march 12 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 16 2012 

on february 1 2012 we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan enabling us to purchase up to 20 billion of mpc common stock over a twoyear period we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases which could include open market purchases negotiated block transactions accelerated share repurchases “asr” or open market solicitations for shares on february 3 2012 we entered into an 850 million asr program with a major financial institution as part of this authorization the total number of shares to be repurchased will be based generally on the volumeweighted average price of mpc common stock during the repurchase period subject to provisions that set a minimum and maximum number of shares under the asr we received 9986 million shares of mpc common stock on february 3 2012 and expect to receive a majority of the additional shares by the end of the first quarter of 2012 as received shares will be reflected in our treasury stock component of stockholders’ equity in the first quarter of 2012 the remaining shares under the asr will be 

  

delivered to us over the term of the transaction with all shares to be delivered by the end of the third quarter of 2012 the timing of repurchases if any outside of the asr will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time 

the above discussion includes forwardlooking statements with respect to the share repurchase authorization factors that could affect the share repurchase program and its timing include but are not limited to business conditions availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock 

contractual cash obligations 

the table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31 2011 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity capital resources and results of operations even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under 

  

accounting principles generally accepted in the united states although offbalance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the offbalance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources 

we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil these arrangements are described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 23 

outlook 

we have a capital and investment budget of 142 billion excluding capitalized interest for 2012 this represents about a 17 percent increase from our 2011 spending the primary focus of the 2012 budget is continuation of the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project which is expected to complete construction in the third quarter of 2012 with full integration into the refinery by yearend 2012 the budget also includes increased spending on transportation logistics and marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

refining  marketing 

the 2012 capital budget includes 745 million for refining  marketing segment projects with approximately 350 million representing continued spending on the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project when completed this project will increase the refinery’s heavy oil upgrading capacity including canadian bitumen blends by about 80 mbpd and will increase its total crude oil refining capacity by approximately 15 mbpd the remainder of the budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements 

speedway 

the 2012 capital budget includes 353 million for our speedway segment relating to new construction and acquisitions to expand our markets and remodeling and rebuilding projects for existing convenience stores to upgrade and enhance our existing facilities also included in the capital budget are expenditures for dispenser equipment and technology upgrades the speedway segment capital budget includes funding to acquire 88 convenience stores situated throughout indiana and ohio from gasamerica services inc “gasamerica” plus several parcels of undeveloped real estate for future development the gasamerica transaction is anticipated to close by the end of may 2012 subject to receipt of regulatory approvals customary due diligence and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions 

pipeline transportation 

the 2012 capital budget includes 230 million for our pipeline transportation segment relating primarily to upgrades to replace or enhance our existing facilities and projects for new infrastructure included in new infrastructure is 20 million which will be used to construct a new section of pipeline to connect an existing pipeline to our detroit refinery this connection will allow us to deliver additional supplies of canadian crude to that refinery 

corporate and other 

the remaining 2012 capital budget includes 91 million related to corporate activities 

in addition we expect to record 116 million in capitalized interest primarily associated with the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project 

  

midstream asset evaluation 

on february 1 2012 we announced that we are evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to certain of our midstream assets including but not limited to the possible formation and initial public offering of an mlp midstream assets are generally considered those involved in transportation storage and logistics operations if we determine to further pursue an initial public offering of an mlp we would not expect to file a registration statement before the end of the second quarter of 2012 

the above discussion includes forwardlooking statements with respect to our midstream asset evaluation there can be no assurance that this evaluation will lead to an initial public offering of an mlp or any other transaction or that if any transaction is further pursued that it will be consummated some of the factors that could affect the midstream asset evaluation and the outcome of such evaluation include risks relating to securities markets generally the impact of adverse market conditions affecting our midstream business adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters and other risks 

our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forwardlooking statements are based on currently available information if this information proves to be inaccurate future availability of financing may be adversely affected factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided by operating activities the state of worldwide debt and equity markets investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance the global financial climate and in particular with respect to borrowings the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies the discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forwardlooking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending the forwardlooking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance actual results may differ materially from these expectations estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks natural gas and refined products actions of competitors delays in obtaining necessary thirdparty approvals disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response and other operating and economic considerations 

transactions with related parties 

following completion of the spinoff on june 30 2011 marathon oil retained no ownership interest in us and is no longer a related party 

purchases of crude oil and natural gas from marathon oil accounted for five percent or less of our total cost of revenues and purchases from related parties for the periods prior to the spinoff related party purchases of crude oil and natural gas from marathon oil were at marketbased contract prices the crude oil prices were based on indices that represented market value for time and place of delivery and that were also used in thirdparty contracts the natural gas prices equaled the price at which marathon oil purchased the natural gas from third parties plus the cost of transportation 

we believe that transactions with related parties other than certain transactions with marathon oil to effect the spinoff and related to the provision of administrative services were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties 

on may 25 2011 we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with marathon oil to effect the spinoff and to provide a framework for our relationship with marathon oil because 

  

the terms of our separation from marathon oil and these agreements were entered into in the context of a relatedparty transaction the terms may not be comparable to terms that would be obtained in a transaction between unaffiliated parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 for further discussion of activity with related parties 

environmental matters and compliance costs 

we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations if these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our operating results will be adversely affected we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations however the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of its operating facilities marketing areas production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 

legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including costs of compliance and permitting delays the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered the costs and the time frames for compliance and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers for additional information see item 1a risk factors 

our environmental expenditures based on the american petroleum institute’s definition of environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were 

 

  we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 

new or expanded environmental requirements which could increase our environmental costs may arise in the future we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation or regulations it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed 

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 13 percent of capital expenditures in 2011 19 percent of capital expenditures in 2010 and 12 percent in 2009 our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate 64 million or 5 percent of total capital expenditures in 2012 predictions beyond 2012 can only be broadbased estimates which have varied and will continue to vary due to the ongoing evolution of specific 

  

regulatory requirements the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies among other matters based on currently identified projects we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately 64 million in 2013 however actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 

we have spent 620 million from 2008 through december 31 2011 to comply with msat ii regulations relating to benzene content in refined products we have finalized our strategic approach to comply with msat ii regulations and all msat ii compliance units were in operation as of december 31 2011 

for more information on environmental regulations that impact us or could impact us see item 1 business—environmental matters item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods accounting estimates are considered to be critical if 1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 

fair value estimates 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities the market approach the income approach and the cost approach each of which includes multiple valuation techniques the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts such as cash flows or earnings into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset this is often referred to as current replacement cost the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence 

the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions including assumptions about risk level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows 

 

   

  

 valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 

significant uses of fair value measurements include 

 

  

  

  

  

 impairment assessments of longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions significant assumptions include 

 

  

  

  

 we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a poor outlook for profitability a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes significant reduction in refining margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located 

  

  

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining  marketing segment assets site level for speedway segment convenience stores or the pipeline system level for pipeline transportation segment assets if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group fair value is calculated and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value 

unlike longlived assets goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at december 31 2011 we had a total of 842 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value appreciably for each of our reporting units in 2011 

equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value at december 31 2011 we had 302 million of investments in equity method investments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions eg pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

derivatives 

we record all derivative instruments at fair value a large volume of our commodity derivatives are exchangetraded and require few assumptions in arriving at fair value fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments in debt and equity securities 

we record all of our investments in debt and equity securities at fair value our investments in related party debt securities were redeemable on any business day at a stated price which had been determined to approximate fair value our investments in other equity securities are exchangetraded and fair value is determined from quoted market prices 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions the most significant of which relate to the following 

 

    we develop our demographics and utilize the work of thirdparty actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns the selected rates are compared to 

  

various similar bond indexes for reasonableness in determining the assumed discount rates we use our thirdparty actuary’s discount rate model this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 05 to 99 years the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and only noncallable bonds are included outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included each issue is required to have at least 250 million par value outstanding 

of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans decreasing the discount rates of 430 percent for our pension plans and 465 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 025 would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by 131 million and 21 million respectively and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by 11 million and 1 million respectively 

the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent fixed income securities for the funded pension plans past performance and other factors certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns our long term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness after evaluating activity in the capital markets we reduced the asset rate of return from 850 percent to 750 percent effective for 2012 defined benefit pension expense decreasing the 750 percent asset rate of return assumption by 025 would increase our defined benefit pension expense by 4 million 

compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans 

health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the yearend balance sheets 

contingent liabilities 

we accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions claims litigation environmental remediation tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and third party indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable we regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons for instance settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes which are recorded as other taxes for additional information on contingent liabilities see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters and compliance costs 

  

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 

accounting standards not yet adopted 

in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standards update that requires disclosure of additional information related to recognized financial and derivative instruments that are offset or are not offset but are subject to an enforceable netting agreement the purpose of the requirement is to help users evaluate the effect or potential effect of offsetting and related netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position the update is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods that begin on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods adoption of this update will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standards update giving an entity the option to use a qualitative assessment to determine whether or not the entity is required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test if through a qualitative assessment an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount the entity is not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test the amendments in the update are effective for annual and interim goodwill testing performed in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 early adoption is permitted the adoption of this accounting standards update will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in may 2011 the fasb issued an update amending the accounting standards for fair value measurement and disclosure resulting in common principles and requirements under us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” the amendments change the wording used to describe certain of the us gaap requirements either to clarify the intent of existing requirements to change measurement or expand disclosure principles or to conform to the wording used in ifrs the amendments are to be applied prospectively and will be effective in interim and annual periods beginning with the first quarter of 2012 for us early application is not permitted we do not expect adoption of these amendments to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices we employ various strategies including the use of commodity derivative instruments to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use financial derivative instruments to manage the risks related to interest rate fluctuations we are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction 

we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material adverse consequences while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes 16 and 17 for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes we designate our interest rate derivative instruments as fair value hedges 

commodity price risk 

our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments including futures forwards swaps and combinations of options as part of an overall program to manage commodity price risk we also may utilize the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions 

we use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to manage price risk associated with inventories above or below lastin firstout inventory targets we also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreignsourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to manage price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended in addition we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to manage risk by converting the refined product sales to marketbased prices the majority of these derivatives are exchangetraded contracts for crude oil refined products and ethanol 

we closely monitor and manage our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy 

  

open derivative positions and sensitivity analysis 

the table below sets forth information relating to our significant open commodity derivative contracts as of december 31 2011 

 

  

    sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations “ifo” of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2011 is provided in the following table 

 

 we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments however such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis 

we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles changes to the portfolio after december 31 2011 would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above 

interest rate risk 

we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations related to our debt obligations at december 31 2011 our debt was primarily comprised of the 30 billion fixed rate senior notes issued on february 1 2011 

in 2011 we entered into interest rate swap derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk associated with a portion of the fixed interest rate debt in our portfolio as of december 31 2011 we had interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of 500 million at a weighted average liborbased floating rate of 202 percent this interest rate swap is designated as a fair value hedge which effectively results in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for an obligation to pay floating rates 

  

sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 100basispoint shift in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of december 31 2011 is provided in the following table 

 

  

    at december 31 2011 our portfolio of longterm debt was substantially comprised of fixedrate instruments therefore the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixedrate debt at prices above carrying value 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in canadian dollars we did not utilize derivatives to manage our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2011 

counterparty risk 

we are also exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties or brokers we regularly review the creditworthiness of counterparties and brokers and enter into master netting agreements when appropriate 

forwardlooking statements 

these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forwardlooking statements with respect to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil other refinery feedstocks refined products and ethanol if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements
