apa maintains a diversified asset portfolio including conventional and unconventional onshore and offshore exploration and production interests in the us apa operations are primarily focused in the permian basin of west texas and eastern new mexico with additional operations located in the eagle ford shale and austin chalk areas of southeast texas offshore in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast internationally the company has conventional onshore assets in egypt’s western desert offshore assets on the uk’s continental shelf an offshore appraisal and exploration program in suriname and an offshore exploration block in the dominican republic 

rigorous management of the company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long term over the past several years apa has entered into a series of transactions that have upgraded its portfolio of assets enhanced its capital allocation process to further optimize investment returns and increased focus on internally generated exploration with fullcycle returnsfocused growth management actively reviews certain nonstrategic assets for opportunities which include potential monetization of legacy properties and other noncore leasehold positions 

during 2021 the company made significant progress on key aspects of its portfolio specifically the company refreshed the economic foundation for its business in egypt with the announcement of the ratification of a modernized productionsharing contract psc with the egyptian ministry of petroleum and the egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc the new psc consolidates the majority of the company’s gross acreage and production in egypt into a single concession and refreshes existing development and exploration lease terms the modernized psc incentivizes increased investment and production growth and places egypt at the top of many attractive investment opportunities in apa’s global portfolio 

in october 2021 altus midstream company altm announced that it will combine with privately owned bcp raptor holdco lp bcp in an allstock transaction and apa’s ownership in altm will be reduced from approximately 79 percent to approximately 20 percent reducing apa’s interest in altus to a minority position will have a number of benefits to apa shareholders including simplification of its financial reporting and enhanced comparability with its upstreamonly peers while maintaining a noncontrolling interest in future growth opportunities 

the global economy and the energy industry have been deeply impacted by the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions uncertainty in the commodity and financial markets since early 2020 continue to impact oil supply and demand despite these uncertainties the company remains committed to its longerterm objectives 1 to maintain a balanced asset portfolio including advancement of ongoing exploration and appraisal activities offshore suriname 2 to invest for longterm returns over production growth and 3 to budget conservatively to generate cash flow in excess of its upstream exploration appraisal and development capital program that can be directed to debt reduction share repurchases and return of capital to its stakeholders the company continues to aggressively manage its cost structure regardless of the oil price environment and closely monitors hydrocarbon pricing fundamentals to reallocate capital as part of its ongoing planning process

business overview 

the following business overview further describes the operations and activities for the company’s upstream exploration and production properties by geographic region and altus midstream 

upstream exploration and production 

operating areas 

apa has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas the us egypt and offshore the uk in the north sea apa also has active exploration and appraisal operations ongoing in suriname as well as interests in other international locations that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities 

the following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key 2021 data for each of the company’s operating areas additional data and discussion are provided in part ii item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k 



1 the company’s operations in egypt excluding the impacts of a onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 22 percent of 2021 production and accounted for 16 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

2 sales volumes from the company’s north sea assets for 2021 were 161 mmboe sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the beryl field 

united states 

in 2021 the company’s us upstream oil and gas operations contributed approximately 59 percent of production and 68 percent of estimated yearend proved reserves consistent with prior years apa has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 38 million gross acres 18 million net acres in the us 75 percent of which are undeveloped 

the company’s us assets are primarily located in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico including the permian subbasins midland basin central basin platformnorthwest shelf and delaware basin examples of shale plays being developed within these subbasins include the woodford barnett pennsylvanian cline wolfcamp bone spring and spraberry apa is one of the largest operators in the permian basin operating approximately 6000 gross oil and gas wells across its acreage with additional interests in more than 3000 nonoperated wells of note approximately six percent of the company’s net acreage position in the permian basin is on federal onshore lands apa also has operations located in the eagle ford shale and austin chalk areas of southeast texas offshore in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast in south texas and louisiana 

highlights of the company’s operations in the us include 

• southern midland basin apa holds approximately 332000 gross acres 238000 net acres in the southern midland basin during 2021 the company averaged one rig targeting oil plays in the wolfcamp and spraberry formations drilling 49 gross development wells in this basin with a 100 percent success rate 

• delaware basin apa holds approximately 267000 gross acres 134000 net acres in the delaware basin including opportunities in the bone spring and other formations of eastern new mexico and bordering west texas and the alpine high play in the southern portion of the permian basin primarily in reeves county texas during 2021 the company focused on completing wells drilled from previous years and completed 27 gross development wells 

• legacy assets apa holds approximately 32 million gross acres 15 million net acres in legacy properties of which 11 million gross acres are in the offshore waters of the gulf of mexico legacy onshore properties are located primarily in the eagle ford shale and austin chalk areas of southeast texas the company participated in drilling 14 gross nonoperated development wells in these areas during 2021 the company also initiated a targeted drilling program on its austin chalk acreage where it will continue to evaluate and highgrade inventory opportunities consistent with the company’s broader portfolio management efforts certain nonstrategic leasehold positions on its legacy acreage holdings during the year were divested primarily in the central basin platform subbasin of the permian basin and additional monetization opportunities are continuing to be evaluated 

• new venture assets apa separately has undeveloped acreage positions across several states where it intends to pursue exploration interests and potential development opportunities over time 

• during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company announced that it has ended routine flaring in its us onshore operations achieving one of its announced 2021 environmental social and governance esg goals three months ahead of schedule 

with the improvement in commodity prices the company is returning to a modest level of activity in the us after halting all drilling and completion activity for most of 2020 in early 2021 the company reactivated one rig in the permian basin and one rig in the austin chalk a second rig was added in the permian basin in late june 2021 for 2022 the company will continue to budget its capital program at levels to fund activity necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved oil and natural gas reserves future rig activity levels and drilling targets will be dependent on the success of the company’s drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically 

us marketing in general most of the company’s us natural gas production is sold at either monthly or daily indexbased prices the tenor of the company’s sales contracts span from daily to multiyear transactions natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution utility and midstream companies as well as endusers marketers and integrated major oil companies apa strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk the company predominantly sells its natural gas production within the us including to us lng export facilities although a portion may be sold to markets in mexico 

apa primarily markets its us crude oil production to integrated major oil companies marketing and transportation companies and refiners based on west texas intermediate wti pricing indices eg wti houston west texas sour wts or wti midland and some predominately brent related international pricing indices adjusted for quality transportation and a marketreflective differential the company’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product sales contracts are generally 30day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party these contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices also from time to time the company will enter into physical term sales contracts these term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide an opportunity for higher than prevailing market prices 

apa’s us ngl production is sold under contracts with prices based on gulf coast supply and demand conditions less the costs for transportation and fractionation or on a weightedaverage sales price received by the purchaser 

us delivery commitments the company has longterm delivery commitments for natural gas and crude oil that require apa to deliver an average of 251 bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2022 through 2029 at variable marketbased pricing and deliver an average of 64 mmbbls of crude oil per year from 2022 through 2025 at variable marketbased pricing 

apa currently expects to fulfill its delivery commitments with production from its proved reserves production from continued development andor spot market purchases as necessary apa may also enter into contractual arrangements to reduce its delivery commitments the company has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its delivery commitments 

for more information regarding the company’s commitments please see part ii item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—capital resources and liquidity—contractual obligations of this annual report on form 10k 

international 

in 2021 international assets contributed 41 percent of apa’s production and 50 percent of oil and gas revenues approximately 32 percent of estimated proved reserves at yearend were located outside the us 

apa has two international locations with ongoing development and production operations 

• egypt which includes onshore conventional assets located in egypt’s western desert and 

• the north sea which includes offshore assets based in the uk 

the company also has an active offshore exploration program and appraisal operations ongoing in suriname and an offshore exploration block in the dominican republic 

egypt apa has 26 years of exploration development and operations experience in egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in egypt’s western desert at yearend 2021 the company held 53 million gross acres in egypt in six separate concessions but primarily held in a new single concession that resulted from the ratification of a modernized production sharing contract psc with the egyptian government as more fully described below development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 1 to 20 years with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis approximately 68 percent of the company’s gross acreage in egypt is undeveloped providing apa with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future 

apa’s egypt operations are conducted pursuant to pscs under the terms of the company’s pscs the company is the contractor partner contractor with egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc and bears the risk and cost of exploration development and production activities in return if exploration is successful the contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery additionally the contractor’s income taxes which remain the liability of the contractor under domestic law are paid by egpc on behalf of the contractor out of egpc’s production entitlement income taxes paid to the arab republic of egypt on behalf of the contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and are reflected as production and estimated reserves because contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices in addition because the contractor income taxes are paid by egpc the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on the company’s egypt operations despite impacting the company’s production and reserves 

on december 27 2021 the company announced the ratification of a modernized psc with egpc having an effective date of april 1 2021 the new psc consolidates 98 percent of gross acreage and 90 percent of gross production into a single concession and refreshes the existing development lease terms for 20 years and exploration leases for 5 years the consolidated concession has a single cost recovery pool to provide improved access to cost recovery a fixed 40 percent cost recovery limit and a fixed profitsharing rate of 30 percent for all the company’s production covered under the new concession the apa subsidiary that became the sole contractor under the psc is owned by an apaoperated joint venture owned twothirds by the company and onethird by sinopec international petroleum exploration and production corporation sinopec 

the company’s estimated proved reserves in egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves through the joint venture sinopec holds a onethird minority participation interest in the company’s oil and gas operations in egypt the company’s egypt assets including the onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 30 percent of 2021 production and 21 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves excluding the impacts of the noncontrolling interest egypt contributed 22 percent of 2021 production and 16 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

in 2021 the company drilled 30 gross development and 24 gross exploration wells in egypt a key component of the company’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3d seismic surveys that enable the company’s technical teams to consistently highgrade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the cretaceous jurassic and deeper paleozoic formations the company has completed seismic surveys covering over 3 million acres to date and continues to build and enhance its drilling inventory in egypt supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations on both new and existing acreage 

for 2022 the company plans to increase activity to a 15 rig drilling program for the year and increase well completions by approximately three times compared to 2021 with a goal of growing gross oil production 13 to 15 percent 

north sea the company has interests in approximately 494000 gross acres in the uk north sea these assets contributed 11 percent of the company’s 2021 production and approximately 11 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

the company entered the north sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the forties field forties since acquiring forties the company has actively invested in these assets and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of 4d seismic building upon its success in forties in 2011 the company acquired mobil north sea limited providing the company with additional exploration and development opportunities in the north sea across numerous fields including operated interests in the beryl ness nevis nevis south skene and buckland fields and a nonoperated interest in the maclure field the company also has a nonoperated interest in the nelson field acquired in 2011 the beryl field which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential provides for significant exploration opportunity the north sea assets play a strategic role in apa’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with highimpact exploration potential near existing infrastructure 

during 2021 the company averaged two rigs in the north sea and drilled 4 gross development and two gross exploration wells production was significantly impacted by compressor downtime extended platform turnaround work and thirdparty outage during 2021 

in 2022 the expected capital program for the north sea remains relatively unchanged from the prior year with one floating rig and one platform crew 

international marketing the company’s natural gas production in egypt is sold to egpc primarily under an industrypricing formula a sliding scale based on dated brent crude oil with a minimum of 150 per mmbtu and a maximum of 265 per mmbtu plus an upward adjustment for liquids content crude oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to egpc when called upon to supply domestic demand oil production sold to third parties is sold and exported from one of two terminals on the northern coast of egypt oil production sold to egpc is sold at prices related to the export market  

the company’s north sea crude oil production is sold under term entitlement volume contracts and spot variable volume contracts with a marketbased index price plus a differential to capture the higher market value under each type of arrangement natural gas from the beryl field is processed through the scottish area gas evacuation sage gas plant operated by ancala midstream acquisitions limited natural gas is sold to a third party at the st fergus entry point of the national grid on a national balancing point index price basis the condensate mix from the sage plant is processed further downstream the split streams of propane butane and condensate are sold separately on a monthly entitlement basis at the braefoot bay terminal using index pricing less transportation 

other exploration 

new ventures apa’s international new ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the company’s traditional core areas and targeting higherrisk higherreward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins 

in december 2019 the company entered into a joint venture agreement with totalenergies formerly total sa to explore and develop block 58 offshore suriname the company holds a 50 percent working interest in block 58 which comprises approximately 14 million gross acres in water depths ranging from less than 100 meters to more than 2100 meters starting in late 2019 and throughout 2020 the company drilled the first three wells in the block the maka central1 sapakara west1 and kwaskwasi1 all of which successfully tested for the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper cretaceousaged campanian and santonian intervals encountering both oil and gas condensate 

in january 2021 apa and totalenergies announced the fourth consecutive discovery in block 58 at keskesi east1 which confirmed oil in the eastern portion of the block in accordance with the joint venture agreement the company transferred operatorship of block 58 to totalenergies on january 1 2021 totalenergies holds a 50 percent working interest in block 58 as the operator with an active appraisal and exploration program budgeted for 2022 

the company is also a 45 percent working interest holder in suriname on block 53 where technical work completed in 2021 has led to the resumption of exploration activities an exploration well is planned for early 2022 with partners cepsa and petronas who have a 25 percent and 30 percent working interest respectively 

apa also holds an offshore exploration block in the dominican republic 

drilling statistics 

worldwide in 2021 apa drilled or participated in drilling 166 gross wells with 145 wells 87 percent completed as producers historically apa’s drilling activities in the us have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration as a general matter the company’s operations outside of the us focus on a mix of exploration and development wells in addition to wells completed at yearend a number of wells had not yet reached completion 53 gross 417 net in the us 22 gross 220 net in egypt 1 gross 1 net in the north sea and 1 gross 05 net in suriname 

the following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years 



productive oil and gas wells 

the number of productive oil and gas wells operated and nonoperated in which the company had an interest as of december 31 2021 is set forth below 



gross natural gas and crude oil wells include 494 wells with multiple completions 

production pricing and lease operating cost data 

the following table describes for each of the last three fiscal years oil ngl and gas production volumes average lease operating costs per boe including transportation costs but excluding severance and other taxes and average sales prices for each of the countries where the company has operations 



1 includes production volumes attributable to a onethird noncontrolling interest in egypt 

2 sales volumes from the company’s north sea assets for 2021  2020 and 2019 were 161 mmboe 227 mmboe and 218 mmboe respectively sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the beryl field 

gross and net undeveloped and developed acreage 

the following table summarizes the company’s gross and net acreage position as of december 31 2021 



as of december 31 2021 the company held 636000 net undeveloped acres that are scheduled to expire by yearend 2022 if production is not established or the company takes no action to extend the terms the company also held 10000 and 97000 net undeveloped acres set to expire by yearend 2023 and 2024 respectively the company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the company and third parties including governments no oil and gas reserves were recorded on this undeveloped acreage set to expire 

exploration concessions in the company’s egypt asset were extended upon ratification of the modernized psc with the egpc and no acreage is scheduled to expire over the next three years the company will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist 

additionally the company has exploration interests in block 53 and block 58 offshore suriname and offshore the dominican republic approximately 390000 net undeveloped acres in block 53 are set to expire in 2022 contingent on planned drilling activity the company also continues to assess contract and potentially explore undeveloped acreage positions in other international locations 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 93 percent of us net undeveloped acreage was held by production or owned as undeveloped mineral rights 

estimated proved reserves and future net cash flows 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas crude oil condensate and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods the company reports all estimated proved reserves held under productionsharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method which excludes the host country’s share of reserves 

estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed the costs of the operation reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been fieldtested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation in estimating its proved reserves apa uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy with similar properties the company will at times utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models petrophysical techniques and proprietary 3d seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the company’s reserve estimates 

proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period 

the following table shows proved oil ngl and gas reserves as of december 31 2021 based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2021 held flat for the life of the production except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms the total column of this table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl this ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products 



1 includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of 62 mmboe and 4 mmboe respectively attributable to a onethird noncontrolling interest in egypt 

as of december 31 2021 the company had total estimated proved reserves of 400 mmbbls of crude oil 183 mmbbls of ngls and 20 tcf of natural gas combined these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of 913 million boe of which liquids represents 64 percent as of december 31 2021 the company’s proved developed reserves totaled 828 mmboe and estimated pud reserves totaled 85 mmboe or approximately 9 percent of worldwide total proved reserves apa has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing the company has one field that contains 15 percent or more of its total proved reserves for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 and none in 2019 

during 2021 the company added 102 mmboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity there were also upward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 107 mmboe upward revisions related to changes in product prices accounted for 85 mmboe engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 22 mmboe with the modernized psc in egypt resulting in an increase of 57 mmboe partially offset by other downward revisions of 35 mmboe across all of the company’s geographic areas of operations the company also sold 28 mmboe of proved reserves associated with us divestitures primarily related to the permian basin 

as previously discussed in december 2021 the egyptian government signed into law an agreement to modernize and consolidate a majority of the company’s egypt pscs the impact of the consolidated psc to proved reserves based on the modernized terms is an estimated increase of 53 mmboe and 4 mmboe in developed and undeveloped reserves respectively and approximately 750 million in discounted future net cash flows approximately 96 percent of the company’s egypt reserves are now consolidated within the modernized psc these estimates include sinopec’s noncontrolling interest in egypt 

the company’s estimates of proved reserves proved developed reserves and pud reserves as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in note 18—supplemental oil and gas disclosures unaudited in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum end of period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months held flat for the life of the production except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements 

proved undeveloped reserves 

the company’s total estimated pud reserves of 85 mmboe as of december 31 2021 increased by 9 mmboe from 76 mmboe of pud reserves reported at year end 2020 during the year the company converted 33 mmboe of pud reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity in the us the company converted 28 mmboe with the remaining 5 mmboe in its international areas the company sold 2 mmboe of pud reserves in the us and did not acquire any pud reserves during the year the company added 63 mmboe of new pud reserves through extensions and discoveries downward revisions totaled 19 mmboe comprising 7 mmboe associated with engineering and interest revisions 11 mmboe associated with revised development plans and 1 mmboe associated with product prices 

during 2021 a total of approximately 213 million was spent on projects associated with proved undeveloped reserves a portion of apa’s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will convert undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in future years during 2021 the company spent approximately 174 million on pud reserve development activity in the us and 39 million in the international areas as of december 31 2021 the company had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure 

preparation of oil and gas reserve information 

the company’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which by their very nature are subject to revision these estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward as warranted 

apa’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups these engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of the company’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production costs net revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves all relevant data is compiled in a computer database application to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to apa’s board of directors in summary form on a quarterly basis annually each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating asset engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses netback prices production trends and development timing are reasonable 

apa’s executive vice president of development is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the company’s internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a thirdparty engineering firm he has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in petroleum engineering and over 30 years of experience in the energy industry and energy sector of the banking industry the executive vice president of development reports directly to the company’s chief executive officer 

the estimate of reserves disclosed in this annual report on form 10k is prepared by the company’s internal staff and the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates the company engages ryder scott company lp petroleum consultants ryder scott to conduct a reserves audit which includes a review of the company’s processes and the reasonableness of the company’s estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves the company selects the properties for review by ryder scott based primarily on relative reserve value the company also considers other factors such as geographic location new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume during 2021 the properties selected for each country ranged from 82 to 84 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent these properties also accounted for 83 percent of the value of the company’s international proved reserves and 94 percent of the value of the company’s new wells drilled worldwide in addition all fields containing five percent or more of the company’s total proved reserves volume were included in ryder scott’s review the review covered 80 percent of total proved reserves on a boe basis 

ryder scott’s review for the years 2021 2020 and 2019 covered 83 85 and 87 percent respectively of the value and 80 81 and 85 percent respectively of the volume of the company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves ryder scott’s 2021 review covered 80 80 and 81 percent of the estimated proved reserve volume in the us egypt and uk respectively 

ryder scott’s review of 2020 covered 80 percent of us 82 percent of egypt and 83 percent of the uk’s total proved reserves 

ryder scott’s review of 2019 covered 85 percent of us 86 percent of egypt and 80 percent of the uk’s total proved reserves

competitive conditions 

the oil and gas industry is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves the acquisition of oil and gas leases equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves and the gathering and marketing of oil gas and ngls the company’s competitors include national oil companies major integrated oil and gas companies other independent oil and gas companies and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial commercial and individual consumers 

certain of the company’s competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than the company possesses or have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the company may seek new entry as a consequence the company may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights 

however the company believes its diversified portfolio of core assets which comprises large acreage positions and wellestablished production bases across three geographic areas its balanced production mix between oil and gas its management and incentive systems and its experienced personnel give it a strong competitive position relative to many of the company’s competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity the company’s global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which it has producing operations to which it can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices local business environments and markets this also reduces the risk that the company will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country 

environmental compliance 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities the company is subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole the company does not believe that these requirements affect it differently to any material degree than other companies in the oil and gas industry 

the company has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with these requirements which the company believes are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry the company has established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations including regulations applicable to its operations in all countries in which it does business the company has established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of its field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations the costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that the company is unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters however the company does not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

risks related to pricing demand and production for crude oil natural gas and ngls 

the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact the company’s business financial condition and results of operations the global economy and the demand for and prices of oil natural gas and ngls the unprecedented nature of the current situation makes it impossible for the company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business 

the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic have adversely impacted the global economy and created significant volatility in the global financial markets business closures restrictions on travel “stayathome” or “shelterinplace” orders and other restrictions on movement within and among communities have significantly reduced demand for and the prices of oil natural gas and ngls as of the date of this annual report on form 10k efforts to contain covid19 have not been successful in many regions vaccination distribution programs have encountered delays new variants have emerged and the global pandemic remains ongoing while some geographic regions have lifted relaxed or otherwise modified their pandemic response measures to lessen the impact of such measures on business operations and commerce these regions may reinstitute restrictions as circumstances change a continued prolonged period or a renewed period of reduced demand the failure to timely distribute or the ineffectiveness of or reluctance or refusal of individuals to take any vaccines the failure to develop adequate treatments and other adverse impacts from the pandemic may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

the company’s operations rely on its workforce being able to access its wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with its oil and gas leases additionally because the company has previously implemented and may elect to or be required in the future to reimplement remote working procedures for a significant portion of its workforce for health and safety reasons andor to comply with applicable national state andor local government requirements the company relies on such persons having sufficient access to its information technology systems including through telecommunication hardware software and networks if a significant portion of the company’s workforce cannot effectively perform their responsibilities whether resulting from a lack of physical or virtual access quarantines illnesses governmental actions or restrictions including vaccine mandates and the reactions thereto information technology or telecommunication failures or other restrictions or adverse impacts resulting from the pandemic the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the unprecedented nature of the current situation resulting from the covid19 pandemic makes it impossible for the company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business financial condition cash flows or results of operations such results will depend on future events which the company cannot predict including the scope duration and potential reoccurrence of the covid19 pandemic the emergence and impact of covid19 variants or any other localized epidemic or global pandemic the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines therapeutics and treatments the demand for and the prices of oil natural gas and ngls and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities customers contractors and suppliers in response to the covid19 pandemic or any other epidemics or pandemics the covid19 pandemic and its unprecedented consequences have amplified and may continue to amplify the other risks identified in this annual report on form 10k 

crude oil natural gas and ngl price volatility could adversely affect the company’s operating results and the price of apa’s common stock 

the company’s revenues operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices it receives for its crude oil natural gas and ngl production historically the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future for example the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2021 ranged from a high of 8564 per barrel to a low of 4747 per barrel the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2021 ranged from a high of 2386 per mmbtu to a low of 243 per mmbtu the market prices for 

crude oil natural gas and ngls depend on factors beyond the company’s control these factors include demand which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors including 

• worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil natural gas and ngls 

• actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations including the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec 

• political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions 

• the occurrence of global events such as epidemics or pandemics including specifically the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities customers contractors and suppliers in response to such epidemics or pandemics 

• the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories 

• the price and level of imported foreign crude oil natural gas and ngls 

• the price and availability of alternative fuels including coal and biofuels 

• the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure 

• the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity 

• weather conditions 

• the impact of political pressure and the influence of environmental groups and other stakeholders on decisions and policies related to the industries in which the company and its affiliates operate 

• domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes including legislative regulatory policy changes or initiatives and addressing the impact of global climate change hydraulic fracturing methane emissions flaring or water disposal and 

• the overall economic environment 

the company’s results of operations as well as the carrying value of its oil and gas properties are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil natural gas and ngls low prices have previously adversely affected and could again adversely affect the company’s revenues operating income cash flow and proved reserves and continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations and limit its ability to fund capital expenditures without the ability to fund capital expenditures the company would be unable to replace reserves and production sustained low prices of crude oil natural gas and ngls may further adversely impact the company’s business as follows 

• weakening the company’s financial condition and reducing its liquidity 

• limiting the company’s ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations 

• reducing the amount of crude oil natural gas and ngls that the company can produce economically 

• causing the company to delay or postpone some of its capital projects 

• reducing the company’s revenues operating income and cash flows 

• limiting the company’s access to sources of capital such as equity and longterm debt 

• reducing the carrying value of the company’s oil and gas properties resulting in additional noncash impairments or 

• reducing the carrying value of the company’s gathering processing and transmission facilities resulting in additional impairments 

the company’s ability to sell crude oil natural gas or ngls andor receive market prices for these commodities andor meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints the inability to procure and resell volumes economically and various transportation interruptions 

a portion of the company’s crude oil natural gas and ngl production in any region may be interrupted limited or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons including as a result of weather conditions accidents loss of pipeline or gathering system access field labor issues or strikes or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering 

systems processing facilities or interstate pipelines to transport the company’s production or the company might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions if a substantial amount of the company’s production is interrupted at the same time it could temporarily adversely affect the company’s cash flows additionally if the company is unable to procure and resell thirdparty volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation the company’s cash flows could be adversely affected 

the company may not realize an adequate return on wells that it drills 

drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks including the risk that the company will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the wells the company drills or participates in may not be productive and the company may not recover all or any portion of its investment in those wells the seismic data and other technologies the company uses do not allow it to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically the costs of drilling completing and operating wells are often uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

• unexpected drilling conditions 

• pressure or irregularities in formations 

• equipment failures or accidents 

• fires explosions blowouts and surface cratering 

• marine risks such as capsizing collisions and hurricanes 

• other adverse weather conditions and 

• increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment 

future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure could have an adverse effect on the company’s future results of operations and financial condition while all drilling whether developmental or exploratory involves these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

the company’s commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent it from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose it to other risks 

to the extent that the company engages in price risk management activities to protect itself from commodity price declines the company may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk in addition the company’s hedging arrangements may expose it to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which 

• the company’s production falls short of the hedged volumes 

• there is a widening of pricebasis differentials between delivery points for the company’s production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement 

• the counterparties to the company’s hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements or 

• an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices 

risks related to operations and development projects 

the company’s operations involve a high degree of operational risk particularly risk of personal injury damage to or loss of equipment and environmental accidents 

the company’s operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling production and transportation of crude oil natural gas and ngls including 

• well blowouts explosions fires and cratering 

• pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills 

• formations with abnormal pressures 

• equipment malfunctions 

• hurricanes major storms and cyclones which could affect the company’s operations in areas such as on and offshore the gulf coast north sea and suriname and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions and 

• surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents saltwater or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives 

failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions cyberattacks or natural disasters such as hurricanes could result in property damages personal injury environmental pollution and other damages for which the company could be liable litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence such as a well blowout explosion fire at a location where the company’s equipment and services are used or ground water contamination from chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing may result in substantial claims for damages ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses if a significant amount of the company’s production is interrupted containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence the company’s cash flows and in turn its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on the company’s revenues and production 

demand for oil and natural gas are to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impact the price the company receives for the commodities it produces in addition the company’s exploration development and production activities and equipment have been and can be adversely affected by severe weather such as freezing temperatures hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or major storms in the north sea which have previously caused and may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment the company’s planning for normal climatic variation insurance programs and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions and not all such effects can be predicted eliminated or insured against 

the company’s insurance policies do not cover all of the risks the company faces which could result in significant financial exposure 

exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and ngls can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts cratering fires explosions and loss of well control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment the company’s international operations are also subject to political risk the insurance coverage that the company maintains against certain losses or liabilities arising from its operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability moreover insurance is not available to the company against all operational risks 

a terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by the company or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact the company’s operations 

the company’s business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development and production activities the company depends on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves process and record financial and operating data analyze seismic and drilling information communicate with personnel and thirdparty partners and conduct many of the company’s activities unauthorized access to the company’s digital technology could lead to operational disruption data corruption communication interruption loss of intellectual property loss of confidential and fiduciary data and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information also external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the us and abroad which are necessary to transport and market the company’s production a cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems have previously and could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions any such terrorist attack environmental activist group activity or cyberattack that affects the company or its customers suppliers or others with whom it does business could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business cause it to incur a material financial loss subject it to possible legal claims and liability andor damage its reputation 

while certain of the company’s insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events if the company were to incur a significant liability for which it was not fully insured that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur 

while the company has experienced cyberattacks in the past it has not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks however there is no assurance that the company will not suffer such losses in the future further as cyberattacks continue to evolve the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in addition cyberattacks against the company or others in its industry could result in additional regulations which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures the company cannot predict the potential impact that such additional regulations could have on its business and operations or the energy industry at large 

material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects 

the company is involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond the company’s anticipated completion dates these projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies weather conditions manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment and other unforeseen events delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect the company’s large development projects and its ability to participate in largescale development projects in the future in addition the company’s estimates of future development costs are based on its current expectations of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel the company will need to implement such projects the actual future development costs may be significantly higher than the company currently estimates if costs become too high the development projects may become uneconomic to the company and it may be forced to abandon such development projects 

risks related to reserves and leasehold acreage 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rate from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted while related perunit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore unless the company adds reserves through exploration and development activities identifies additional behindpipe zones secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies or acquires additional properties containing proved reserves the company’s estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced future oil and gas production is therefore highly dependent upon the company’s level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis furthermore as oil or natural gas prices increase the company’s cost for additional reserves could also increase 

the company may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves 

although the company performs a review of properties that it acquires which the company believes is consistent with industry practices such reviews are inherently incomplete it generally is not feasible to review indepth every individual property involved in each acquisition ordinarily the company will focus its review efforts on the highervalue properties and will sample the remainder however even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor will it permit the company as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the company often assumes certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates in addition there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon the company’s operating results particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into the company’s ongoing operations 

crude oil natural gas and ngl reserves are estimates and actual recoveries may vary significantly 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil natural gas and ngl reserves and their value reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil natural gas and ngls that cannot be measured in an exact manner because of the high degree of judgment involved the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation the company’s reserves estimates are based on 12month average prices except where contractual arrangements exist therefore 

reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease in addition results of drilling testing and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time the estimates of the company’s proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results including 

• historical production from the area compared with production from other areas 

• the effects of regulations by governmental agencies including changes to severance and excise taxes 

• future operating costs and capital expenditures and 

• workover and remediation costs 

for these reasons estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls attributable to any particular group of properties classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially accordingly reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment and actual production revenue and expenditures with respect to the company’s reserves likely will vary possibly materially from estimates 

additionally because some of the company’s reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure in addition realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on the company’s development schedule and plans a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 

certain of the company’s undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage 

a sizeable portion of the company’s acreage is currently undeveloped unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms the leases will expire if the leases expire the company will lose its right to develop the related properties the company’s drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors including drilling results commodity prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs availability of drilling services and equipment gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 

risks related to counterparties 

the credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect the company 

the company is party to numerous transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including commercial banks investment banks insurance companies other investment funds and other institutions these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of the company’s current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to the company and their willingness to enter into future transactions with the company the company may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges the company also has exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under the company’s policies in addition if any lender under the company’s credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment the company’s liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under the credit facilities 

the company is exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract this risk of counterparty nonperformance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant changes in commodity prices which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract the company is unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform even if the company does accurately predict sudden changes its ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of the company’s hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that the company would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to it by the distressed entity or entities during periods of falling commodity prices the company’s hedge receivable positions increase which increases the company’s exposure if the creditworthiness of the counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance the company could incur a significant loss 

the distressed financial conditions of the company’s purchasers and partners have had and could have an adverse impact on the company in the event they are unable to pay the company for the products or services it provides or to reimburse it for their share of costs 

concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil natural gas and ngl prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry the company is exposed to risk of financial loss from trade joint venture joint interest billing and other receivables the company sells its crude oil natural gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers as operator the company pays expenses and bills its nonoperating partners for their respective shares of costs as a result of recent economic conditions and the previously severe decline in commodity prices some of the company’s customers and nonoperating partners experienced severe financial problems that had a significant impact on their creditworthiness the company cannot provide assurance that one or more of its financially distressed customers or nonoperating partners will not default on their obligations to the company or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of the company’s customers or nonoperating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint have made it and might make it unlikely that the company will or would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities nonperformance by a trade creditor or nonoperating partner could result in significant financial losses 

the company’s liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of its transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case 

from time to time the company has divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets the agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions indemnities escrows trusts bonds letters of credit and similar arrangements one of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by the company one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress in the event that any such counterparty becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11 of the united states code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law which are collectively referred to as insolvency laws the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions in that case the company’s remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not the company has collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations resolution of the company’s claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed and the company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise pending final resolution of the proceeding 

despite the provisions in the company’s agreements requiring purchasers of its state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations the company would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require it to perform and hold it responsible for such liabilities and obligations in such event the company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise 

if a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions or any similar determination or action it could adversely impact the company’s cash flows operations or financial condition 

for additional information regarding apache’s prior gulf of mexico properties and the bankruptcy of the purchaser of those properties see the information set forth under “potential obligation to decommission sold properties” in note 11—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

the company does not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations 

the company conducts many of its exploration and production ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which the company may not control decisions either because it does not have a controlling interest or is not an operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s and therefore decisions may be made that the company does not believe are in its best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations 

and the company may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of the investment may be adversely affected 

the company own an approximate 79 percent interest in altus which holds substantially all of apache’s former gathering processing and transmission assets in alpine high altus may be subject to different risks than those described in this annual report on form 10k 

the company owns an approximate 79 percent interest in altus which holds substantially all of apache’s former gathering processing and transmission assets in alpine high altus owns develops and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas anchored by midstream service contracts to service the company’s production from apache’s alpine high resource play altus generates revenue by providing feebased natural gas gathering compression processing and transmission services and through its equity method interest pipelines given the nature of its business altus may be subject to different and additional risks than those described in this annual report on form 10k for a description of these risks refer to altus’ most recently filed annual report on form 10k and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on form 10q 

on october 21 2021 altm announced that it will combine with privately owned bcp in an allstock transaction the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2022 following completion of customary closing conditions upon closing of the transaction the company will no longer control altus 

risks related to capital markets 

a downgrade in the company’s credit rating could negatively impact its cost of and ability to access capital 

the company receives debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the us factors that may impact the company’s credit ratings include its debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix commodity pricing levels and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies a ratings downgrade could adversely impact the company’s ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt during 2021 the company’s credit rating was affirmed by moody’s to ba1stable and by standard and poor’s to bbstable past ratings downgrades have required and any future downgrades may require the company to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations 

market conditions may restrict the company’s ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs which may limit its financial flexibility 

the financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks the company has a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio which will require substantial future investment the company andor its partners may need to seek financing to fund these or other future activities the company’s future access to capital as well as that of its partners and contractors could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained this could significantly delay development of the company’s property interests 

the company’s syndicated credit facility currently matures in march 2024 there is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future agreements will make loans or other extensions of credit available to the company or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders 

the discontinuation and uncertain cessation date of libor and the adoption of an alternative reference rate may have a material adverse impact on the company’s floating rate indebtedness and financing costs 

pursuant to the terms of the company’s revolving credit facility 1 the company may elect to use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings and 2 the commission payable to the lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit uses libor as a benchmark on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration iba announced that it intends to continue publishing libor until the end of june 2023 beyond the previously announced 2021 cessation date the iba announcement was supported by announcements from the uk’s financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor and the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal deposit insurance corporation and office of the comptroller of the currency us regulators however both the fca and us regulators in their announcements also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing libor after december 2021 these announcements indicate that the continuation of libor in existing contracts may not be assured after 2021 and will not be assured beyond 2023 in light of these recent announcements the future 

of libor at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or regulatory activity related to libor’s phaseout could cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist 

in the us the alternative reference rates committee the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to libor has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative rate for libor there can be no guarantee that sofr will become a widelyaccepted benchmark in place of libor although the full impact of the transition away from libor including the discontinuance of libor publication and the adoption of sofr as the replacement rate for libor remains unclear these changes may have an adverse impact on the company’s floating rate indebtedness and financing costs under its revolving credit facility 

the company’s ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations 

the payment of future dividends on the company’s capital stock is subject to the discretion of the company’s board of directors which considers among other factors the company’s operating results overall financial condition creditrisk considerations and capital requirements as well as general business and market conditions the board of directors is not required to declare dividends on apa’s common stock and may decide not to declare dividends 

any indentures and other financing agreements that the company enters into in the future may limit its ability to pay cash dividends on its capital stock including apa common stock in addition under delaware law dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus” which is the amount by which the fair value of the company’s total assets exceeds the sum of its total liabilities including contingent liabilities and the amount of its capital if there is no surplus cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from the company’s net profits for the thencurrent andor the preceding fiscal year further even if the company is permitted under its contractual obligations and delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock the company may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on its common stock 

unfavorable esg ratings and funding limitation initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the company and to the diversion of capital from the company’s industry 

organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters such ratings are used by some investors to inform and advise their investment and voting decisions in addition certain organizations and stakeholders may encourage lenders to limit funding to ep companies unfavorable esg ratings and funding limitation initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the company and to the diversion of capital from the company’s industry which could have a negative impact on the company’s access to and costs of capital 

risks related to financial results 

future economic conditions in the us and certain international markets may materially adversely impact the company’s operating results 

current global market conditions and uncertainty including economic instability in emerging markets are likely to have significant longterm effects on the company’s operating results global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources including fossil fuels a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for the company’s oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices which would reduce the company’s cash flows from operations and its profitability 

the company faces strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas ep industry the company competes with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases properties and reserves equipment and labor required to explore develop and operate those properties and marketing of crude oil natural gas and ngl production crude oil natural gas and ngl prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities many of the company’s competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than the company possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the company may seek new entry as a consequence the company may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of the company’s larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of 

government regulations the company also competes in attracting and retaining personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

the company’s ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income may be limited if the company experiences an ownership change 

as described in note 10—income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards nols and other tax attributes available to potentially offset future taxable income if the company were to experience an “ownership change” under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change by value in the company’s equity ownership by fivepercent shareholders over a threeyear period the company’s ability to utilize its prechange nols and other prechange tax attributes to potentially offset its postchange income or taxes may be limited such a limitation could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results or cash flows by effectively increasing its future tax obligations 

risks related to governmental regulation and political risks 

the company may incur significant costs related to environmental matters 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties the company is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages limit or constrain operations in affected areas and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas the company’s efforts to limit its exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to the company’s results of operations in addition it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require the company to make significant capital expenditures such capital expenditures could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and its financial condition 

the company’s us operations are subject to governmental risks 

the company’s us operations have been and at times in the future may be affected by political developments and by federal state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production changes in taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection laws and regulations 

in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the us gulf of mexico in april 2010 and as directed by the secretary of the us department of the interior the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety environmental matters drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the gulf of mexico these regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the gulf of mexico 

with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico the boem issued a notice to lessees ntl no 2016n01 significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases while the ntl was paused in mid2017 and is currently listed on boem’s website as “rescinded” if reinstated the ntl will likely require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations relating to apache’s current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases the company is working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security if such security becomes necessary under the ntl additionally the company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern 

new political developments the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting the company’s us operations and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact the company’s results of operations 

proposed federal state or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase the company’s operating and capital costs 

several proposals are before the us congress that if implemented would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation ballot initiatives executive orders or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting transparency and well construction requirements on hydraulicfracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity in addition some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities andor hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so the company routinely uses fracturing techniques in the us and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore it is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability 

although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which the company conducts business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the us 

changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the us federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration development and extraction may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial interpretation at any time previous legislative proposals if enacted into law could make significant changes to such laws including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas ep companies these changes include but are not limited to i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and iii an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures the passage or adoption of these changes or similar changes could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development the company is unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted any such changes could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to climate change 

changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact the company’s business 

certain countries where the company operates including the uk either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas ghg related fees on the company’s operations exposure has not been material to date although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect the company’s cash flows and results of operations additionally there has been discussion in other countries where the company operates including the us regarding legislation or regulation of ghg numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the national regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of ghgs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions moreover on january 27 2021 the president issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change calling for among other things the increased use of zeroemissions vehicles by the federal government the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry and increased emphasis on climaterelated risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors 

additionally various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as ghg capandtrade programs carbon taxes reporting and tracking programs restriction of emissions electric vehicle mandates and combustion engine phaseouts any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for oil natural gas and ngls additionally political litigation and financial risks related to climate change may result in curtailed refinery activity increased regulation or other adverse direct and indirect effects on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations for example there is a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector recently the federal reserve announced that it has joined the network for greening the financial system a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climaterelated risks in the financial sector 

any such legislation regulations or other regulatory initiatives if enacted or additional or increased taxes assessments or ghgrelated fees on the company’s operations could lead to increased operating expenses or cause the company to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications 

enhanced scrutiny on esg matters could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations 

enhanced scrutiny on esg matters related to among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change hydraulic fracturing waste disposal oil spills and explosions of natural gas transmission pipelines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens increased risk of litigation and adverse impacts on the company’s access to capital moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits the company requires to conduct its operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict the company’s ability to profitably conduct its business 

the company’s estimates used in various scenario planning analyses could differ materially from actual results and could expose us to new or additional risks 

in 2021 the company undertook a scenario planning analysis in alignment with recommendations of the financial stability board’s taskforce on climaterelated financial disclosures “tcfd” this expanded climatefocused scenario planning framework included forecasts of future demand and pricing in energy markets as well as changes in government regulations and policy given the dynamic nature of the company’s business the company generally performs annual scenario analyses with fiveyear time horizons when analyzing longerterm tcfd scenarios the company relies on external analysis for demand scenarios carbon pricing and comparisonpricing scenarios which are then compared to the company’s internally prepared basecase pricing analysis averaged out to 2040 given the numerous estimates that are required to run these scenarios the company’s estimates could differ materially from actual results additionally by electing to set and share publicly these metrics in the company’s sustainability report and the company’s commitment to expand upon its disclosures the company’s business may also face increased scrutiny related to esg initiatives as a result the company could damage its reputation if it fails to act responsibly in the areas in which it reports any harm to the company’s reputation resulting from setting these metrics expanding its disclosures or its failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics or disclosures could adversely affect the company’s business financial performance and growth 

the company operates in gulf coast wetlands which face threats from climate change and human activities 

a changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes both physical and financial to the areas in which the company operates including gulf coast wetlands for several decades the state of louisiana has lost an estimated 20 square miles of wetlands per year due to natural processes of subsidence saltwater intrusion and shoreline erosion as well as human activities such as levee construction along the mississippi river and the dredging of navigation canals a possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and major flooding events the risk of increased or more severe hurricanes or flooding events along or near the gulf coast could increase the company’s costs to repair damaged facilities and restore production additionally federal state and local laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to the company’s operations including i the limitation or prohibition of certain activities on wetlands ii the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations iii the reporting of the types and quantities of various substances that are generated stored processed or released in connection with protected properties and iv the installation of costly emission monitoring andor pollution control equipment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of the company’s operations in addition the company may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits which may delay or interrupt the company’s operations or specific projects and limit its growth and revenue 

the guidance upon which the company’s consumptive water use reporting was modified and could be revised in the future resulting in the over or underreporting of the company’s consumptive water use and could expose the company to financial risk 

based on ipieca’s sustainability reporting guidance of the oil and gas industry 2020 the company modified the way it reports its water data compared to previous years and also restated data from past years previously the company included produced water usage in its consumptive use calculations which led to an overreporting of consumptive water use based on reevaluation of water reporting definitions and guidance the company determined that produced water – nonpotable water 

released from deep underground formations and brought to the surface during oil and gas exploration and production – should not be classified as consumed in the same sense as fresh water produced water is generally not of the quality that most users would be able to utilize and is therefore not available for thirdparty usage outside of the oilfield the company’s revised reporting now reflects only fresh water and nonpotable water from surface water or shallow groundwater that are consumed in oil and gas operations 

the treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted and could expose the company to additional costs or limit certain operations 

the treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted the company’s ability to accurately report and track its water use is necessary for its continued ability to reuse and recycle water when possible while the company remains focused on reusing or recycling water over disposal of water the company’s costs for obtaining and disposing of water could increase significantly if reusing and recycling water becomes impractical further compliance with reporting and environmental regulations governing the withdrawal storage use and discharge of water may increase the company’s operating costs which could materially and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial conditions for example the railroad commission of texas rrc has been developing data associated with seismic activity particularly such activity related to injection wells used for produced water disposal in september 2021 the rrc began to limit saltwater disposal in the midland basin under what is known as a seismic response action or sar due to increased seismic activity these developments could result in restriction of disposal wells that could have a material effect on the company’s capital expenses and operating costs or limit production in certain areas 

risks related to international operations 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

the company’s operations outside the us are based primarily in egypt and the uk with significant exploration and appraisal activities offshore suriname on a barrel equivalent basis approximately 41 percent of the company’s 2021 production was outside the us and approximately 32 percent of the company’s estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of december 31 2021 were located outside the us as a result a significant portion of the company’s production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including but not limited to 

• general strikes and civil unrest 

• the risk of war acts of terrorism expropriation and resource nationalization and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts including through prospective or retroactive changes in the laws and regulations applicable to such contracts 

• import and export regulations 

• taxation policies including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims and investment restrictions 

• price control 

• transportation regulations and tariffs 

• constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area 

• exchange controls currency fluctuations devaluations or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds 

• laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade including trade sanctions 

• the longterm effects of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the british pound 

• the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where the company currently operates 

• the possible inability to subject foreign persons especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies to the jurisdiction of courts in the us and 

• difficulties in enforcing the company’s rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations 

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to the company by another country the company’s interests could decrease in value or be lost even the company’s smaller international assets may affect its overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from its more significant assets certain regions of the world in which the company operates have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as the company’s in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of the company’s assets this could adversely affect the company’s interests and its future profitability 

the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities as have occurred in countries and regions in which the company operates may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on the company’s operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war the company may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard its assets against terrorist activities 

a deterioration of conditions in egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in egypt could have an adverse impact on the company’s business

the company’s operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations 

the company’s operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the british pound the company’s financial statements presented in us dollars may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect the company’s results of operations particularly through the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies 

risks related to the holding company reorganization 

apa as the parent holding company of apache is dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries including apache 

as a result of the holding company reorganization apa became the successor issuer to and parent holding company of apache apa has no business operations of its own and its only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests of its subsidiaries including apache as a result apa relies on cash flows from its subsidiaries including apache to pay dividends with respect to apa’s common stock and to meet its financial obligations including to service any debt obligations that the company may incur from time to time legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing future indebtedness of apache as well as apache’s financial condition and future operating requirements may limit apache’s ability to distribute cash to the company if apache is limited in its ability to distribute cash to the company or if apache’s earnings or other available assets of are not sufficient to pay distributions or make loans to the company in the amounts or at the times necessary for it to pay dividends with respect to its common stock andor to meet its financial obligations then the company’s business financial condition cash flows results of operations and reputation may be materially adversely affected 

the company may not obtain the anticipated benefits of the reorganization into a holding company structure 

the company believes that its new operating structure will allow it to focus on running its diverse businesses independently with the goal of maximizing each of the business’ potential however the anticipated benefits of the holding company reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent the company from taking advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that it expects the structure may afford the company as a result the company may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

management is dedicating significant effort to the new operating structure these efforts may divert management’s focus and resources from the company’s operations strategic initiatives or development opportunities which could adversely affect the company’s prospects business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

general risk factors 

certain antitakeover provisions in the company’s charter and delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover 

the company’s charter authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights dividend rates liquidation preferences conversion rights redemption rights including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock in addition delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 percent or more of apa’s outstanding common stock these provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of the company that would have been financially beneficial to apa’s shareholders

• conduct business with honesty and integrity 

• we derive benefit from the earth and take our environmental responsibility seriously 

• treat stakeholders with respect and dignity 

• invest in our greatest asset our people 

• expect top performance and innovation 

• seek relentless improvement in all facets 

• drive to succeed with a sense of urgency 

• foster a contrarian spirit 

apa maintains a diversified asset portfolio including conventional and unconventional onshore and offshore exploration and production interests in the us apa operations are primarily focused in the permian basin of west texas and eastern new mexico with additional operations located in the eagle ford shale and austin chalk areas of southeast texas offshore in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast internationally the company has conventional onshore assets in egypt’s western desert offshore assets on the uk’s continental shelf an offshore appraisal and exploration program in suriname and an offshore exploration block in the dominican republic 

rigorous management of the company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long term over the past several years apa has entered into a series of transactions that have upgraded its portfolio of assets enhanced its capital allocation process to further optimize investment returns and increased focus on internally generated exploration with fullcycle returnsfocused growth management actively reviews certain nonstrategic assets for opportunities which include potential monetization of legacy properties and other noncore leasehold positions 

during 2021 the company made significant progress on key aspects of its portfolio specifically the company refreshed the economic foundation for its business in egypt with the announcement of the ratification of a modernized productionsharing contract psc with the egyptian ministry of petroleum and the egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc the new psc consolidates the majority of the company’s gross acreage and production in egypt into a single concession and refreshes existing development and exploration lease terms the modernized psc incentivizes increased investment and production growth and places egypt at the top of many attractive investment opportunities in apa’s global portfolio 

in october 2021 altus midstream company altm announced that it will combine with privately owned bcp raptor holdco lp bcp in an allstock transaction and apa’s ownership in altm will be reduced from approximately 79 percent to approximately 20 percent reducing apa’s interest in altus to a minority position will have a number of benefits to apa shareholders including simplification of its financial reporting and enhanced comparability with its upstreamonly peers while maintaining a noncontrolling interest in future growth opportunities 

the global economy and the energy industry have been deeply impacted by the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions uncertainty in the commodity and financial markets since early 2020 continue to impact oil supply and demand despite these uncertainties the company remains committed to its longerterm objectives 1 to maintain a balanced asset portfolio including advancement of ongoing exploration and appraisal activities offshore suriname 2 to invest for longterm returns over production growth and 3 to budget conservatively to generate cash flow in excess of its upstream exploration appraisal and development capital program that can be directed to debt reduction share repurchases and return of capital to its stakeholders the company continues to aggressively manage its cost structure regardless of the oil price environment and closely monitors hydrocarbon pricing fundamentals to reallocate capital as part of its ongoing planning process

business overview 

the following business overview further describes the operations and activities for the company’s upstream exploration and production properties by geographic region and altus midstream 

upstream exploration and production 

operating areas 

apa has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas the us egypt and offshore the uk in the north sea apa also has active exploration and appraisal operations ongoing in suriname as well as interests in other international locations that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities 

the following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key 2021 data for each of the company’s operating areas additional data and discussion are provided in part ii item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k 



1 the company’s operations in egypt excluding the impacts of a onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 22 percent of 2021 production and accounted for 16 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

2 sales volumes from the company’s north sea assets for 2021 were 161 mmboe sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the beryl field 

united states 

in 2021 the company’s us upstream oil and gas operations contributed approximately 59 percent of production and 68 percent of estimated yearend proved reserves consistent with prior years apa has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 38 million gross acres 18 million net acres in the us 75 percent of which are undeveloped 

the company’s us assets are primarily located in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico including the permian subbasins midland basin central basin platformnorthwest shelf and delaware basin examples of shale plays being developed within these subbasins include the woodford barnett pennsylvanian cline wolfcamp bone spring and spraberry apa is one of the largest operators in the permian basin operating approximately 6000 gross oil and gas wells across its acreage with additional interests in more than 3000 nonoperated wells of note approximately six percent of the company’s net acreage position in the permian basin is on federal onshore lands apa also has operations located in the eagle ford shale and austin chalk areas of southeast texas offshore in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast in south texas and louisiana 

highlights of the company’s operations in the us include 

• southern midland basin apa holds approximately 332000 gross acres 238000 net acres in the southern midland basin during 2021 the company averaged one rig targeting oil plays in the wolfcamp and spraberry formations drilling 49 gross development wells in this basin with a 100 percent success rate 

• delaware basin apa holds approximately 267000 gross acres 134000 net acres in the delaware basin including opportunities in the bone spring and other formations of eastern new mexico and bordering west texas and the alpine high play in the southern portion of the permian basin primarily in reeves county texas during 2021 the company focused on completing wells drilled from previous years and completed 27 gross development wells 

• legacy assets apa holds approximately 32 million gross acres 15 million net acres in legacy properties of which 11 million gross acres are in the offshore waters of the gulf of mexico legacy onshore properties are located primarily in the eagle ford shale and austin chalk areas of southeast texas the company participated in drilling 14 gross nonoperated development wells in these areas during 2021 the company also initiated a targeted drilling program on its austin chalk acreage where it will continue to evaluate and highgrade inventory opportunities consistent with the company’s broader portfolio management efforts certain nonstrategic leasehold positions on its legacy acreage holdings during the year were divested primarily in the central basin platform subbasin of the permian basin and additional monetization opportunities are continuing to be evaluated 

• new venture assets apa separately has undeveloped acreage positions across several states where it intends to pursue exploration interests and potential development opportunities over time 

• during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company announced that it has ended routine flaring in its us onshore operations achieving one of its announced 2021 environmental social and governance esg goals three months ahead of schedule 

with the improvement in commodity prices the company is returning to a modest level of activity in the us after halting all drilling and completion activity for most of 2020 in early 2021 the company reactivated one rig in the permian basin and one rig in the austin chalk a second rig was added in the permian basin in late june 2021 for 2022 the company will continue to budget its capital program at levels to fund activity necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved oil and natural gas reserves future rig activity levels and drilling targets will be dependent on the success of the company’s drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically 

us marketing in general most of the company’s us natural gas production is sold at either monthly or daily indexbased prices the tenor of the company’s sales contracts span from daily to multiyear transactions natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution utility and midstream companies as well as endusers marketers and integrated major oil companies apa strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk the company predominantly sells its natural gas production within the us including to us lng export facilities although a portion may be sold to markets in mexico 

apa primarily markets its us crude oil production to integrated major oil companies marketing and transportation companies and refiners based on west texas intermediate wti pricing indices eg wti houston west texas sour wts or wti midland and some predominately brent related international pricing indices adjusted for quality transportation and a marketreflective differential the company’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product sales contracts are generally 30day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party these contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices also from time to time the company will enter into physical term sales contracts these term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide an opportunity for higher than prevailing market prices 

apa’s us ngl production is sold under contracts with prices based on gulf coast supply and demand conditions less the costs for transportation and fractionation or on a weightedaverage sales price received by the purchaser 

us delivery commitments the company has longterm delivery commitments for natural gas and crude oil that require apa to deliver an average of 251 bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2022 through 2029 at variable marketbased pricing and deliver an average of 64 mmbbls of crude oil per year from 2022 through 2025 at variable marketbased pricing 

apa currently expects to fulfill its delivery commitments with production from its proved reserves production from continued development andor spot market purchases as necessary apa may also enter into contractual arrangements to reduce its delivery commitments the company has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its delivery commitments 

for more information regarding the company’s commitments please see part ii item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—capital resources and liquidity—contractual obligations of this annual report on form 10k 

international 

in 2021 international assets contributed 41 percent of apa’s production and 50 percent of oil and gas revenues approximately 32 percent of estimated proved reserves at yearend were located outside the us 

apa has two international locations with ongoing development and production operations 

• egypt which includes onshore conventional assets located in egypt’s western desert and 

• the north sea which includes offshore assets based in the uk 

the company also has an active offshore exploration program and appraisal operations ongoing in suriname and an offshore exploration block in the dominican republic 

egypt apa has 26 years of exploration development and operations experience in egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in egypt’s western desert at yearend 2021 the company held 53 million gross acres in egypt in six separate concessions but primarily held in a new single concession that resulted from the ratification of a modernized production sharing contract psc with the egyptian government as more fully described below development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 1 to 20 years with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis approximately 68 percent of the company’s gross acreage in egypt is undeveloped providing apa with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future 

apa’s egypt operations are conducted pursuant to pscs under the terms of the company’s pscs the company is the contractor partner contractor with egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc and bears the risk and cost of exploration development and production activities in return if exploration is successful the contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery additionally the contractor’s income taxes which remain the liability of the contractor under domestic law are paid by egpc on behalf of the contractor out of egpc’s production entitlement income taxes paid to the arab republic of egypt on behalf of the contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and are reflected as production and estimated reserves because contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices in addition because the contractor income taxes are paid by egpc the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on the company’s egypt operations despite impacting the company’s production and reserves 

on december 27 2021 the company announced the ratification of a modernized psc with egpc having an effective date of april 1 2021 the new psc consolidates 98 percent of gross acreage and 90 percent of gross production into a single concession and refreshes the existing development lease terms for 20 years and exploration leases for 5 years the consolidated concession has a single cost recovery pool to provide improved access to cost recovery a fixed 40 percent cost recovery limit and a fixed profitsharing rate of 30 percent for all the company’s production covered under the new concession the apa subsidiary that became the sole contractor under the psc is owned by an apaoperated joint venture owned twothirds by the company and onethird by sinopec international petroleum exploration and production corporation sinopec 

the company’s estimated proved reserves in egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves through the joint venture sinopec holds a onethird minority participation interest in the company’s oil and gas operations in egypt the company’s egypt assets including the onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 30 percent of 2021 production and 21 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves excluding the impacts of the noncontrolling interest egypt contributed 22 percent of 2021 production and 16 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

in 2021 the company drilled 30 gross development and 24 gross exploration wells in egypt a key component of the company’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3d seismic surveys that enable the company’s technical teams to consistently highgrade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the cretaceous jurassic and deeper paleozoic formations the company has completed seismic surveys covering over 3 million acres to date and continues to build and enhance its drilling inventory in egypt supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations on both new and existing acreage 

for 2022 the company plans to increase activity to a 15 rig drilling program for the year and increase well completions by approximately three times compared to 2021 with a goal of growing gross oil production 13 to 15 percent 

north sea the company has interests in approximately 494000 gross acres in the uk north sea these assets contributed 11 percent of the company’s 2021 production and approximately 11 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

the company entered the north sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the forties field forties since acquiring forties the company has actively invested in these assets and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of 4d seismic building upon its success in forties in 2011 the company acquired mobil north sea limited providing the company with additional exploration and development opportunities in the north sea across numerous fields including operated interests in the beryl ness nevis nevis south skene and buckland fields and a nonoperated interest in the maclure field the company also has a nonoperated interest in the nelson field acquired in 2011 the beryl field which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential provides for significant exploration opportunity the north sea assets play a strategic role in apa’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with highimpact exploration potential near existing infrastructure 

during 2021 the company averaged two rigs in the north sea and drilled 4 gross development and two gross exploration wells production was significantly impacted by compressor downtime extended platform turnaround work and thirdparty outage during 2021 

in 2022 the expected capital program for the north sea remains relatively unchanged from the prior year with one floating rig and one platform crew 

international marketing the company’s natural gas production in egypt is sold to egpc primarily under an industrypricing formula a sliding scale based on dated brent crude oil with a minimum of 150 per mmbtu and a maximum of 265 per mmbtu plus an upward adjustment for liquids content crude oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to egpc when called upon to supply domestic demand oil production sold to third parties is sold and exported from one of two terminals on the northern coast of egypt oil production sold to egpc is sold at prices related to the export market  

the company’s north sea crude oil production is sold under term entitlement volume contracts and spot variable volume contracts with a marketbased index price plus a differential to capture the higher market value under each type of arrangement natural gas from the beryl field is processed through the scottish area gas evacuation sage gas plant operated by ancala midstream acquisitions limited natural gas is sold to a third party at the st fergus entry point of the national grid on a national balancing point index price basis the condensate mix from the sage plant is processed further downstream the split streams of propane butane and condensate are sold separately on a monthly entitlement basis at the braefoot bay terminal using index pricing less transportation 

other exploration 

new ventures apa’s international new ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the company’s traditional core areas and targeting higherrisk higherreward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins 

in december 2019 the company entered into a joint venture agreement with totalenergies formerly total sa to explore and develop block 58 offshore suriname the company holds a 50 percent working interest in block 58 which comprises approximately 14 million gross acres in water depths ranging from less than 100 meters to more than 2100 meters starting in late 2019 and throughout 2020 the company drilled the first three wells in the block the maka central1 sapakara west1 and kwaskwasi1 all of which successfully tested for the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper cretaceousaged campanian and santonian intervals encountering both oil and gas condensate 

in january 2021 apa and totalenergies announced the fourth consecutive discovery in block 58 at keskesi east1 which confirmed oil in the eastern portion of the block in accordance with the joint venture agreement the company transferred operatorship of block 58 to totalenergies on january 1 2021 totalenergies holds a 50 percent working interest in block 58 as the operator with an active appraisal and exploration program budgeted for 2022 

the company is also a 45 percent working interest holder in suriname on block 53 where technical work completed in 2021 has led to the resumption of exploration activities an exploration well is planned for early 2022 with partners cepsa and petronas who have a 25 percent and 30 percent working interest respectively 

apa also holds an offshore exploration block in the dominican republic 

drilling statistics 

worldwide in 2021 apa drilled or participated in drilling 166 gross wells with 145 wells 87 percent completed as producers historically apa’s drilling activities in the us have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration as a general matter the company’s operations outside of the us focus on a mix of exploration and development wells in addition to wells completed at yearend a number of wells had not yet reached completion 53 gross 417 net in the us 22 gross 220 net in egypt 1 gross 1 net in the north sea and 1 gross 05 net in suriname 

the following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years 



productive oil and gas wells 

the number of productive oil and gas wells operated and nonoperated in which the company had an interest as of december 31 2021 is set forth below 



gross natural gas and crude oil wells include 494 wells with multiple completions 

production pricing and lease operating cost data 

the following table describes for each of the last three fiscal years oil ngl and gas production volumes average lease operating costs per boe including transportation costs but excluding severance and other taxes and average sales prices for each of the countries where the company has operations 



1 includes production volumes attributable to a onethird noncontrolling interest in egypt 

2 sales volumes from the company’s north sea assets for 2021  2020 and 2019 were 161 mmboe 227 mmboe and 218 mmboe respectively sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the beryl field 

gross and net undeveloped and developed acreage 

the following table summarizes the company’s gross and net acreage position as of december 31 2021 



as of december 31 2021 the company held 636000 net undeveloped acres that are scheduled to expire by yearend 2022 if production is not established or the company takes no action to extend the terms the company also held 10000 and 97000 net undeveloped acres set to expire by yearend 2023 and 2024 respectively the company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the company and third parties including governments no oil and gas reserves were recorded on this undeveloped acreage set to expire 

exploration concessions in the company’s egypt asset were extended upon ratification of the modernized psc with the egpc and no acreage is scheduled to expire over the next three years the company will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist 

additionally the company has exploration interests in block 53 and block 58 offshore suriname and offshore the dominican republic approximately 390000 net undeveloped acres in block 53 are set to expire in 2022 contingent on planned drilling activity the company also continues to assess contract and potentially explore undeveloped acreage positions in other international locations 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 93 percent of us net undeveloped acreage was held by production or owned as undeveloped mineral rights 

estimated proved reserves and future net cash flows 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas crude oil condensate and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods the company reports all estimated proved reserves held under productionsharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method which excludes the host country’s share of reserves 

estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed the costs of the operation reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been fieldtested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation in estimating its proved reserves apa uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy with similar properties the company will at times utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models petrophysical techniques and proprietary 3d seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the company’s reserve estimates 

proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period 

the following table shows proved oil ngl and gas reserves as of december 31 2021 based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2021 held flat for the life of the production except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms the total column of this table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl this ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products 



1 includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of 62 mmboe and 4 mmboe respectively attributable to a onethird noncontrolling interest in egypt

competitive conditions 

the oil and gas industry is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves the acquisition of oil and gas leases equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves and the gathering and marketing of oil gas and ngls the company’s competitors include national oil companies major integrated oil and gas companies other independent oil and gas companies and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial commercial and individual consumers 

certain of the company’s competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than the company possesses or have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the company may seek new entry as a consequence the company may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights 

however the company believes its diversified portfolio of core assets which comprises large acreage positions and wellestablished production bases across three geographic areas its balanced production mix between oil and gas its management and incentive systems and its experienced personnel give it a strong competitive position relative to many of the company’s competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity the company’s global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which it has producing operations to which it can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices local business environments and markets this also reduces the risk that the company will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country 

environmental compliance 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities the company is subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole the company does not believe that these requirements affect it differently to any material degree than other companies in the oil and gas industry 

the company has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with these requirements which the company believes are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry the company has established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations including regulations applicable to its operations in all countries in which it does business the company has established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of its field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations the costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that the company is unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters however the company does not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 



the company’s business activities and the value of its securities are subject to significant hazards and risks including those described below if any of such events should occur the company’s business financial condition liquidity andor results of operations could be materially harmed and holders and purchasers of apa’s securities could lose part or all of their investments additional risks relating to the company’s securities may be included in the prospectus supplements related to offerings of such securities from time to time in the future 

risks related to pricing demand and production for crude oil natural gas and ngls 

the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact the company’s business financial condition and results of operations the global economy and the demand for and prices of oil natural gas and ngls the unprecedented nature of the current situation makes it impossible for the company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business 

the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic have adversely impacted the global economy and created significant volatility in the global financial markets business closures restrictions on travel “stayathome” or “shelterinplace” orders and other restrictions on movement within and among communities have significantly reduced demand for and the prices of oil natural gas and ngls as of the date of this annual report on form 10k efforts to contain covid19 have not been successful in many regions vaccination distribution programs have encountered delays new variants have emerged and the global pandemic remains ongoing while some geographic regions have lifted relaxed or otherwise modified their pandemic response measures to lessen the impact of such measures on business operations and commerce these regions may reinstitute restrictions as circumstances change a continued prolonged period or a renewed period of reduced demand the failure to timely distribute or the ineffectiveness of or reluctance or refusal of individuals to take any vaccines the failure to develop adequate treatments and other adverse impacts from the pandemic may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

the company’s operations rely on its workforce being able to access its wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with its oil and gas leases additionally because the company has previously implemented and may elect to or be required in the future to reimplement remote working procedures for a significant portion of its workforce for health and safety reasons andor to comply with applicable national state andor local government requirements the company relies on such persons having sufficient access to its information technology systems including through telecommunication hardware software and networks if a significant portion of the company’s workforce cannot effectively perform their responsibilities whether resulting from a lack of physical or virtual access quarantines illnesses governmental actions or restrictions including vaccine mandates and the reactions thereto information technology or telecommunication failures or other restrictions or adverse impacts resulting from the pandemic the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the unprecedented nature of the current situation resulting from the covid19 pandemic makes it impossible for the company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business financial condition cash flows or results of operations such results will depend on future events which the company cannot predict including the scope duration and potential reoccurrence of the covid19 pandemic the emergence and impact of covid19 variants or any other localized epidemic or global pandemic the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines therapeutics and treatments the demand for and the prices of oil natural gas and ngls and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities customers contractors and suppliers in response to the covid19 pandemic or any other epidemics or pandemics the covid19 pandemic and its unprecedented consequences have amplified and may continue to amplify the other risks identified in this annual report on form 10k 

crude oil natural gas and ngl price volatility could adversely affect the company’s operating results and the price of apa’s common stock 

the company’s revenues operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices it receives for its crude oil natural gas and ngl production historically the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future for example the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2021 ranged from a high of 8564 per barrel to a low of 4747 per barrel the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2021 ranged from a high of 2386 per mmbtu to a low of 243 per mmbtu the market prices for 

crude oil natural gas and ngls depend on factors beyond the company’s control these factors include demand which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors including 

• worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil natural gas and ngls 

• actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations including the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec 

• political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions 

• the occurrence of global events such as epidemics or pandemics including specifically the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities customers contractors and suppliers in response to such epidemics or pandemics 

• the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories 

• the price and level of imported foreign crude oil natural gas and ngls 

• the price and availability of alternative fuels including coal and biofuels 

• the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure 

• the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity 

• weather conditions 

• the impact of political pressure and the influence of environmental groups and other stakeholders on decisions and policies related to the industries in which the company and its affiliates operate 

• domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes including legislative regulatory policy changes or initiatives and addressing the impact of global climate change hydraulic fracturing methane emissions flaring or water disposal and 

• the overall economic environment 

the company’s results of operations as well as the carrying value of its oil and gas properties are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil natural gas and ngls low prices have previously adversely affected and could again adversely affect the company’s revenues operating income cash flow and proved reserves and continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations and limit its ability to fund capital expenditures without the ability to fund capital expenditures the company would be unable to replace reserves and production sustained low prices of crude oil natural gas and ngls may further adversely impact the company’s business as follows 

• weakening the company’s financial condition and reducing its liquidity 

• limiting the company’s ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations 

• reducing the amount of crude oil natural gas and ngls that the company can produce economically 

• causing the company to delay or postpone some of its capital projects 

• reducing the company’s revenues operating income and cash flows 

• limiting the company’s access to sources of capital such as equity and longterm debt 

• reducing the carrying value of the company’s oil and gas properties resulting in additional noncash impairments or 

• reducing the carrying value of the company’s gathering processing and transmission facilities resulting in additional impairments 

the company’s ability to sell crude oil natural gas or ngls andor receive market prices for these commodities andor meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints the inability to procure and resell volumes economically and various transportation interruptions 

a portion of the company’s crude oil natural gas and ngl production in any region may be interrupted limited or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons including as a result of weather conditions accidents loss of pipeline or gathering system access field labor issues or strikes or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering 

systems processing facilities or interstate pipelines to transport the company’s production or the company might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions if a substantial amount of the company’s production is interrupted at the same time it could temporarily adversely affect the company’s cash flows additionally if the company is unable to procure and resell thirdparty volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation the company’s cash flows could be adversely affected 

the company may not realize an adequate return on wells that it drills 

drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks including the risk that the company will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the wells the company drills or participates in may not be productive and the company may not recover all or any portion of its investment in those wells the seismic data and other technologies the company uses do not allow it to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically the costs of drilling completing and operating wells are often uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

• unexpected drilling conditions 

• pressure or irregularities in formations 

• equipment failures or accidents 

• fires explosions blowouts and surface cratering 

• marine risks such as capsizing collisions and hurricanes 

• other adverse weather conditions and 

• increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment 

future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure could have an adverse effect on the company’s future results of operations and financial condition while all drilling whether developmental or exploratory involves these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

the company’s commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent it from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose it to other risks 

to the extent that the company engages in price risk management activities to protect itself from commodity price declines the company may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk in addition the company’s hedging arrangements may expose it to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which 

• the company’s production falls short of the hedged volumes 

• there is a widening of pricebasis differentials between delivery points for the company’s production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement 

• the counterparties to the company’s hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements or 

• an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices 

risks related to operations and development projects 

the company’s operations involve a high degree of operational risk particularly risk of personal injury damage to or loss of equipment and environmental accidents 

the company’s operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling production and transportation of crude oil natural gas and ngls including 

• well blowouts explosions fires and cratering 

• pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills 

• formations with abnormal pressures 

• equipment malfunctions 

• hurricanes major storms and cyclones which could affect the company’s operations in areas such as on and offshore the gulf coast north sea and suriname and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions and 

• surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents saltwater or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives 

failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions cyberattacks or natural disasters such as hurricanes could result in property damages personal injury environmental pollution and other damages for which the company could be liable litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence such as a well blowout explosion fire at a location where the company’s equipment and services are used or ground water contamination from chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing may result in substantial claims for damages ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses if a significant amount of the company’s production is interrupted containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence the company’s cash flows and in turn its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on the company’s revenues and production 

demand for oil and natural gas are to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impact the price the company receives for the commodities it produces in addition the company’s exploration development and production activities and equipment have been and can be adversely affected by severe weather such as freezing temperatures hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or major storms in the north sea which have previously caused and may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment the company’s planning for normal climatic variation insurance programs and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions and not all such effects can be predicted eliminated or insured against 

the company’s insurance policies do not cover all of the risks the company faces which could result in significant financial exposure 

exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and ngls can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts cratering fires explosions and loss of well control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment the company’s international operations are also subject to political risk the insurance coverage that the company maintains against certain losses or liabilities arising from its operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability moreover insurance is not available to the company against all operational risks 

a terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by the company or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact the company’s operations 

the company’s business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development and production activities the company depends on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves process and record financial and operating data analyze seismic and drilling information communicate with personnel and thirdparty partners and conduct many of the company’s activities unauthorized access to the company’s digital technology could lead to operational disruption data corruption communication interruption loss of intellectual property loss of confidential and fiduciary data and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information also external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the us and abroad which are necessary to transport and market the company’s production a cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems have previously and could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions any such terrorist attack environmental activist group activity or cyberattack that affects the company or its customers suppliers or others with whom it does business could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business cause it to incur a material financial loss subject it to possible legal claims and liability andor damage its reputation 

while certain of the company’s insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events if the company were to incur a significant liability for which it was not fully insured that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur 

while the company has experienced cyberattacks in the past it has not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks however there is no assurance that the company will not suffer such losses in the future further as cyberattacks continue to evolve the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in addition cyberattacks against the company or others in its industry could result in additional regulations which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures the company cannot predict the potential impact that such additional regulations could have on its business and operations or the energy industry at large 

material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects 

the company is involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond the company’s anticipated completion dates these projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies weather conditions manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment and other unforeseen events delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect the company’s large development projects and its ability to participate in largescale development projects in the future in addition the company’s estimates of future development costs are based on its current expectations of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel the company will need to implement such projects the actual future development costs may be significantly higher than the company currently estimates if costs become too high the development projects may become uneconomic to the company and it may be forced to abandon such development projects 

risks related to reserves and leasehold acreage 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rate from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted while related perunit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore unless the company adds reserves through exploration and development activities identifies additional behindpipe zones secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies or acquires additional properties containing proved reserves the company’s estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced future oil and gas production is therefore highly dependent upon the company’s level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis furthermore as oil or natural gas prices increase the company’s cost for additional reserves could also increase 

the company may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves 

although the company performs a review of properties that it acquires which the company believes is consistent with industry practices such reviews are inherently incomplete it generally is not feasible to review indepth every individual property involved in each acquisition ordinarily the company will focus its review efforts on the highervalue properties and will sample the remainder however even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor will it permit the company as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the company often assumes certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates in addition there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon the company’s operating results particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into the company’s ongoing operations 

crude oil natural gas and ngl reserves are estimates and actual recoveries may vary significantly 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil natural gas and ngl reserves and their value reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil natural gas and ngls that cannot be measured in an exact manner because of the high degree of judgment involved the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation the company’s reserves estimates are based on 12month average prices except where contractual arrangements exist therefore 

reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease in addition results of drilling testing and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time the estimates of the company’s proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results including 

• historical production from the area compared with production from other areas 

• the effects of regulations by governmental agencies including changes to severance and excise taxes 

• future operating costs and capital expenditures and 

• workover and remediation costs 

for these reasons estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls attributable to any particular group of properties classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially accordingly reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment and actual production revenue and expenditures with respect to the company’s reserves likely will vary possibly materially from estimates 

additionally because some of the company’s reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure in addition realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on the company’s development schedule and plans a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 

certain of the company’s undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage 

a sizeable portion of the company’s acreage is currently undeveloped unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms the leases will expire if the leases expire the company will lose its right to develop the related properties the company’s drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors including drilling results commodity prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs availability of drilling services and equipment gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 

risks related to counterparties 

the credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect the company 

the company is party to numerous transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including commercial banks investment banks insurance companies other investment funds and other institutions these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of the company’s current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to the company and their willingness to enter into future transactions with the company the company may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges the company also has exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under the company’s policies in addition if any lender under the company’s credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment the company’s liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under the credit facilities 

the company is exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract this risk of counterparty nonperformance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant changes in commodity prices which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract the company is unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform even if the company does accurately predict sudden changes its ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of the company’s hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that the company would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to it by the distressed entity or entities during periods of falling commodity prices the company’s hedge receivable positions increase which increases the company’s exposure if the creditworthiness of the counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance the company could incur a significant loss 

the distressed financial conditions of the company’s purchasers and partners have had and could have an adverse impact on the company in the event they are unable to pay the company for the products or services it provides or to reimburse it for their share of costs 

concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil natural gas and ngl prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry the company is exposed to risk of financial loss from trade joint venture joint interest billing and other receivables the company sells its crude oil natural gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers as operator the company pays expenses and bills its nonoperating partners for their respective shares of costs as a result of recent economic conditions and the previously severe decline in commodity prices some of the company’s customers and nonoperating partners experienced severe financial problems that had a significant impact on their creditworthiness the company cannot provide assurance that one or more of its financially distressed customers or nonoperating partners will not default on their obligations to the company or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of the company’s customers or nonoperating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint have made it and might make it unlikely that the company will or would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities nonperformance by a trade creditor or nonoperating partner could result in significant financial losses 

the company’s liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of its transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case 

from time to time the company has divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets the agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions indemnities escrows trusts bonds letters of credit and similar arrangements one of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by the company one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress in the event that any such counterparty becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11 of the united states code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law which are collectively referred to as insolvency laws the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions in that case the company’s remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not the company has collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations resolution of the company’s claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed and the company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise pending final resolution of the proceeding 

despite the provisions in the company’s agreements requiring purchasers of its state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations the company would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require it to perform and hold it responsible for such liabilities and obligations in such event the company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise 

if a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions or any similar determination or action it could adversely impact the company’s cash flows operations or financial condition 

for additional information regarding apache’s prior gulf of mexico properties and the bankruptcy of the purchaser of those properties see the information set forth under “potential obligation to decommission sold properties” in note 11—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

the company does not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations 

the company conducts many of its exploration and production ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which the company may not control decisions either because it does not have a controlling interest or is not an operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s and therefore decisions may be made that the company does not believe are in its best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations 

and the company may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of the investment may be adversely affected 

the company own an approximate 79 percent interest in altus which holds substantially all of apache’s former gathering processing and transmission assets in alpine high altus may be subject to different risks than those described in this annual report on form 10k 

the company owns an approximate 79 percent interest in altus which holds substantially all of apache’s former gathering processing and transmission assets in alpine high altus owns develops and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas anchored by midstream service contracts to service the company’s production from apache’s alpine high resource play altus generates revenue by providing feebased natural gas gathering compression processing and transmission services and through its equity method interest pipelines given the nature of its business altus may be subject to different and additional risks than those described in this annual report on form 10k for a description of these risks refer to altus’ most recently filed annual report on form 10k and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on form 10q 

on october 21 2021 altm announced that it will combine with privately owned bcp in an allstock transaction the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2022 following completion of customary closing conditions upon closing of the transaction the company will no longer control altus 

risks related to capital markets 

a downgrade in the company’s credit rating could negatively impact its cost of and ability to access capital 

the company receives debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the us factors that may impact the company’s credit ratings include its debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix commodity pricing levels and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies a ratings downgrade could adversely impact the company’s ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt during 2021 the company’s credit rating was affirmed by moody’s to ba1stable and by standard and poor’s to bbstable past ratings downgrades have required and any future downgrades may require the company to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations 

market conditions may restrict the company’s ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs which may limit its financial flexibility 

the financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks the company has a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio which will require substantial future investment the company andor its partners may need to seek financing to fund these or other future activities the company’s future access to capital as well as that of its partners and contractors could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained this could significantly delay development of the company’s property interests 

the company’s syndicated credit facility currently matures in march 2024 there is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future agreements will make loans or other extensions of credit available to the company or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders 

the discontinuation and uncertain cessation date of libor and the adoption of an alternative reference rate may have a material adverse impact on the company’s floating rate indebtedness and financing costs 

pursuant to the terms of the company’s revolving credit facility 1 the company may elect to use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings and 2 the commission payable to the lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit uses libor as a benchmark on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration iba announced that it intends to continue publishing libor until the end of june 2023 beyond the previously announced 2021 cessation date the iba announcement was supported by announcements from the uk’s financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor and the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal deposit insurance corporation and office of the comptroller of the currency us regulators however both the fca and us regulators in their announcements also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing libor after december 2021 these announcements indicate that the continuation of libor in existing contracts may not be assured after 2021 and will not be assured beyond 2023 in light of these recent announcements the future 

of libor at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or regulatory activity related to libor’s phaseout could cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist 

in the us the alternative reference rates committee the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to libor has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative rate for libor there can be no guarantee that sofr will become a widelyaccepted benchmark in place of libor although the full impact of the transition away from libor including the discontinuance of libor publication and the adoption of sofr as the replacement rate for libor remains unclear these changes may have an adverse impact on the company’s floating rate indebtedness and financing costs under its revolving credit facility 

the company’s ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations 

the payment of future dividends on the company’s capital stock is subject to the discretion of the company’s board of directors which considers among other factors the company’s operating results overall financial condition creditrisk considerations and capital requirements as well as general business and market conditions the board of directors is not required to declare dividends on apa’s common stock and may decide not to declare dividends 

any indentures and other financing agreements that the company enters into in the future may limit its ability to pay cash dividends on its capital stock including apa common stock in addition under delaware law dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus” which is the amount by which the fair value of the company’s total assets exceeds the sum of its total liabilities including contingent liabilities and the amount of its capital if there is no surplus cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from the company’s net profits for the thencurrent andor the preceding fiscal year further even if the company is permitted under its contractual obligations and delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock the company may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on its common stock 

unfavorable esg ratings and funding limitation initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the company and to the diversion of capital from the company’s industry 

organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters such ratings are used by some investors to inform and advise their investment and voting decisions in addition certain organizations and stakeholders may encourage lenders to limit funding to ep companies unfavorable esg ratings and funding limitation initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the company and to the diversion of capital from the company’s industry which could have a negative impact on the company’s access to and costs of capital 

risks related to financial results 

future economic conditions in the us and certain international markets may materially adversely impact the company’s operating results 

current global market conditions and uncertainty including economic instability in emerging markets are likely to have significant longterm effects on the company’s operating results global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources including fossil fuels a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for the company’s oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices which would reduce the company’s cash flows from operations and its profitability 

the company faces strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas ep industry the company competes with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases properties and reserves equipment and labor required to explore develop and operate those properties and marketing of crude oil natural gas and ngl production crude oil natural gas and ngl prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities many of the company’s competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than the company possesses and have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the company may seek new entry as a consequence the company may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of the company’s larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of 

government regulations the company also competes in attracting and retaining personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

the company’s ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income may be limited if the company experiences an ownership change 

as described in note 10—income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards nols and other tax attributes available to potentially offset future taxable income if the company were to experience an “ownership change” under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change by value in the company’s equity ownership by fivepercent shareholders over a threeyear period the company’s ability to utilize its prechange nols and other prechange tax attributes to potentially offset its postchange income or taxes may be limited such a limitation could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results or cash flows by effectively increasing its future tax obligations 

risks related to governmental regulation and political risks 

the company may incur significant costs related to environmental matters 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties the company is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages limit or constrain operations in affected areas and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas the company’s efforts to limit its exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to the company’s results of operations in addition it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require the company to make significant capital expenditures such capital expenditures could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and its financial condition 

the company’s us operations are subject to governmental risks 

the company’s us operations have been and at times in the future may be affected by political developments and by federal state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production changes in taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection laws and regulations 

in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the us gulf of mexico in april 2010 and as directed by the secretary of the us department of the interior the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety environmental matters drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the gulf of mexico these regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the gulf of mexico 

with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico the boem issued a notice to lessees ntl no 2016n01 significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases while the ntl was paused in mid2017 and is currently listed on boem’s website as “rescinded” if reinstated the ntl will likely require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations relating to apache’s current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases the company is working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security if such security becomes necessary under the ntl additionally the company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern 

new political developments the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting the company’s us operations and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact the company’s results of operations 

proposed federal state or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase the company’s operating and capital costs 

several proposals are before the us congress that if implemented would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation ballot initiatives executive orders or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting transparency and well construction requirements on hydraulicfracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity in addition some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities andor hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so the company routinely uses fracturing techniques in the us and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore it is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability 

although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which the company conducts business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the us 

changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the us federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration development and extraction may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial interpretation at any time previous legislative proposals if enacted into law could make significant changes to such laws including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas ep companies these changes include but are not limited to i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and iii an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures the passage or adoption of these changes or similar changes could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development the company is unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted any such changes could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to climate change 

changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact the company’s business 

certain countries where the company operates including the uk either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas ghg related fees on the company’s operations exposure has not been material to date although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect the company’s cash flows and results of operations additionally there has been discussion in other countries where the company operates including the us regarding legislation or regulation of ghg numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the national regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of ghgs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions moreover on january 27 2021 the president issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change calling for among other things the increased use of zeroemissions vehicles by the federal government the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry and increased emphasis on climaterelated risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors 

additionally various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as ghg capandtrade programs carbon taxes reporting and tracking programs restriction of emissions electric vehicle mandates and combustion engine phaseouts any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for oil natural gas and ngls additionally political litigation and financial risks related to climate change may result in curtailed refinery activity increased regulation or other adverse direct and indirect effects on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations for example there is a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector recently the federal reserve announced that it has joined the network for greening the financial system a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climaterelated risks in the financial sector 

any such legislation regulations or other regulatory initiatives if enacted or additional or increased taxes assessments or ghgrelated fees on the company’s operations could lead to increased operating expenses or cause the company to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications 

enhanced scrutiny on esg matters could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations 

enhanced scrutiny on esg matters related to among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change hydraulic fracturing waste disposal oil spills and explosions of natural gas transmission pipelines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens increased risk of litigation and adverse impacts on the company’s access to capital moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits the company requires to conduct its operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict the company’s ability to profitably conduct its business 

the company’s estimates used in various scenario planning analyses could differ materially from actual results and could expose us to new or additional risks 

in 2021 the company undertook a scenario planning analysis in alignment with recommendations of the financial stability board’s taskforce on climaterelated financial disclosures “tcfd” this expanded climatefocused scenario planning framework included forecasts of future demand and pricing in energy markets as well as changes in government regulations and policy given the dynamic nature of the company’s business the company generally performs annual scenario analyses with fiveyear time horizons when analyzing longerterm tcfd scenarios the company relies on external analysis for demand scenarios carbon pricing and comparisonpricing scenarios which are then compared to the company’s internally prepared basecase pricing analysis averaged out to 2040 given the numerous estimates that are required to run these scenarios the company’s estimates could differ materially from actual results additionally by electing to set and share publicly these metrics in the company’s sustainability report and the company’s commitment to expand upon its disclosures the company’s business may also face increased scrutiny related to esg initiatives as a result the company could damage its reputation if it fails to act responsibly in the areas in which it reports any harm to the company’s reputation resulting from setting these metrics expanding its disclosures or its failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics or disclosures could adversely affect the company’s business financial performance and growth 

the company operates in gulf coast wetlands which face threats from climate change and human activities 

a changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes both physical and financial to the areas in which the company operates including gulf coast wetlands for several decades the state of louisiana has lost an estimated 20 square miles of wetlands per year due to natural processes of subsidence saltwater intrusion and shoreline erosion as well as human activities such as levee construction along the mississippi river and the dredging of navigation canals a possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and major flooding events the risk of increased or more severe hurricanes or flooding events along or near the gulf coast could increase the company’s costs to repair damaged facilities and restore production additionally federal state and local laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to the company’s operations including i the limitation or prohibition of certain activities on wetlands ii the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations iii the reporting of the types and quantities of various substances that are generated stored processed or released in connection with protected properties and iv the installation of costly emission monitoring andor pollution control equipment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of the company’s operations in addition the company may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits which may delay or interrupt the company’s operations or specific projects and limit its growth and revenue 

the guidance upon which the company’s consumptive water use reporting was modified and could be revised in the future resulting in the over or underreporting of the company’s consumptive water use and could expose the company to financial risk 

based on ipieca’s sustainability reporting guidance of the oil and gas industry 2020 the company modified the way it reports its water data compared to previous years and also restated data from past years previously the company included produced water usage in its consumptive use calculations which led to an overreporting of consumptive water use based on reevaluation of water reporting definitions and guidance the company determined that produced water – nonpotable water 

released from deep underground formations and brought to the surface during oil and gas exploration and production – should not be classified as consumed in the same sense as fresh water produced water is generally not of the quality that most users would be able to utilize and is therefore not available for thirdparty usage outside of the oilfield the company’s revised reporting now reflects only fresh water and nonpotable water from surface water or shallow groundwater that are consumed in oil and gas operations 

the treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted and could expose the company to additional costs or limit certain operations 

the treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted the company’s ability to accurately report and track its water use is necessary for its continued ability to reuse and recycle water when possible while the company remains focused on reusing or recycling water over disposal of water the company’s costs for obtaining and disposing of water could increase significantly if reusing and recycling water becomes impractical further compliance with reporting and environmental regulations governing the withdrawal storage use and discharge of water may increase the company’s operating costs which could materially and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial conditions for example the railroad commission of texas rrc has been developing data associated with seismic activity particularly such activity related to injection wells used for produced water disposal in september 2021 the rrc began to limit saltwater disposal in the midland basin under what is known as a seismic response action or sar due to increased seismic activity these developments could result in restriction of disposal wells that could have a material effect on the company’s capital expenses and operating costs or limit production in certain areas 

risks related to international operations 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

the company’s operations outside the us are based primarily in egypt and the uk with significant exploration and appraisal activities offshore suriname on a barrel equivalent basis approximately 41 percent of the company’s 2021 production was outside the us and approximately 32 percent of the company’s estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of december 31 2021 were located outside the us as a result a significant portion of the company’s production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including but not limited to 

• general strikes and civil unrest 

• the risk of war acts of terrorism expropriation and resource nationalization and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts including through prospective or retroactive changes in the laws and regulations applicable to such contracts 

• import and export regulations 

• taxation policies including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims and investment restrictions 

• price control 

• transportation regulations and tariffs 

• constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area 

• exchange controls currency fluctuations devaluations or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds 

• laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade including trade sanctions 

• the longterm effects of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the british pound 

• the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where the company currently operates 

• the possible inability to subject foreign persons especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies to the jurisdiction of courts in the us and 

• difficulties in enforcing the company’s rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations 

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to the company by another country the company’s interests could decrease in value or be lost even the company’s smaller international assets may affect its overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from its more significant assets certain regions of the world in which the company operates have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as the company’s in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of the company’s assets this could adversely affect the company’s interests and its future profitability 

the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities as have occurred in countries and regions in which the company operates may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on the company’s operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war the company may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard its assets against terrorist activities 

a deterioration of conditions in egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in egypt could have an adverse impact on the company’s business 

deterioration in the political economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the egyptian government such as changes in laws or regulations export restrictions expropriation of the company’s assets or resource nationalization andor forced renegotiation or modification of the company’s existing contracts with egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations the company’s operations in egypt excluding the impacts of a onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 22 percent of the company’s 2021 production and accounted for 16 percent of the company’s yearend estimated proved reserves and 20 percent of the company’s estimated discounted future net cash flows 

the company’s operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations 

the company’s operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the british pound the company’s financial statements presented in us dollars may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect the company’s results of operations particularly through the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies 

risks related to the holding company reorganization

as a result of the holding company reorganization apa became the successor issuer to and parent holding company of apache apa has no business operations of its own and its only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests of its subsidiaries including apache as a result apa relies on cash flows from its subsidiaries including apache to pay dividends with respect to apa’s common stock and to meet its financial obligations including to service any debt obligations that the company may incur from time to time legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing future indebtedness of apache as well as apache’s financial condition and future operating requirements may limit apache’s ability to distribute cash to the company if apache is limited in its ability to distribute cash to the company or if apache’s earnings or other available assets of are not sufficient to pay distributions or make loans to the company in the amounts or at the times necessary for it to pay dividends with respect to its common stock andor to meet its financial obligations then the company’s business financial condition cash flows results of operations and reputation may be materially adversely affected 

the company may not obtain the anticipated benefits of the reorganization into a holding company structure 

the company believes that its new operating structure will allow it to focus on running its diverse businesses independently with the goal of maximizing each of the business’ potential however the anticipated benefits of the holding company reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent the company from taking advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that it expects the structure may afford the company as a result the company may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

management is dedicating significant effort to the new operating structure these efforts may divert management’s focus and resources from the company’s operations strategic initiatives or development opportunities which could adversely affect the company’s prospects business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

general risk factors 

certain antitakeover provisions in the company’s charter and delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover 

the company’s charter authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights dividend rates liquidation preferences conversion rights redemption rights including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock in addition delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 percent or more of apa’s outstanding common stock these provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of the company that would have been financially beneficial to apa’s shareholders

on january 4 2021 apache corporation announced plans to implement a holding company reorganization the holding company reorganization which was thereafter completed on march 1 2021 in connection with the holding company reorganization apache corporation became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of apa corporation and all of apache corporation’s outstanding shares were automatically converted into equivalent corresponding shares of apa corporation pursuant to the holding company reorganization apa corporation became the successor issuer to apache corporation pursuant to rule 12g3a under the exchange act and replaced apache corporation as the public company trading on the nasdaq global select market under the ticker symbol “apa” the holding company reorganization modernized the company’s operating and legal structure to more closely align with its growing international presence making it more consistent with other companies that have subsidiaries operating around the globe 

overview 

apa is an independent energy company that explores for develops and produces natural gas crude oil and natural gas liquids ngls the company’s upstream business currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas the us egypt and offshore the uk in the north sea north sea apa also has active exploration and appraisal operations ongoing in suriname as well as interests in other international locations that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities the company’s midstream business altus midstream is operated by altus midstream company nasdaq altm through its subsidiary altus midstream lp collectively altus altus owns develops and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas 

apa believes energy underpins global progress and the company wants to be a part of the conversation and solution as society works to meet growing global demand for reliable and affordable energy today the world faces a dual challenge to meet growing demand for energy and to do so in a cleaner more sustainable way apa believes society can accomplish both and strives to meet those challenges while creating value for all its stakeholders 

the global economy and the energy industry have been deeply impacted by the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions uncertainties in the commodity and financial markets since early 2020 continue to impact oil supply and demand despite these uncertainties the company remains committed to its longerterm objectives 1 to maintain a balanced asset portfolio including advancement of ongoing exploration and appraisal activities offshore suriname 2 to invest for longterm returns over production growth and 3 to budget conservatively to generate cash flow in excess of its upstream exploration appraisal and development capital program that can be directed to debt reduction share repurchases and other return of capital to its stakeholders the company continues to aggressively manage its cost structure regardless of the oil price environment and closely monitors hydrocarbon pricing fundamentals to reallocate capital as part of its ongoing planning process for additional detail on the company’s forward capital investment outlook refer to “capital and operational outlook” below 

during 2021 the company reported net income attributable to common stock of 973 million or 259 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 49 billion or 1286 per diluted share in 2020 net income in 2021 benefited from significantly improved commodity prices that had collapsed in the prior year when the covid19 pandemic negatively affected economic activity and the oil markets in 2020 the company recorded impairments totaling 45 billion in connection with fair value assessments stemming from the global crude oil price collapse 

the company generated 35 billion of cash from operating activities in 2021 which was 21 billion or 152 percent higher than the prior year apa’s higher operating cash flows for 2021 were driven by higher crude oil and natural gas prices and associated revenues the company ended the year with a cash balance of 302 million up 40 million from yearend 2020 after paying back nearly 14 billion of debt during 2021 in an effort to reduce nearterm debt maturities and strengthening its balance sheet 

following this progress and considering the ongoing constructive price environment the company initiated a capital return framework for our shareholders as follows 

• the company implemented a capital return framework during 2021 for equity holders to participate more directly and materially in cash returns the company believes returning 60 percent of cash flow over capital investment creates a good balance for providing nearterm cash returns to shareholders while still recognizing the importance of longerterm balance sheet strengthening

purchased oil and gas sales 

purchased oil and gas sales represent volumes primarily attributable to transport fuel and physical inbasin gas purchases that were sold by the company to fulfill natural gas takeaway obligations sales related to these purchased volumes increased 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 from 398 million to 15 billion purchased oil and gas sales were offset by associated purchase costs of 16 billion and 357 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase is the result of sales volume growth associated with additional transport capacity and a more than doubling of the average gas sales price 

operating expenses 

the table below presents a comparison of the company’s operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 all operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in egypt and altus

during 2021 loe increased 114 million or 10 percent compared to 2020 on a perboe basis loe increased 175 or 25 percent compared to 2020 from 700 per boe to 875 per boe the increase in costs was driven by maintenance and turnaround costs in the north sea higherpriced emissions credits purchased in association with north sea production increased workover activity in the us operating costs trending with commodity prices inflation impacts and overall higher labor costs that were heavily impacted by marktomarket adjustments for stockbased compensation 

gathering processing and transmission gpt 

gpt expenses include amounts paid to thirdparty carriers and to altus midstream for gathering and transmission services for the company’s upstream natural gas production associated with its alpine high play gpt expenses also include midstream operating costs incurred by altus midstream the following table presents a summary of these expenses 



gpt costs decreased 10 million compared to 2020 thirdparty processing and transmission costs decreased 4 million primarily driven by a decrease in contracted pricing and lower processed volumes midstream service affiliate costs decreased 15 million compared to 2020 primarily driven by lower throughput of natural gas volumes at alpine high midstream operating expenses incurred primarily by altus decreased 6 million compared to 2020 driven by continued improvements in operational efficiency as a result of transitioning from mechanical refrigeration units to altus’ centralized diamond cryogenic complex the transition resulted in decreases in contract labor equipment rentals and chemical expenses

exploration expenses decreased 119 million compared to 2020 unproved leasehold impairments were 70 million lower than the prior year due to improved commodity prices and increased drilling plans in the us dry hole expense decreased 44 million geological and geophysical expenses decreased 2 million and exploration overhead and other expenses decreased 3 million compared to 2020 primarily resulting from decreased exploration activities compared to the prior year 

general and administrative ga expenses 

ga expenses increased 86 million compared to 2020 primarily driven by higher cashbased stock compensation expense resulting from an increase in the company’s stock price compared to the prior year partially offset by lower overhead driven by organizational redesign efforts during 2019 and 2020 

transaction reorganization and separation trs costs 

trs costs decreased 32 million compared to 2020 primarily driven by costs associated with the company’s reorganization efforts incurred primarily in the prior year

capital and operational outlook 

the company continues to prudently manage its capital program against a volatile price environment and the prolonged effects of the covid19 pandemic despite these uncertainties the company remains committed to its longerterm objectives 1 to maintain a balanced asset portfolio including advancement of ongoing exploration and appraisal activities offshore suriname 2 to invest for longterm returns over production growth and 3 to budget conservatively to generate cash flow in excess of its upstream exploration appraisal and development capital program that can be directed to debt reduction share repurchases and return of capital to its stakeholders 

the company’s 2022 capital program will maintain a similar investment approach to the prior year with upstream capital investment budgeted at approximately 16 billion this budget includes small changes to the timing of rig count increases in egypt and the us as well as updated views on costs and inflation this amount also includes approximately 200 million for exploration and appraisal activities primarily in suriname in 2023 and 2024 the total capital budget is anticipated to increase slightly despite a relatively unchanged activity set given expectations of continued inflationary pressure 

based on this planned capital activity the company anticipates 2022 worldwide production levels will be similar to 2021 after adjusting for divestments egypt gross production is expected to increase through the year with higher rig activity while egypt net production will be additionally benefited from the effects of the modernized psc terms the company anticipates moderate production declines in the us compared to 2021 given gradual increases in activity levels over the past year and timing of completions 

at current strip pricing the company expects to generate significant cash flow over this capital activity budget the company’s commitment to return capital to shareholders over the next three years will remain unchanged

capital resources and liquidity 

operating cash flows are the company’s primary source of liquidity the company’s shortterm and longterm operating cash flows are impacted by highly volatile commodity prices as well as production costs and sales volumes significant changes in commodity prices impact the company’s revenues earnings and cash flows these changes potentially impact the company’s liquidity if costs do not trend with related changes in commodity prices historically costs have trended with commodity prices albeit on a lag sales volumes also impact cash flows however they have a less volatile impact in the short term 

the company’s longterm operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of the company’s drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the company recognized upward reserve revisions of approximately 10 percent of its yearend 2020 estimated proved reserves as a result of improved commodity prices compared to negative reserve revisions of approximately 7 percent in the prior year as a result of lower commodity prices the company’s estimates of proved reserves proved developed reserves and pud reserves as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in note 18—supplemental oil and gas disclosures unaudited in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

the company believes its available liquidity and capital resource alternatives combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows will be adequate to fund shortterm and longterm operations including the company’s capital development program repayment of debt maturities payment of dividends share buyback activity and amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies 

the company may also elect to utilize available cash on hand committed subsidiary borrowing capacity access to both debt and equity capital markets or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs

the company is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation the company’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations including approximately 2 million for environmental remediation and approximately 84 million for various contingent legal liabilities for a detailed discussion of the company’s lease obligations purchase obligations environmental and legal contingencies and other commitments please see note 11—commitments and contingencies and note 12—retirement and deferred compensation plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

as further described above under “capital and operational outlook” altus midstream lp andor its subsidiaries have equity ownership in four equity method interest pipelines altus midstream lp andor its subsidiaries may be required to fund future capital expenditures for its equity interest share in the development of the applicable pipeline altus estimates that it will incur minimal capital contributions for its equity interests in these joint venture pipelines during 2022 

with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico the bureau of ocean energy management boem issued a notice to lessees ntl no 2016n01 significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases while the ntl was paused in mid2017 and is currently listed on boem’s website as “rescinded” if reinstated the ntl will likely require that the company provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations relating to the company’s current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases the company is working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security if such security becomes necessary under the ntl additionally the company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which the company has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom the company has joint ownership such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern 

potential decommissioning obligations on sold properties 

the company’s subsidiaries have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties the company has divested various leases wells and facilities located in the gulf of mexico gom where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug abandon and decommission the associated wells structures and facilities acquired one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern if a purchaser of such gom assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations apa’s subsidiaries could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations in such event such subsidiaries may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise 

in 2013 apache sold its gom shelf operations and properties and its gom operating subsidiary gom shelf llc gom shelf to fieldwood energy llc fieldwood under the terms of the purchase agreement apache received cash consideration of 375 billion and fieldwood assumed the obligation to decommission the properties held by gom shelf and the properties acquired from apache and its other subsidiaries collectively the legacy gom assets in respect of such abandonment obligations fieldwood posted letters of credit in favor of apache letters of credit and established trust accounts trust a and trust b of which apache was a beneficiary and which were funded by two net profits interests npis depending on future oil prices on february 14 2018 fieldwood filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in connection with the 2018 bankruptcy fieldwood confirmed a plan under which apache agreed inter alia to i accept bonds in exchange for certain of the letters of credit and ii amend the trust a trust agreement and one of the npis to consolidate the trusts into a single trust trust a funded by both remaining npis currently apache holds two bonds bonds and five letters of credit backed by investmentgrade counterparties to secure fieldwood’s asset retirement obligations on the legacy gom assets as and when apache is required to perform or pay for decommissioning any legacy gom asset over the remaining life of the legacy gom assets 

on august 3 2020 fieldwood again filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code on june 25 2021 the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas houston division entered an order confirming fieldwood’s bankruptcy plan on august 27 2021 fieldwood’s bankruptcy plan became effective pursuant to the plan the legacy gom assets were separated into a standalone company which was subsequently merged into gom shelf under gom shelf’s limited liability company agreement the proceeds of production of the legacy gom assets will be used to fund decommissioning of legacy gom assets 

in september 2021 gom shelf notified the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee that it was unable to fund the decommissioning obligations that it is currently required to perform on certain of the legacy gom assets as a result apache and other current and former owners in these assets have received orders from bsee to decommission certain of the legacy gom assets included in gom shelf’s notification to bsee apache expects to receive such orders on the other legacy gom assets included in gom shelf’s notification letter further apache anticipates that gom shelf may send additional such notices to bsee in the future and that it may receive additional orders from bsee requiring it to decommission other legacy gom assets 

if apache incurs costs to decommission any legacy gom asset and gom shelf does not reimburse apache for such costs then apache will obtain reimbursement from trust a the bonds and the letters of credit until such funds and securities are fully utilized in addition after such sources have been exhausted apache has agreed to provide a standby loan to gom shelf of up to 400 million to perform decommissioning standby loan agreement with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the legacy gom assets 

if the combination of gom shelf’s net cash flow from its producing properties the trust a funds the bonds and the remaining letters of credit are insufficient to fully fund decommissioning of any legacy gom assets that apache may be ordered by bsee to perform or if gom shelf’s net cash flow from its remaining producing properties after the trust a funds bonds and letters of credit are exhausted is insufficient to repay any loans made by apache under the standby loan agreement then apache may be forced to effectively use its available cash to fund the deficit 

as of december 31 2021 apache estimates that its potential liability to fund decommissioning of legacy gom assets it may be ordered to perform ranges from 12 billion to 14 billion on an undiscounted basis management does not believe any specific estimate within this range is a better estimate than any other accordingly during 2021 the company recorded a contingent liability of 12 billion representing the estimated costs of decommissioning it may be required to perform on legacy gom assets of the total liability recorded 11 billion is reflected under the caption “decommissioning contingency for sold gulf of mexico properties” and 100 million is reflected under “other current liabilities” in the company’s consolidated balance sheet the company also recorded a 740 million asset which represents the amount the company expects to be reimbursed from the trust a funds the bonds and the letters of credit for decommissioning it may be required to perform on legacy gom assets of the total asset recorded 640 million is reflected under the caption “decommissioning security for sold gulf of mexico properties” and 100 million is reflected under “other current assets” a “loss on previously sold gulf of mexico properties” in the amount of 446 million was recognized in the third quarter of 2021 to reflect the net impact to the company’s statement of consolidated operations changes in significant assumptions impacting apache’s estimated liability including expected decommissioning rig spread rates lift boat rates and planned abandonment logistics could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued in addition significant changes in the market price of oil gas and ngls could further impact apache’s estimate of its contingent liability to decommission legacy gom assets 

insurance program 

the company maintains insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to its assets general liabilities workers’ compensation employers’ liability sudden and accidental pollution and other risks the company’s insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that it must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance additionally the company’s insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations there is no assurance that insurance will adequately protect the company against liability from all potential consequences and damages further the company does not have coverage in place for a variety of other risks including gulf of mexico named windstorm and business interruption service agreements including drilling contracts generally indemnify the company for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider 

the company purchases multiyear political risk insurance from the islamic corporation for the insurance of investment and export credit trade iciec an agency of the islamic development bank and highlyrated insurers covering a portion of its investments in egypt for losses arising from confiscation nationalization and expropriation risks in the aggregate these insurance policies provide up to 750 million of coverage subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately 500 million 

the company also has an insurance policy with us international development finance corporation dfc which subject to policy terms and conditions provides up to 150 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from 1 nonpayment by egpc of arbitral awards covering amounts owed the company on past due invoices and 2 expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of egypt prevent the company from exporting its share of production the multilateral investment guarantee agency miga a member of the world bank group provides 60 million in reinsurance to dfc 

future insurance coverage for the company’s industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable or unavailable on terms economically acceptable 

critical accounting estimates 

the company prepares its financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes the company identifies certain accounting policies involving estimation as critical accounting estimates based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity as well as the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their deployment critical accounting estimates address accounting matters that are inherently uncertain due to unknown future resolution of such matters management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each critical accounting estimate the following is a discussion of the company’s most critical accounting estimates 

reserves estimates 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas crude oil condensate and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions operating conditions and government regulations 

proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless specific circumstances justify a longer time 

despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates the company’s reserves are used throughout its financial statements for example since the company uses the unitsofproduction method to amortize its oil and gas properties the quantity of reserves could significantly impact dda expense a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments finally these reserves are the basis for the company’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures for more information regarding the company’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures refer to note 18—supplemental oil and gas disclosures unaudited in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous twelve months held flat for the life of the production except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation 

the company has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing 

oil and gas exploration costs 

the company accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are also capitalized oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized or suspended pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found on a quarterly basis management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations otherwise the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized 

offshore decommissioning contingency 

the company has potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties for information regarding a potential obligation to decommission sold properties estimated and recorded in the third quarter of 2021 please refer to “potential obligation to decommission sold properties” above and in note 11—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv item 5 of this annual report on form 10k changes in significant assumptions impacting the company’s estimated liability including expected decommissioning rig spread rates lift boat rates and planned abandonment logistics could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued in addition significant changes in the market price of oil gas and ngls could further impact the company’s estimate of its contingent liability to decommission legacy gom assets 

impairment of equity method interests 

equity method interests are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred if the loss is deemed to be other than temporary when the loss is deemed to be other than temporary the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in income 

altus recorded an impairment charge on its equity method interest in epic in the fourth quarter of 2021 the fair value of the impaired interest was determined using the income approach the income approach considered estimates of future throughput volumes tariff rates and costs these assumptions were applied to develop future cash flow projections that were then discounted to estimated fair value using a discount rate believed to be consistent with that which would be applied by market participants the company has classified this nonrecurring fair value measurement as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy refer to note 6 —equity method interests  within part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further details of altus’ equity method interests negative revisions in future estimates of throughput volumes revenue assumptions or costs related to the altus’ equity method interests could lead to further impairments of such interests in future periods 

longlived asset impairments 

longlived assets used in operations including proved oil and gas properties and gpt assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets if there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recovered the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices volumes and future development plans are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach 

under the income approach the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs proved reserves the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves expected throughput volumes for gpt assets discount rates and other variables key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date and estimates of operating administrative and capital costs adjusted for inflation the company discounts the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants 

to assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate when available management uses a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets this requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets recent comparable asset transactions and transaction premiums 

although the fair value estimate of each asset group is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ from the estimate negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities increases in future cost estimates divestiture of a significant component of the asset group or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of longlived assets in future periods 

over the past several years the company has experienced substantial volatility in commodity prices which impacted its future development plans and operating cash flows as such material impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering processing and transmission facilities were recorded in 2020 and 2019 for discussion of these impairments see “fair value measurements” of note 1—summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

asset retirement obligation aro 

the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations the company’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the north sea and gulf of mexico estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public relations considerations 

aro associated with retiring tangible longlived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement removal site reclamation and similar activities associated with the company’s oil and gas properties and other longlived assets the company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts inflation factors creditadjusted discount rates timing of settlement and changes in the legal regulatory environmental and political environments accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value 

income taxes 

the company’s oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements and tax returns management routinely assesses the ability to realize the company’s deferred tax assets if management concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 

the company regularly assesses and if required establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates the company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position these accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits case law and any new legislation the company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about the company’s exposure to market risk the term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses the forwardlooking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 

commodity price risk 

the company’s revenues earnings cash flow capital investments and ultimately future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices the company receives for its crude oil natural gas and ngls which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction weather political climate and global supply and demand these factors have only been heightened as the implications of the covid19 pandemic became more apparent the company continually monitors its market risk exposure including the impact and developments related to the covid19 pandemic which introduced significant volatility in the financial markets beginning in early 2020 

the company’s average crude oil realizations increased 74 percent to 6897 per barrel in 2021 from 3960 per barrel in 2020 the company’s average natural gas price realizations increased 118 percent to 399 per mcf in 2021 from 183 per mcf in 2020 the company’s average ngl realizations increased 141 percent to 2848 per barrel in 2021 from 1184 per barrel in 2020 based on average daily production for 2021 a 100 per barrel change in the weighted average realized oil price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately 66 million a 010 per mcf change in the weighted average realized price of natural gas would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately 30 million and a 100 per barrel change in the weighted average realized ngl price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately 25 million 

the company periodically enters into derivative positions on a portion of its projected crude oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices such derivative positions may include the use of futures contracts swaps andor options the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes as of december 31 2021 the company had open natural gas derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges in a liability position with a fair value of approximately 10 million a 10 percent increase in basis differential of the hedges would increase the liability by approximately 30 million while a 10 percent decrease in basis differential of the hedges would move the derivatives to an asset position of approximately 21 million these fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters as of december 31 2021 refer to note 4—derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report form 10k for notional volumes and terms with the company’s derivative contracts 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2021 apache had 63 billion net in outstanding notes and debentures all of which was fixedrate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 507 percent although nearterm changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of fixedrate debt such changes do not expose the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss associated with that debt the company is also exposed to interest rate risk related to its interestbearing cash and cash equivalents balances and amounts outstanding under the apache and altus midstream lp credit facilities as of december 31 2021 the company had approximately 302 million in cash and cash equivalents approximately 57 percent of which was invested in money market funds and shortterm investments with major financial institutions as of december 31 2021 there were 542 million and 657 million of borrowings outstanding under the apache corporation and altus midstream lp revolving credit facilities respectively a change in the interest rate applicable to shortterm investments and credit facility borrowings would have an immaterial impact on earnings and cash flows but could impact interest costs associated with future debt issuances or any future borrowings 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company’s cash activities relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies the company’s north sea production is sold under us dollar contracts while the majority of costs incurred are paid in british pounds the company’s egypt production is primarily sold under us dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred are denominated in us dollars transactions denominated in british pounds are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period 

foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month foreign currency gains and losses are included as either a component of “other” under “revenues and other” or as is the case when the company remeasures its foreign tax liabilities as a component of the company’s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations a foreign currency net gain or loss of 3 million would result from a 10 percent weakening or strengthening respectively in the british pound as of december 31 2021 

the company is subject to increased foreign currency risk associated with the effects of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union the company has periodically entered into foreign exchange contracts in order to minimize the impact of fluctuating exchange rates for the british pound on the company’s operating expenses as of december 31 2021 the company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a total notional amount of £180 million that are used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for the british pound a 10 percent strengthening of the british pound against the us dollar would result in a foreign currency net gain of 20 million while a 10 percent weakening of the british pound against the us dollar would result in a loss of 14 million as of december 31 2021

business strategy 

our vision is to be the premier exploration and production company contributing to global progress by helping meet the world’s energy needs 

our mission is to grow in an innovative safe environmentally responsible and profitable manner for the longterm benefit of our stakeholders 

our strategy is to take a differentiated approach to the exploration and production of costadvantaged hydrocarbons through innovation technology optimization continuous improvement and relentless focus on costs to deliver toptier longterm returns 

rigorous management of the company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long term over the past several years apache has entered into a series of transactions that have upgraded its portfolio of assets enhanced its capital allocation process to further optimize investment returns and increased focus on internally generated exploration with fullcycle returnsfocused growth these efforts included the monetization of certain nonstrategic assets including gasweighted properties in the midcontinentgulf coast region and selling other noncore leasehold positions the company made strategic decisions to allocate the proceeds of these divestitures to more impactful development opportunities across its portfolio and exploration efforts in suriname in addition in november 2018 the company completed a transaction with altus midstream company and its then whollyowned subsidiary altus midstream lp to create a publiclytraded midstream ccorporation 

apache’s us upstream oil and gas assets are complemented by its international assets in egypt and the north sea each of which adds to the company’s inventory of exploration and development opportunities apache’s diverse international portfolio and asset inventory includes at scale both conventional and unconventional resources covering crude oil rich natural gas with ngls and lean natural gas 

during 2020 the global economy and the energy industry were deeply impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related thirdparty actions uncertainty in the oil markets and the negative demand implications resulting from the covid19 pandemic continue to weigh on commodity prices as with previous changes in a volatile price environment apache has continued to respond quickly and decisively taking the following strategic actions 

• establishing and implementing a wide range of fitforpurpose protocols and procedures to ensure a safe and productive work environment across the company’s diversified global onshore and offshore operations 

• reducing upstream capital investments by over 50 percent from the comparative prioryear period including eliminating nearly all us drilling and completion activity by may 2020 and reducing planned activity in egypt and the north sea 

• decreasing the company’s dividend by 90 percent beginning in the first quarter of 2020 preserving approximately 340 million of cash flow on an annualized basis and strengthening liquidity 

• completing an organizational redesign focused on centralizing certain operational activities in an effort to capture greater efficiencies achieving an estimated cost savings of 400 million annually 

• conducting on a continuous basis price sensitivity analyses and operational evaluations of producing wells across the company’s portfolio that allow for a methodical and integrated approach to production shutins and curtailments with a focus on preserving cash flows in a distressed price environment and protecting the company’s assets 

the company remains committed to its longerterm objectives 1 to maintain a balanced asset portfolio including advancement of ongoing exploration and appraisal activities offshore suriname 2 to invest for longterm returns over production growth and 3 to budget conservatively to generate excess cash flow that can be directed on a priority basis to debt reduction

business overview 

the following business overview further describes the operations and activities for the company’s upstream exploration and production properties by geographic region and altus midstream 

upstream exploration and production 

operating areas 

apache has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas the us egypt and the north sea apache also has active exploration and planned appraisal operations ongoing in suriname as well as interests in other international locations that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities during 2020 as a result of the company’s organizational redesign apache shifted from a regionbased structure to a centralized structure focused on core asset groups and functions in each country 

the following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key 2020 data for each of apache’s operating areas additional data and discussion are provided in part ii item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k 



1 apache’s operations in egypt excluding the impacts of a onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 20 percent of 2020 production and accounted for 15 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

2 sales volumes from the north sea for 2020 were 227 mmboe sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the beryl field 

united states 

in 2020 apache’s us upstream oil and gas operations contributed approximately 58 percent of production and 67 percent of estimated yearend proved reserves apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 49 million gross acres 25 million net acres in the us 78 percent of which are undeveloped 

the company’s us assets are primarily located in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico including the permian subbasins midland basin central basin platformnorthwest shelf and delaware basin examples of shale plays being developed within these subbasins include the woodford barnett pennsylvanian cline wolfcamp bone spring and spraberry apache is one of the largest operators in the permian basin operating more than 7000 gross oil and gas wells across its acreage with additional interests in over 4000 nonoperated wells approximately six percent of the company’s net acreage position in the permian basin is on federal onshore lands apache also has operations located in and along the gulf of mexico in the areas onshore and offshore south texas and louisiana 

highlights of the company’s operations in the us include 

• southern midland basin apache holds approximately 360000 gross acres 256000 net acres in the southern midland basin the company began the year operating four rigs but suspended drilling and completion activity in may in response to collapsing commodity prices during 2020 the company averaged one rig targeting oil plays in the wolfcamp spraberry and lower cline formations drilling 33 gross development wells in this basin with a 100 percent success rate 

• delaware basin apache holds approximately 370000 gross acres 220000 net acres in the delaware basin including opportunities in the bone spring and other formations of eastern new mexico and bordering west texas and the alpine high play in the southern portion of the permian basin primarily in reeves county texas the company began the year operating three rigs but suspended drilling in may during 2020 the company averaged one rig drilling 19 gross development wells with a 95 percent success rate primarily targeting oil plays in the bone spring formation 

• legacy assets apache holds approximately 36 million gross acres 17 million net acres in legacy properties primarily in the central basin platform subbasin of the permian basin the eagle ford shale and austin chalk areas of southeast texas and in the offshore waters of the gulf of mexico and onshore louisiana the company participated in drilling eight gross nonoperated development wells in these areas during 2020 although operated drilling activity was minimal during 2020 the company continued to evaluate and highgrade inventory opportunities on its austin chalk acreage the company also monetized certain nonstrategic leasehold positions on its legacy acreage holdings during the year and is continuing to evaluate additional opportunities 

• new venture assets apache separately has undeveloped acreage positions across several states where it intends to pursue exploration interests and potential development opportunities over time 

with the improvement in oil prices the company is returning to a modest level of activity in the us for 2021 the company is currently running one drilling rig in the permian basin and plans to add a second rig in the middle of the year in addition the company recently added a rig in the austin chalk oil play to retain core acreage positions and perform targeted tests the company also resumed completions activity in the permian basin during the fourth quarter of 2020 and began completing previously drilled but uncompleted wells in response to significantly lower service costs as with prior periods the company will continue to monitor commodity prices and will adjust its capital budget accordingly to protect its cash flows 

us marketing in general most of the company’s us natural gas production is sold at either monthly or daily indexbased prices the tenor of the company’s sales contracts span from daily to multiyear transactions natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution utility and midstream companies as well as endusers marketers and integrated major oil companies apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk apache predominantly sells its natural gas production within the united states including to us lng export facilities although a portion is sold to markets in mexico 

apache primarily markets its us crude oil production to integrated major oil companies marketing and transportation companies and refiners based on west texas intermediate wti pricing indices eg wti houston west texas sour wts or wti midland and some predominately brent related international pricing indices adjusted for quality transportation and a marketreflective differential apache’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product sales contracts are generally 30day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party these contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices also from time to time the company will enter into physical term sales contracts these term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide an opportunity for higher than prevailing market prices 

apache’s us ngl production is sold under contracts with prices based on gulf coast supply and demand conditions less the costs for transportation and fractionation or on a weightedaverage sales price received by the purchaser 

us delivery commitments the company has longterm delivery commitments for natural gas and crude oil which require apache to deliver an average of 232 bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2021 through 2029 at variable marketbased pricing and deliver an average of 68 mmbbls of crude oil per year from 2020 through 2025 at variable marketbased pricing 

apache currently expects to fulfill its delivery commitments with production from its proved reserves production from continued development andor spot market purchases as necessary apache may also enter into contractual arrangements to reduce its delivery commitments the company has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its delivery commitments 

for more information regarding the company’s commitments please see part ii item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—capital resources and liquidity—contractual obligations of this annual report on form 10k 

international 

in 2020 international assets contributed 42 percent of apache’s production and 56 percent of oil and gas revenues approximately 33 percent of estimated proved reserves at yearend were located outside the us 

apache has two international locations with ongoing development and production operations 

• egypt which includes onshore conventional assets located in egypt’s western desert and 

• the north sea which includes offshore assets based in the united kingdom 

the company also has an active offshore exploration program and planned appraisal operations ongoing in suriname 

egypt apache has 25 years of exploration development and operations experience in egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in egypt’s western desert at yearend 2020 the company held 52 million gross acres in 24 separate concessions development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 1 to 20 years with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis approximately 68 percent of the company’s gross acreage in egypt is undeveloped providing apache with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future 

apache’s egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts pscs under the terms of the company’s pscs the contractor partner contractor bears the risk and cost of exploration development and production activities in return if exploration is successful the contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery additionally the contractor’s income taxes which remain the liability of the contractor under domestic law are paid by egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc on behalf of the contractor out of egpc’s production entitlement income taxes paid to the arab republic of egypt on behalf of the contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves because contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices in addition because the contractor income taxes are paid by egpc the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on apache’s egypt operations despite impacting apache’s production and reserves 

the company’s estimated proved reserves in egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves in addition sinopec international petroleum exploration and production corporation sinopec holds a onethird minority participation interest in apache’s oil and gas operations in egypt apache’s egypt assets including the onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 28 percent of 2020 production and 20 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves excluding the impacts of the noncontrolling interest egypt contributed 20 percent of 2020 production and 15 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

in 2020 the company drilled 36 gross development and 25 gross exploration wells in egypt a key component of the company’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3d seismic surveys that enable apache’s technical teams to consistently highgrade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the cretaceous jurassic and deeper paleozoic formations the company has completed seismic surveys covering over 3 million acres to date and continues to build and enhance its drilling inventory in egypt supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations on both new and existing acreage 

for 2021 the company plans to continue running a five rig drilling program for the year with a goal of stabilizing production and ultimately return egypt to growth both of which would require additional rigs apache is positioned to quickly flex spending in egypt as conditions warrant and will continue to monitor oil prices and cash flow for the appropriate time to pursue increased activity 

north sea apache has interests in approximately 516000 gross acres in the uk north sea these assets contributed 14 percent of apache’s 2020 production and approximately 13 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

apache entered the north sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the forties field forties since acquiring forties apache has actively invested in the assets and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of 4d seismic building upon its success in forties in 2011 apache acquired mobil north sea limited providing the company with additional exploration and development opportunities in the north sea across numerous fields including operated interests in the beryl ness nevis nevis south skene and buckland fields and a nonoperated interest in the maclure field apache also has a nonoperated interest in the nelson field acquired in 2011 the beryl field which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential provides for significant exploration opportunity the north sea assets plays a strategic role in apache’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with highimpact exploration potential near existing infrastructure 

during 2020 apache averaged two rigs in the north sea and drilled 6 gross development and two gross exploration wells 

the company’s storr exploration discovery came online in the fourth quarter of 2019 and its second well at garten came online in the first quarter of 2020 the first well at the company’s storr development is a highrate gas condensate well that is tied back to existing infrastructure at the beryl alpha platform the garten 2 well encountered approximately 1200 feet of net pay and apache holds a 100 percent working interest in the garten complex both of these exploration discoveries coming online coupled with the modest drilling activity level for the year increased the company’s production in the north sea compared to 2019 

in 2021 the expected capital program for the north sea remains relatively unchanged to the prior year with one floating rig and one platform crew 

international marketing apache’s natural gas production in egypt is sold to egpc primarily under an industrypricing formula a sliding scale based on dated brent crude oil with a minimum of 150 per mmbtu and a maximum of 265 per mmbtu plus an upward adjustment for liquids content crude oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to egpc when called upon to supply domestic demand oil production sold to third parties is sold and exported from one of two terminals on the northern coast of egypt oil production sold to egpc is sold at prices related to the export market  

apache’s north sea crude oil production is sold under term entitlement volume contracts and spot variable volume contracts with a marketbased index price plus a differential to capture the higher market value under each type of arrangement natural gas from the beryl field is processed through the scottish area gas evacuation sage gas plant operated by ancala midstream acquisitions limited natural gas is sold to a third party at the st fergus entry point of the national grid on a national balancing point index price basis the condensate mix from the sage plant is processed further downstream the split streams of propane butane and condensate are sold separately on a monthly entitlement basis at the braefoot bay terminal using index pricing less transportation 

other exploration 

new ventures apache’s international new ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the company’s traditional core areas and targeting higherrisk higherreward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins 

in december 2019 apache entered into a joint venture agreement with total sa to explore and develop block 58 offshore suriname the company holds a 50 percent working interest in block 58 which comprises approximately 14 million gross acres in water depths ranging from less than 100 meters to more than 2100 meters starting in late 2019 and throughout 2020 apache drilled the first three wells in the block the maka central1 sapakara west1 and kwaskwasi1 all of which successfully tested for the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper cretaceousaged campanian and santonian intervals encountering both oil and gas condensate 

in january 2021 apache and total sa announced the fourth consecutive discovery in block 58 at keskesi east1 which confirmed oil in the eastern portion of the block the keskesi east1 well is continuing to drill to deeper targets in accordance with the joint venture agreement apache transferred operatorship of block 58 to total sa on january 1 2021 apache will continue to operate the keskesi exploration well until completion of drilling operations 

drilling statistics 

worldwide in 2020 apache drilled or participated in drilling 132 gross wells with 119 wells 90 percent completed as producers historically apache’s drilling activities in the us have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration as a general matter the company’s operations outside of the us focus on a mix of exploration and development wells in addition to wells completed at yearend a number of wells had not yet reached completion 80 gross 631 net in the us 24 gross 235 net in egypt 1 gross 1 net in the north sea and 1 gross 05 net in suriname 

the following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years 



productive oil and gas wells 

the number of productive oil and gas wells operated and nonoperated in which the company had an interest as of december 31 2020 is set forth below 



gross natural gas and crude oil wells include 558 wells with multiple completions 

production pricing and lease operating cost data 

the following table describes for each of the last three fiscal years oil ngl and gas production volumes average lease operating costs per boe including transportation costs but excluding severance and other taxes and average sales prices for each of the countries where the company has operations 



1 includes production volumes attributable to a onethird noncontrolling interest in egypt 

2 sales volumes from the north sea for 2020  2019 and 2018 were 227 mmboe 218 mmboe and 203 mmboe respectively sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the beryl field 

gross and net undeveloped and developed acreage 

the following table summarizes the company’s gross and net acreage position as of december 31 2020 



as of december 31 2020 approximately 46 percent of us net undeveloped acreage was held by production 

as of december 31 2020 apache held 15 million net undeveloped acres that are scheduled to expire by yearend 2021 if production is not established or the company takes no action to extend the terms the company also held 533000 and 408000 net undeveloped acres set to expire by yearend 2022 and 2023 respectively the company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the company and third parties including governments 

exploration concessions in the company’s egypt asset comprise a significant portion of its expiring net undeveloped acreage with approximately 13 million 74000 and 343000 net undeveloped acres set to expire during 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively no oil and gas reserves were recorded on this undeveloped acreage set to expire the company will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist 

additionally the company has exploration interests in suriname consisting of 390000 net undeveloped acres in block 53 set to expire in 2022 contingent on planned drilling activity the company has acquired 3d seismic surveys over all acreages no oil and gas reserves have been recorded on this undeveloped acreage 

estimated proved reserves and future net cash flows 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas crude oil condensate and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods the company reports all estimated proved reserves held under productionsharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method which excludes the host country’s share of reserves 

estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed the costs of the operation reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been fieldtested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation in estimating its proved reserves apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy with similar properties apache will at times utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models petrophysical techniques and proprietary 3d seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the company’s reserve estimates 

proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period 

the following table shows proved oil ngl and gas reserves as of december 31 2020 based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2020 held flat for the life of the production except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms the total column of this table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl this ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products 



1 includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of 55 mmboe and 4 mmboe respectively attributable to a onethird noncontrolling interest in egypt 

as of december 31 2020 apache had total estimated proved reserves of 434 mmbbls of crude oil 169 mmbbls of ngls and 16 tcf of natural gas combined these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of 874 million barrels of oil or 52 tcf of natural gas of which oil represents 50 percent as of december 31 2020 the company’s proved developed reserves totaled 798 mmboe and estimated pud reserves totaled 76 mmboe or approximately 9 percent of worldwide total proved reserves apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing the company does not have any fields that contain 15 percent or more of its total proved reserves for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

during 2020 the company added 78 mmboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity partially offset by combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 45 mmboe engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 27 mmboe and downward revisions related to changes in product prices and interest accounted for 70 mmboe and 2 mmboe respectively the company also sold 10 mmboe of proved reserves associated with us divestitures primarily related to eastern shelf and magnet witherspickett ridge 

the company’s estimates of proved reserves proved developed reserves and pud reserves as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in note 18—supplemental oil and gas disclosures unaudited in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum end of period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months held flat for the life of the production except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements 

proved undeveloped reserves 

the company’s total estimated pud reserves of 76 mmboe as of december 31 2020 decreased by 42 mmboe from 118 mmboe of pud reserves reported at the end of 2019 during the year apache converted 35 mmboe of pud reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity in the us apache converted 25 mmboe with the remaining 10 mmboe in apache’s international areas apache did not sell any pud reserves in the us and did not acquire any pud reserves during the year apache added 43 mmboe of new pud reserves through extensions and discoveries apache did not recognize an upward engineering revision in proved undeveloped reserves during the year downward revisions included 1 mmboe associated with engineering and interest revisions 43 mmboe associated with revised development plans and 6 mmboe associated with product prices 

during the year a total of approximately 339 million was spent on projects associated with proved undeveloped reserves a portion of apache’s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will convert undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in future years during 2020 apache spent approximately 251 million on pud reserve development activity in the us and 88 million in the international areas as of december 31 2020 apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure 

preparation of oil and gas reserve information 

apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which by their very nature are subject to revision these estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward as warranted 

apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups these engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production costs net revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves all relevant data is compiled in a computer database application to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to apache’s board of directors in summary form on a quarterly basis annually each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating asset engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses netback prices production trends and development timing are reasonable 

apache’s executive vice president of development is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the company’s internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a thirdparty engineering firm he has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in petroleum engineering and over 30 years of experience in the energy industry and energy sector of the banking industry the executive vice president of development reports directly to the company’s chief executive officer 

the estimate of reserves disclosed in this annual report on form 10k is prepared by the company’s internal staff and the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates the company engages ryder scott company lp petroleum consultants ryder scott to conduct a reserves audit which includes a review of our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves the company selects the properties for review by ryder scott based primarily on relative reserve value the company also considers other factors such as geographic location new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume during 2020 the properties selected for each country ranged from 84 to 86 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent these properties also accounted for 84 percent of the value of apache’s international proved reserves and 94 percent of the value of apache’s new wells drilled worldwide in addition all fields containing five percent or more of the company’s total proved reserves volume were included in ryder scott’s review the review covered 81 percent of total proved reserves on a boe basis 

ryder scott’s review for the years 2020 2019 and 2018 covered 85 87 and 86 percent respectively of the value and 81 85 and 83 percent respectively of the volume of the company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves ryder scott’s 2020 review covered 80 82 and 83 percent of the estimated proved reserve volume in the us egypt and uk respectively 

ryder scott’s review of 2019 covered 85 percent of us 86 percent of egypt and 80 percent of the uk’s total proved reserves 

ryder scott’s review of 2018 covered 82 percent of us 85 percent of egypt and 81 percent of the uk’s total proved reserves 

the company has filed ryder scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

according to ryder scott’s opinion based on their review including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by apache the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current sec regulations and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by apache are in aggregate reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the society of petroleum engineers auditing standards 

altus midstream 

in november 2018 apache completed a transaction with altus midstream company and its then whollyowned subsidiary altus midstream lp collectively altus to create a pureplay permian basin midstream ccorporation anchored by gathering processing and transmission assets at alpine high pursuant to the agreement apache contributed certain alpine high midstream assets and options the pipeline options to acquire equity interests in five separate thirdparty pipeline projects the equity method interest pipelines to altus midstream lp andor its subsidiaries in exchange for the assets apache received economic voting and noneconomic voting shares in altus midstream company and limited partner interests in altus midstream lp representing an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in the combined entities 

apache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of altus in its consolidated financial statements with a corresponding noncontrolling interest reflected separately 

gathering processing and transmission assets 

altus owns develops and operates gas gathering processing and transmission assets in the permian basin of west texas altus generates revenue by providing feebased natural gas gathering compression processing and transmission services for apache’s production from its alpine high resource play as of december 31 2020 altus’ assets included approximately 182 miles of inservice natural gas gathering pipelines approximately 46 miles of residuegas pipelines with four market connections and approximately 38 miles of ngl pipelines three cryogenic processing trains each with nameplate capacity of 200 mmcfd were placed into service during 2019 other assets include an ngl truck loading terminal with six lease automatic custody transfer units and eight ngl bullet tanks with 90000 gallon capacity per tank altus’ existing gathering processing and transmission infrastructure is expected to provide capacity levels capable of fulfilling its midstream contracts to service apache’s production from alpine high and thirdparty customers as market activity in the area continues to develop

major customers 

the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties a significant portion of which are concentrated in energyrelated industries the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review including the use of master netting agreements where appropriate during 2020 sales to egpc and vitol accounted for approximately 17 percent and 14 percent respectively of the company’s worldwide crude oil natural gas and ngls production revenues during 2019 sales to bp and sinopec and their respective affiliates each accounted for approximately 10 percent and 11 percent respectively of the company’s worldwide crude oil natural gas and ngls production revenues during 2018 sales to bp sinopec and egpc and their respective affiliates each accounted for approximately 17 percent 15 percent and 10 percent respectively of the company’s worldwide crude oil natural gas and ngls production revenues 

management does not believe that the loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 

human capital management 

as a company apache believes its people are its greatest asset exploring what’s possible at apache is the union of curiosity intellect and hard work built on mutual respect honesty integrity and a keen sense of responsibility for the company’s team community and the environment with respect to its employees the company is focused on health and safety diversity and inclusion and total rewards so that joining the apache family is a positive experience for all 

in 2020 a major redesign of apache’s organizational structure and operations and the global covid19 pandemic had significant impacts on the company’s human capital management in connection with the organizational and operational redesign and changes in the economic environment in which apache operates the company offered voluntary retirement packages made reductionsinforce and began limiting hiring to critical business roles in response to the global covid19 pandemic apache implemented significant operating environment changes that the company determined were in the best interest of its employees and complied with government regulations these changes include having the vast majority of apache’s employees working from home while implementing additional safety protocols and procedures for essential employees continuing critical onsite work 

oversight and management 

apache’s board of directors has three standing committees each devoted to a separate aspect of risk oversight the corporate governance and nominating cgn committee the audit committee the management development and compensation mdc committee andor the full board of directors receive regular reports on certain human capital matters including the company’s diversity and inclusion programs and initiatives 

• the mdc committee oversees apaches compensation programs leadership development and succession planning strategies and seeks continuous improvement in the diversity and inclusion practices used in developing and deploying these processes 

• the audit committee oversees the integrity of the companys financial statements and monitors human capital management risk against compliance with legal and regulatory requirements 

• the cgn committee oversees the nomination of candidates for election to the board of directors the annual board of directors evaluation process corporate governance and environmental social and governance esg issues as well as the company’s annual sustainability report 

reports and recommendations made to the board of directors and its committees are part of the framework that ensures the company’s daily actions and decisions are guided by its core values including upholding the health and safety of apache’s team stakeholders and communities investing in its workforce ensuring environmental responsibility and acting ethically and with integrity 

covid19 response 

during the early stages of the pandemic apache called upon its crisis management team to lead and coordinate the companys overall covid19 pandemic response this team led efforts to develop and monitor mitigation and business continuity plans track all relevant country state and local government guidelines directives and regulations develop and adopt workfromhome plans implement safe working protocols for production teams assess and implement appropriate returntooffice protocols and provide timely and transparent communications to global employees and key stakeholders 

in response to the covid19 pandemic apache began providing the following benefits to its employees 

• covering the cost of covid19 testing at the company’s onsite testing events and through expanded insurance coverage 

• expanding telehealth benefits 

• promoting mental health and wellbeing plans 

• implementing enhanced hardship distributions and loan eligibility and repayment terms in the apache 401k savings plan and 

• providing additional paid sick leave for quarantined employees 

employee profile 

as of december 31 2020 apache had approximately 2272 fulltime equivalent employees in locations across the organization as follows 



the employment of approximately 637 employees globally were impacted by involuntary reductionsinforce in 2020 the impacted employees were provided severance packages that included companypaid benefits and outplacement services the voluntary workforce turnover for 2020 was 96 percent 

as of yearend 2020 apache’s global workforce was 221 percent female and 779 percent male and women represented 176 percent of leadership defined as supervisor level and above or equivalent in the us apache’s workforce selfidentified as 669 percent white 6 percent black 68 percent asian 186 percent hispanic and 17 percent other for the company’s us leadership the breakdown was 78 percent white 3 percent black 63 percent asian 113 percent hispanic and 14 percent other 

health and safety 

safety underpins the company’s core values and is at the forefront of decisionmaking at every level of the apache organization apache is committed to driving a safety culture that empowers its team to act as needed to work safely and to stop the job if conditions are deemed unsafe apache’s goal is to demonstrate a continual reduction in occupational safety and health administration osha recordable incidents year over year to this end the company’s annual osha recordable incident rate targets are set at a 10 percent reduction compared to the preceding 3year average during the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 the recordable incident count for the company declined by 21 percent compared to the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 

apache offers a wide range of training programs for employees and contractors to promote their full understanding of and compliance with the company’s health and safety policies and programs and to help build the skills needed to work safely in addition to providing specific skills these training programs encourage personal responsibility for safe operating conditions and help build a culture of individual accountability for conducting job tasks in a safe and responsible manner 

a few key highlights from 2020 

• egypt from drilling to driving safework behavior improved dramatically the jointventure drilling team had 55 percent fewer injuries in the second half of 2020 as compared to the first half of 2020 

• suriname with the complexities of working during the pandemic stringent health and safety protocols have kept personnel safe as they rotate offshore rewarding excellence the drilling team and noble sam croft drillship achieved one year without any recordable incidents 

• uk in an effort to connect teams with management apache’s elected safety representatives have increased workforce engagement around offshore operations and safety new platform meetings put safety at the forefront of conversations about performance accidents and hazards industry updates and valuable topics such as mental health 

• us despite economic pressures and pandemic challenges us onshore operations and asset teams performed exceptionally the southern midland basin legacy and delaware basin collectively achieved over 800 days without injuries 

diversity and inclusion 

diversity and inclusion di are vital to apache’s longterm sustainability the company is committed to being a workplace where all employees are valued and can thrive with a sense of belonging not just as an employee but as a person this benefits the individual apache and the company’s stakeholders apache is better as an organization when various ideas and perspectives are brought to the table as a part of the company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion in august 2020 apache hired a di lead and partnered with a prominent di consultant to better understand where the organization stands in its di efforts and to build a di strategy that directly supports the company’s diversity and inclusion goals to further the company’s strategy apache conducted focus group sessions to gain insight into its employees’ experiences and to better understand its di strengths and opportunities with this feedback in mind apache evaluated its recruiting talent management and learning efforts to identify and implement changes that would allow for increased employee opportunities belonging and workplace diversity 

to showcase a visible commitment apache launched a diversity  inclusion employee site that provides di and allyship trainings and information on how to join and initiate employee resource groups erg apache currently has four ergs the apache women’s network awn apache young professionals’ network aypn apache di council and the newly formed apache black professionals network abpn these groups encourage cultural awareness professional development community outreach and networking the company looks forward to expanding its ergs to help build employee connections and belonging support apache’s community outreach programs and foster career development over the years to come apache will continue to actively support employees in forming additional demographicbased groups eg ethnicity nationality age sexual orientation etc as well as interestbased groups eg support sports hobbies etc 

apache embraces the idea of continuous improvement in all that it does and its di journey is no different the company is committed to continually improving and making changes throughout the organization to foster a more inclusive and diverse workforce

additional information about apache 

response plans and available resources 

apache and its wholly owned subsidiary apache deepwater llc adw developed oil spill response plans the plans for their respective gulf of mexico operations and offshore operations in the north sea and suriname which ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties annually drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the plans 

apache is a member of oil spill response limited osrl a large international oil spill response cooperative which entitles any apache entity worldwide to access osrl’s services apache also has a contract for response resources and services with national response corporation nrc nrc is the world’s largest commercial oil spill response organization and is the global leader in providing endtoend environmental industrial and emergency response solutions with operating bases in 13 countries 

in the event of a spill in the gulf of mexico clean gulf associates cga is the primary oil spill response association available to apache and adw both apache and adw are members of cga a notforprofit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the gulf of mexico cga was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the gulf of mexico 

additionally apache is an active member of wild well control’s wellcontained subsea containment system for suriname operations this membership includes contingency planning and response to an uncontrolled subsea well event apache utilizes a detailed source control emergency response plan scerp for offshore suriname planning the scerp has been designed to ensure that the goals of apache’s source control emergency preparedness efforts will be met in the unlikely event of an actual response to an uncontrolled well event this includes the use of subsea dispersant systems and field deployment of one of wild well control’s containment system capping stacks 

competitive conditions 

the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves the acquisition of oil and gas leases equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves and the gathering and marketing of oil gas and natural gas liquids our competitors include national oil companies major integrated oil and gas companies other independent oil and gas companies and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial commercial and individual consumers 

certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights 

however we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets which comprises large acreage positions and wellestablished production bases across three geographic areas our balanced production mix between oil and gas our management and incentive systems and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices local business environments and markets it also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country 

environmental compliance 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently to any material degree than other companies in our industry 

we have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry we have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business we have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations the costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters however we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

tableend

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks including those described below if any of such events should occur our business financial condition liquidity andor results of operations could be materially harmed and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectus supplements related to offerings of our securities from time to time in the future 

risks related to pricing demand and production for crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls 

the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact the company’s business financial condition and results of operations the global economy and the demand for and prices of oil natural gas and ngls the unprecedented nature of the current situation makes it impossible for the company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business 

the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic have adversely impacted the global economy and created significant volatility in the global financial markets business closures restrictions on travel “stayathome” or “shelterinplace” orders and other restrictions on movement within and among communities have significantly reduced demand for and the prices of oil natural gas and ngls as of the date of this report efforts to contain covid19 have not been successful in many regions vaccination programs have encountered delays and the global pandemic remains ongoing a continued prolonged period of such reduced demand the failure to timely distribute or the ineffectiveness of any vaccines the failure to develop adequate treatments and other adverse impacts from the pandemic may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

the company’s operations rely on its workforce being able to access its wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with its oil and gas leases additionally because the company has implemented remote working procedures for a significant portion of its workforce for health and safety reasons andor to comply with applicable national state andor local government requirements the company relies on such persons having sufficient access to its information technology systems including through telecommunication hardware software and networks if a significant portion of the company’s workforce cannot effectively perform their responsibilities whether resulting from a lack of physical or virtual access quarantines illnesses governmental actions or restrictions information technology or telecommunication failures or other restrictions or adverse impacts resulting from the pandemic the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the unprecedented nature of the current situation resulting from the covid19 pandemic makes it impossible for the company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business financial condition cash flows or results of operations such results will depend on future events which the company cannot predict including the scope duration and potential reoccurrence of the covid19 pandemic or any other localized epidemic or global pandemic the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments the demand for and the prices of oil natural gas and ngls and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities customers contractors and suppliers in response to the covid19 pandemic or any other epidemics or pandemics the covid19 pandemic and its unprecedented consequences have amplified and may continue to amplify the other risks identified in this report 

crude oil natural gas and ngl price volatility could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock 

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil natural gas and ngl production historically the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future for example the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2020 ranged from a high of 6327 per barrel to a low of 3698 per barrel the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2020 ranged from a high of 314 per mmbtu to a low of 133 per mmbtu the market prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls depend on factors beyond our control these factors include demand which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors including 

• worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil natural gas and ngls 

• actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations including the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec 

• political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions 

• the occurrence of global events such as epidemics or pandemics including specifically the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities customers contractors and suppliers in response to such epidemics or pandemics 

• the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories 

• the price and level of imported foreign crude oil natural gas and ngls 

• the price and availability of alternative fuels including coal and biofuels 

• the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure 

• the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity 

• weather conditions 

• domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes and 

• the overall economic environment 

our results of operations as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil natural gas and ngls despite slight increases in oil and natural gas prices in 2020 prices have remained significantly lower than levels seen in recent years which has adversely affected our revenues operating income cash flow and proved reserves continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures without the ability to fund capital expenditures we would be unable to replace reserves and production sustained low prices of crude oil natural gas and ngls may further adversely impact our business as follows 

• weakening our financial condition and reducing our liquidity 

• limiting our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations 

• reducing the amount of crude oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically 

• causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects 

• reducing our revenues operating income and cash flows 

• limiting our access to sources of capital such as equity and longterm debt 

• reducing the carrying value of our oil and gas properties resulting in additional noncash impairments or 

• reducing the carrying value of our gathering processing and transmission facilities resulting in additional impairments 

our ability to sell crude oil natural gas or ngls andor receive market prices for these commodities andor meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints the inability to procure and resell volumes economically and various transportation interruptions 

a portion of our crude oil natural gas and ngl production in any region may be interrupted limited or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons including as a result of weather conditions accidents loss of pipeline or gathering system access field labor issues or strikes or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems processing facilities or interstate pipelines to transport our production or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows additionally if we are unable to procure and resell thirdparty volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill 

drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically the costs of drilling completing and operating wells are often uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

• unexpected drilling conditions 

• pressure or irregularities in formations 

• equipment failures or accidents 

• fires explosions blowouts and surface cratering 

• marine risks such as capsizing collisions and hurricanes 

• other adverse weather conditions and 

• increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment 

future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while all drilling whether developmental or exploratory involves these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks 

to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which 

• our production falls short of the hedged volumes 

• there is a widening of pricebasis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement 

• the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements or 

• an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices 

risks related to operations and development projects 

our operations involve a high degree of operational risk particularly risk of personal injury damage to or loss of equipment and environmental accidents 

our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling production and transportation of crude oil natural gas and ngls including 

• well blowouts explosions and cratering 

• pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills 

• fires 

• formations with abnormal pressures 

• equipment malfunctions 

• hurricanes storms andor cyclones which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the gulf coast north sea and suriname and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions and 

• surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents saltwater or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives 

failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions cyberattacks or natural disasters such as hurricanes could result in property damages personal injury environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence such as a well blowout explosion fire at a location where our equipment and services are used or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses if a significant amount of our production is interrupted our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence our cash flows and in turn our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and production 

demand for oil and gas are to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce in addition our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather such as freezing temperatures hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or storms in the north sea which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment our planning for normal climatic variation insurance programs and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions and not all such effects can be predicted eliminated or insured against 

our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face which could result in significant financial exposure 

exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and ngls can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts cratering fires explosions and loss of well control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment our international operations are also subject to political risk the insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability moreover insurance is not available to us against all operational risks 

a terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by us or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations 

our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development and production activities we depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves process and record financial and operating data analyze seismic and drilling information communicate with our employees and thirdparty partners and conduct many of our activities unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption data corruption communication interruption loss of intellectual property loss of confidential and fiduciary data and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information also external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the united states and abroad which are necessary to transport and market our production a cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions any such terrorist attack environmental activist group activity or cyberattack that affects the company or our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business cause us to incur a material financial loss subject us to possible legal claims and liability andor damage our reputation 

while certain of our insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur 

while we have experienced cyberattacks in the past we have not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks however there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future further as cyberattacks continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in addition cyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures the company cannot predict the potential impact that such additional regulations could have on our business and operations or the energy industry at large 

material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects 

we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies weather conditions manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment and other unforeseen events delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in largescale development projects in the future in addition our estimates of future development costs are based on our current expectations of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate if costs become too high our development projects may become uneconomic to us and we may be forced to abandon such development projects 

risks related to reserves and leasehold acreage 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted while related perunit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities identify additional behindpipe zones secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced future oil and gas production is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis furthermore if oil or gas prices increase our cost for additional reserves could also increase 

we may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves 

although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices such reviews are inherently incomplete it generally is not feasible to review indepth every individual property involved in each acquisition ordinarily we will focus our review efforts on the highervalue properties and will sample the remainder however even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates in addition there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations 

crude oil natural gas and ngl reserves are estimates and actual recoveries may vary significantly 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil natural gas and ngl reserves and their value reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil natural gas and ngls that cannot be measured in an exact manner because of the high degree of judgment involved the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation our reserves estimates are based on 12month average prices except where contractual arrangements exist therefore reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease in addition results of drilling testing and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time the estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results including 

• historical production from the area compared with production from other areas 

• the effects of regulations by governmental agencies including changes to severance and excise taxes 

• future operating costs and capital expenditures and 

• workover and remediation costs 

for these reasons estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls attributable to any particular group of properties classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially accordingly reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment and actual production revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary possibly materially from estimates 

additionally because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure in addition realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 

certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage 

a sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms the leases will expire if our leases expire we will lose our right to develop the related properties our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors including drilling results commodity prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs availability of drilling services and equipment gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 

risks related to counterparties 

the credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us 

we are party to numerous transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including commercial banks investment banks insurance companies other investment funds and other institutions these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us we may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges we also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies in addition if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under our credit facilities 

we are exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract this risk of counterparty nonperformance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in commodity prices which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract we are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform even if we do accurately predict sudden changes our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities during periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase which increases our exposure if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance we could incur a significant loss 

the distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs 

concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil natural gas and ngl prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry we are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade joint venture joint interest billing and other receivables we sell our crude oil natural gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers as operator we pay expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of costs as a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in commodity prices some of our customers and nonoperating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or nonoperating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or nonoperating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by 

the distressed entity or entities nonperformance by a trade creditor or nonoperating partner could result in significant financial losses 

our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case 

from time to time we have divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets the agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions indemnities escrows trusts and similar arrangements one of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by us one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress in the event that any such counterparty were to become the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11 of the united states code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law which we collectively refer to as insolvency laws the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions in that case our remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations resolution of our claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise pending final resolution of the proceeding 

despite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations we would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require us to perform and hold us responsible for such liabilities and obligations in such event we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise 

if a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions or any similar determination or action it could adversely impact our cash flows operations or financial condition 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations 

we conduct many of our exploration and production ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not an operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made that we do not believe are in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected 

we own an approximate 79 percent interest in altus which holds substantially all of our former gathering processing and transmission assets in alpine high altus may be subject to different risks than those described in this form 10k 

we own an approximate 79 percent interest in altus which holds substantially all of our former gathering processing and transmission assets in alpine high altus owns develops and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas anchored by midstream service contracts to service our production from our alpine high resource play altus generates revenue by providing feebased natural gas gathering compression processing and transmission services and through its equity method interest pipelines given the nature of its business altus may be subject to different and additional risks than those described in this annual report on form 10k for a description of these risks refer to altus’ most recently filed annual report on form 10k and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on form 10q 

risks related to capital markets 

a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital 

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix commodity pricing levels and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt during 2020 our credit rating was downgraded by moody’s to ba1negative and by standard and poor’s to bbnegative these and other past ratings downgrades have required and any future downgrades may require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations 

market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs which may limit our financial flexibility 

the financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks we have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio which will require substantial future investment we andor our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities our future access to capital as well as that of our partners and contractors could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained this could significantly delay development of our property interests 

our syndicated credit facility currently matures in march 2024 there is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future agreements will make loans or other extensions of credit available to apache or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders 

the discontinuation and uncertain cessation date of libor and the adoption of an alternative reference rate may have a material adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs 

pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility 1 we may elect to use london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings and 2 the commission payable to the lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit uses libor as a benchmark on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration iba announced that it intends to continue publishing libor until the end of june 2023 beyond the previously announced 2021 cessation date the iba announcement was supported by announcements from the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor and the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal deposit insurance corporation and office of the comptroller of the currency us regulators however both the fca and us regulators in their announcements also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing libor after december 2021 these announcements indicate that the continuation of libor on the current basis may not be assured after 2021 and will not be assured beyond 2023 in light of these recent announcements the future of libor at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or regulatory activity related to libor’s phaseout could cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist 

in the united states the alternative reference rates committee the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to libor has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative rate for libor there can be no guarantee that sofr will become a widelyaccepted benchmark in place of libor although the full impact of the transition away from libor including the discontinuance of libor publication and the adoption of sofr as the replacement rate for libor remains unclear these changes may have an adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs under our revolving credit facility 

our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations 

the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors which considers among other factors our operating results overall financial condition creditrisk considerations and capital requirements as well as general business and market conditions our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends 

any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock including our common stock in addition under delaware law dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus” which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities including contingent liabilities and the amount of our capital if there is no surplus cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid 

from our net profits for the thencurrent andor the preceding fiscal year further even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock 

risks related to financial results 

future economic conditions in the us and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results 

current global market conditions and uncertainty including the economic instability in europe and certain emerging markets are likely to have significant longterm effects on our operating results global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources including fossil fuels a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our oil and gas production as well as lower commodity prices which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability 

we face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas ep industry we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases properties and reserves equipment and labor required to explore develop and operate those properties and marketing of crude oil natural gas and ngl production crude oil natural gas and ngl prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

the company’s ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income may be limited if the company experiences an ownership change 

as described in note 10—income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards nols and other tax attributes available to potentially offset future taxable income if the company were to experience an “ownership change” under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change by value in the company’s equity ownership by fivepercent shareholders over a threeyear period the company’s ability to utilize its prechange nols and other prechange tax attributes to potentially offset its postchange income or taxes may be limited such a limitation could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results or cash flows by effectively increasing its future tax obligations 

risks related to governmental regulation and political risks 

we may incur significant costs related to environmental matters 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages limit or constrain operations in affected areas and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations in addition it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition 

our united states operations are subject to governmental risks 

our united states operations have been and at times in the future may be affected by political developments and by federal state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production changes in taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection laws and regulations 

in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the us gulf of mexico in april 2010 and as directed by the secretary of the us department of the interior the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety environmental matters drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the gulf of mexico these regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the gulf of mexico 

with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico the boem issued a notice to lessees ntl no 2016n01 significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases while the ntl was paused in mid2017 and is currently listed on boem’s website as “rescinded” if reinstated the ntl will likely require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations relating to apache’s current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases we are working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security if such security becomes necessary under the ntl additionally we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern 

new political developments the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting our united states operations and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations 

changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business 

certain countries where we operate including the united kingdom either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas ghg related fees on our operations exposure has not been material to date although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations additionally there has been discussion in other countries where we operate including the united states regarding legislation or regulation of ghg any such legislation or regulation if enacted could either tax or assess some form of ghgrelated fees on our operations and could lead to increased operating expenses or cause us to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications 

in the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change do transpire we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations however any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing waste disposal oil spills and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja was signed into law in addition to reducing the us corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 certain provisions in the tcja move the us away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income the new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime the tcja also includes provisions which could impact or limit the company’s ability to deduct interest expense or utilize net operating losses 

the us federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration development and extraction may be further modified by administrative legislative or judicial interpretation at any time previous legislative proposals if enacted into law could make significant changes to such laws including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies these changes include but are not limited to i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and iii an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures the passage or adoption of these changes or similar changes could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted any such changes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

proposed federal state or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs 

several proposals are before the us congress that if implemented would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation ballot initiatives executive orders or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting transparency and well construction requirements on hydraulicfracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity in addition some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities andor hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so we routinely use fracturing techniques in the us and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore it is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability 

although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the us 

risks related to international operations 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

our operations outside the united states are based primarily in egypt and the united kingdom on a barrel equivalent basis approximately 42 percent of our 2020 production was outside the united states and approximately 33 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of december 31 2020 were located outside the united states as a result a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including but not limited to 

• general strikes and civil unrest 

• the risk of war acts of terrorism expropriation and resource nationalization and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts 

• import and export regulations 

• taxation policies including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims and investment restrictions 

• price control 

• transportation regulations and tariffs 

• constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area 

• exchange controls currency fluctuations devaluations or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds 

• laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade including trade sanctions 

• the effects of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the british pound 

• the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate 

• the possible inability to subject foreign persons especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states and 

• difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations 

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country our interests could decrease in value or be lost even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability 

the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities as have occurred in countries and regions in which we operate may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities 

a deterioration of conditions in egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in egypt could have an adverse impact on our business 

deterioration in the political economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the egyptian government such as changes in laws or regulations export restrictions expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization andor forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with egpc or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our operations in egypt excluding the impacts of a onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 20 percent of our 2020 production and accounted for 15 percent of our yearend estimated proved reserves and 24 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows 

our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations 

our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the british pound our financial statements presented in us dollars may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations particularly through the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies 

risks related to the planned holding company reorganization 

if the holding company reorganization is implemented apa corporation as the parent holding company of apache will be dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries including apache 

if the holding company reorganization is implemented apa corporation will become the successor issuer to and parent holding company of apache apa corporation will have no business operations of its own apa corporation’s only significant assets will be the outstanding equity interests of its subsidiaries including apache as a result apa corporation will rely on cash flows from apache to pay dividends with respect to its common stock and to meet its financial obligations including to service any debt obligations that apa corporation may incur from time to time legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing future indebtedness of apache as well as apache’s financial condition and future operating 

requirements may limit apache’s ability to distribute cash to apa corporation if apache is limited in its ability to distribute cash to apa corporation or if apache’s earnings or other available assets of are not sufficient to pay distributions or make loans to apa corporation in the amounts or at the times necessary for apa corporation to pay dividends with respect to its common stock andor to meet its financial obligations then apa corporation’s business financial condition cash flows results of operations and reputation may be materially adversely affected 

if the holding company reorganization is implemented apa corporation may not obtain the anticipated benefits of the reorganization into a holding company structure 

if the holding company reorganization is implemented we believe that our new operating structure will allow us to focus on running our diverse businesses independently with the goal of maximizing each of the business’ potential however the anticipated benefits of the planned holding company reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent us from taking advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that we expect it may afford us as a result we may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

management is dedicating significant effort to the new operating structure these efforts may divert management’s focus and resources from the company’s operations strategic initiatives or development opportunities which could adversely affect our prospects business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

general risk factors 

certain antitakeover provisions in our charter and delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights dividend rates liquidation preferences conversion rights redemption rights including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock in addition delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders

business strategy 

our vision is to be the premier exploration and production company contributing to global progress by helping meet the world’s energy needs 

our mission is to grow in an innovative safe environmentally responsible and profitable manner for the longterm benefit of our stakeholders 

our strategy is to take a differentiated approach to the exploration and production of costadvantaged hydrocarbons through innovation technology optimization continuous improvement and relentless focus on costs to deliver toptier longterm returns 

rigorous management of the company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long term over the past several years apache has entered into a series of transactions that have upgraded its portfolio of assets enhanced its capital allocation process to further optimize investment returns and increased focus on internally generated exploration with fullcycle returnsfocused growth these efforts included the monetization of certain nonstrategic assets including gasweighted properties in the midcontinentgulf coast region and selling other noncore leasehold positions the company made strategic decisions to allocate the proceeds of these divestitures to more impactful development opportunities across its portfolio and exploration efforts in suriname in addition in november 2018 the company completed a transaction with altus midstream company and its then whollyowned subsidiary altus midstream lp to create a publiclytraded midstream ccorporation 

apache’s us upstream oil and gas assets are complemented by its international assets in egypt and the north sea each of which adds to the company’s inventory of exploration and development opportunities apache’s diverse international portfolio and asset inventory includes at scale both conventional and unconventional resources covering crude oil rich natural gas with ngls and lean natural gas 

during 2020 the global economy and the energy industry were deeply impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related thirdparty actions uncertainty in the oil markets and the negative demand implications resulting from the covid19 pandemic continue to weigh on commodity prices as with previous changes in a volatile price environment apache has continued to respond quickly and decisively taking the following strategic actions 

• establishing and implementing a wide range of fitforpurpose protocols and procedures to ensure a safe and productive work environment across the company’s diversified global onshore and offshore operations 

• reducing upstream capital investments by over 50 percent from the comparative prioryear period including eliminating nearly all us drilling and completion activity by may 2020 and reducing planned activity in egypt and the north sea 

• decreasing the company’s dividend by 90 percent beginning in the first quarter of 2020 preserving approximately 340 million of cash flow on an annualized basis and strengthening liquidity

business overview 

the following business overview further describes the operations and activities for the company’s upstream exploration and production properties by geographic region and altus midstream 

upstream exploration and production 

operating areas 

apache has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas the us egypt and the north sea apache also has active exploration and planned appraisal operations ongoing in suriname as well as interests in other international locations that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities during 2020 as a result of the company’s organizational redesign apache shifted from a regionbased structure to a centralized structure focused on core asset groups and functions in each country 

the following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key 2020 data for each of apache’s operating areas additional data and discussion are provided in part ii item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k 



1 apache’s operations in egypt excluding the impacts of a onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 20 percent of 2020 production and accounted for 15 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

2 sales volumes from the north sea for 2020 were 227 mmboe sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the beryl field 

united states 

in 2020 apache’s us upstream oil and gas operations contributed approximately 58 percent of production and 67 percent of estimated yearend proved reserves apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 49 million gross acres 25 million net acres in the us 78 percent of which are undeveloped 

the company’s us assets are primarily located in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico including the permian subbasins midland basin central basin platformnorthwest shelf and delaware basin examples of shale plays being developed within these subbasins include the woodford barnett pennsylvanian cline wolfcamp bone spring and spraberry apache is one of the largest operators in the permian basin operating more than 7000 gross oil and gas wells across its acreage with additional interests in over 4000 nonoperated wells approximately six percent of the company’s net acreage position in the permian basin is on federal onshore lands apache also has operations located in and along the gulf of mexico in the areas onshore and offshore south texas and louisiana 

highlights of the company’s operations in the us include 

• southern midland basin apache holds approximately 360000 gross acres 256000 net acres in the southern midland basin the company began the year operating four rigs but suspended drilling and completion activity in may in response to collapsing commodity prices during 2020 the company averaged one rig targeting oil plays in the wolfcamp spraberry and lower cline formations drilling 33 gross development wells in this basin with a 100 percent success rate 

• delaware basin apache holds approximately 370000 gross acres 220000 net acres in the delaware basin including opportunities in the bone spring and other formations of eastern new mexico and bordering west texas and the alpine high play in the southern portion of the permian basin primarily in reeves county texas the company began the year operating three rigs but suspended drilling in may during 2020 the company averaged one rig drilling 19 gross development wells with a 95 percent success rate primarily targeting oil plays in the bone spring formation 

• legacy assets apache holds approximately 36 million gross acres 17 million net acres in legacy properties primarily in the central basin platform subbasin of the permian basin the eagle ford shale and austin chalk areas of southeast texas and in the offshore waters of the gulf of mexico and onshore louisiana the company participated in drilling eight gross nonoperated development wells in these areas during 2020 although operated drilling activity was minimal during 2020 the company continued to evaluate and highgrade inventory opportunities on its austin chalk acreage the company also monetized certain nonstrategic leasehold positions on its legacy acreage holdings during the year and is continuing to evaluate additional opportunities 

• new venture assets apache separately has undeveloped acreage positions across several states where it intends to pursue exploration interests and potential development opportunities over time 

with the improvement in oil prices the company is returning to a modest level of activity in the us for 2021 the company is currently running one drilling rig in the permian basin and plans to add a second rig in the middle of the year in addition the company recently added a rig in the austin chalk oil play to retain core acreage positions and perform targeted tests the company also resumed completions activity in the permian basin during the fourth quarter of 2020 and began completing previously drilled but uncompleted wells in response to significantly lower service costs as with prior periods the company will continue to monitor commodity prices and will adjust its capital budget accordingly to protect its cash flows 

us marketing in general most of the company’s us natural gas production is sold at either monthly or daily indexbased prices the tenor of the company’s sales contracts span from daily to multiyear transactions natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution utility and midstream companies as well as endusers marketers and integrated major oil companies apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk apache predominantly sells its natural gas production within the united states including to us lng export facilities although a portion is sold to markets in mexico 

apache primarily markets its us crude oil production to integrated major oil companies marketing and transportation companies and refiners based on west texas intermediate wti pricing indices eg wti houston west texas sour wts or wti midland and some predominately brent related international pricing indices adjusted for quality transportation and a marketreflective differential apache’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product sales contracts are generally 30day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party these contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices also from time to time the company will enter into physical term sales contracts these term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide an opportunity for higher than prevailing market prices 

apache’s us ngl production is sold under contracts with prices based on gulf coast supply and demand conditions less the costs for transportation and fractionation or on a weightedaverage sales price received by the purchaser 

us delivery commitments the company has longterm delivery commitments for natural gas and crude oil which require apache to deliver an average of 232 bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2021 through 2029 at variable marketbased pricing and deliver an average of 68 mmbbls of crude oil per year from 2020 through 2025 at variable marketbased pricing 

apache currently expects to fulfill its delivery commitments with production from its proved reserves production from continued development andor spot market purchases as necessary apache may also enter into contractual arrangements to reduce its delivery commitments the company has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its delivery commitments

international 

in 2020 international assets contributed 42 percent of apache’s production and 56 percent of oil and gas revenues approximately 33 percent of estimated proved reserves at yearend were located outside the us 

apache has two international locations with ongoing development and production operations 

• egypt which includes onshore conventional assets located in egypt’s western desert and 

• the north sea which includes offshore assets based in the united kingdom 

the company also has an active offshore exploration program and planned appraisal operations ongoing in suriname 

egypt apache has 25 years of exploration development and operations experience in egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in egypt’s western desert at yearend 2020 the company held 52 million gross acres in 24 separate concessions development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 1 to 20 years with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis approximately 68 percent of the company’s gross acreage in egypt is undeveloped providing apache with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future 

apache’s egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts pscs under the terms of the company’s pscs the contractor partner contractor bears the risk and cost of exploration development and production activities in return if exploration is successful the contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery additionally the contractor’s income taxes which remain the liability of the contractor under domestic law are paid by egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc on behalf of the contractor out of egpc’s production entitlement income taxes paid to the arab republic of egypt on behalf of the contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves because contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices in addition because the contractor income taxes are paid by egpc the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on apache’s egypt operations despite impacting apache’s production and reserves 

the company’s estimated proved reserves in egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves in addition sinopec international petroleum exploration and production corporation sinopec holds a onethird minority participation interest in apache’s oil and gas operations in egypt apache’s egypt assets including the onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 28 percent of 2020 production and 20 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves excluding the impacts of the noncontrolling interest egypt contributed 20 percent of 2020 production and 15 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

in 2020 the company drilled 36 gross development and 25 gross exploration wells in egypt a key component of the company’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3d seismic surveys that enable apache’s technical teams to consistently highgrade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the cretaceous jurassic and deeper paleozoic formations the company has completed seismic surveys covering over 3 million acres to date and continues to build and enhance its drilling inventory in egypt supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations on both new and existing acreage 

for 2021 the company plans to continue running a five rig drilling program for the year with a goal of stabilizing production and ultimately return egypt to growth both of which would require additional rigs apache is positioned to quickly flex spending in egypt as conditions warrant and will continue to monitor oil prices and cash flow for the appropriate time to pursue increased activity 

north sea apache has interests in approximately 516000 gross acres in the uk north sea these assets contributed 14 percent of apache’s 2020 production and approximately 13 percent of yearend estimated proved reserves 

apache entered the north sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the forties field forties since acquiring forties apache has actively invested in the assets and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of 4d seismic building upon its success in forties in 2011 apache acquired mobil north sea limited providing the company with additional exploration and development opportunities in the north sea across numerous fields including operated interests in the beryl ness nevis nevis south skene and buckland fields and a nonoperated interest in the maclure field apache also has a nonoperated interest in the nelson field acquired in 2011 the beryl field which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential provides for significant exploration opportunity the north sea assets plays a strategic role in apache’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with highimpact exploration potential near existing infrastructure 

during 2020 apache averaged two rigs in the north sea and drilled 6 gross development and two gross exploration wells 

the company’s storr exploration discovery came online in the fourth quarter of 2019 and its second well at garten came online in the first quarter of 2020 the first well at the company’s storr development is a highrate gas condensate well that is tied back to existing infrastructure at the beryl alpha platform the garten 2 well encountered approximately 1200 feet of net pay and apache holds a 100 percent working interest in the garten complex both of these exploration discoveries coming online coupled with the modest drilling activity level for the year increased the company’s production in the north sea compared to 2019 

in 2021 the expected capital program for the north sea remains relatively unchanged to the prior year with one floating rig and one platform crew 

international marketing apache’s natural gas production in egypt is sold to egpc primarily under an industrypricing formula a sliding scale based on dated brent crude oil with a minimum of 150 per mmbtu and a maximum of 265 per mmbtu plus an upward adjustment for liquids content crude oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to egpc when called upon to supply domestic demand oil production sold to third parties is sold and exported from one of two terminals on the northern coast of egypt oil production sold to egpc is sold at prices related to the export market  

apache’s north sea crude oil production is sold under term entitlement volume contracts and spot variable volume contracts with a marketbased index price plus a differential to capture the higher market value under each type of arrangement natural gas from the beryl field is processed through the scottish area gas evacuation sage gas plant operated by ancala midstream acquisitions limited natural gas is sold to a third party at the st fergus entry point of the national grid on a national balancing point index price basis the condensate mix from the sage plant is processed further downstream the split streams of propane butane and condensate are sold separately on a monthly entitlement basis at the braefoot bay terminal using index pricing less transportation 

other exploration 

new ventures apache’s international new ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the company’s traditional core areas and targeting higherrisk higherreward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins 

in december 2019 apache entered into a joint venture agreement with total sa to explore and develop block 58 offshore suriname the company holds a 50 percent working interest in block 58 which comprises approximately 14 million gross acres in water depths ranging from less than 100 meters to more than 2100 meters starting in late 2019 and throughout 2020 apache drilled the first three wells in the block the maka central1 sapakara west1 and kwaskwasi1 all of which successfully tested for the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper cretaceousaged campanian and santonian intervals encountering both oil and gas condensate 

in january 2021 apache and total sa announced the fourth consecutive discovery in block 58 at keskesi east1 which confirmed oil in the eastern portion of the block the keskesi east1 well is continuing to drill to deeper targets in accordance with the joint venture agreement apache transferred operatorship of block 58 to total sa on january 1 2021 apache will continue to operate the keskesi exploration well until completion of drilling operations 

drilling statistics 

worldwide in 2020 apache drilled or participated in drilling 132 gross wells with 119 wells 90 percent completed as producers historically apache’s drilling activities in the us have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration as a general matter the company’s operations outside of the us focus on a mix of exploration and development wells in addition to wells completed at yearend a number of wells had not yet reached completion 80 gross 631 net in the us 24 gross 235 net in egypt 1 gross 1 net in the north sea and 1 gross 05 net in suriname 

the following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years 



productive oil and gas wells 

the number of productive oil and gas wells operated and nonoperated in which the company had an interest as of december 31 2020 is set forth below 



gross natural gas and crude oil wells include 558 wells with multiple completions 

production pricing and lease operating cost data 

the following table describes for each of the last three fiscal years oil ngl and gas production volumes average lease operating costs per boe including transportation costs but excluding severance and other taxes and average sales prices for each of the countries where the company has operations 



1 includes production volumes attributable to a onethird noncontrolling interest in egypt 

2 sales volumes from the north sea for 2020  2019 and 2018 were 227 mmboe 218 mmboe and 203 mmboe respectively sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the beryl field 

gross and net undeveloped and developed acreage 

the following table summarizes the company’s gross and net acreage position as of december 31 2020 



as of december 31 2020 approximately 46 percent of us net undeveloped acreage was held by production 

as of december 31 2020 apache held 15 million net undeveloped acres that are scheduled to expire by yearend 2021 if production is not established or the company takes no action to extend the terms the company also held 533000 and 408000 net undeveloped acres set to expire by yearend 2022 and 2023 respectively the company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the company and third parties including governments 

exploration concessions in the company’s egypt asset comprise a significant portion of its expiring net undeveloped acreage with approximately 13 million 74000 and 343000 net undeveloped acres set to expire during 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively no oil and gas reserves were recorded on this undeveloped acreage set to expire the company will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist 

additionally the company has exploration interests in suriname consisting of 390000 net undeveloped acres in block 53 set to expire in 2022 contingent on planned drilling activity the company has acquired 3d seismic surveys over all acreages no oil and gas reserves have been recorded on this undeveloped acreage 

estimated proved reserves and future net cash flows 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas crude oil condensate and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods the company reports all estimated proved reserves held under productionsharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method which excludes the host country’s share of reserves 

estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed the costs of the operation reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been fieldtested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation in estimating its proved reserves apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy with similar properties apache will at times utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models petrophysical techniques and proprietary 3d seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the company’s reserve estimates 

proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period 

the following table shows proved oil ngl and gas reserves as of december 31 2020 based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2020 held flat for the life of the production except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms the total column of this table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl this ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products 



1 includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of 55 mmboe and 4 mmboe respectively attributable to a onethird noncontrolling interest in egypt 

as of december 31 2020 apache had total estimated proved reserves of 434 mmbbls of crude oil 169 mmbbls of ngls and 16 tcf of natural gas combined these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of 874 million barrels of oil or 52 tcf of natural gas of which oil represents 50 percent as of december 31 2020 the company’s proved developed reserves totaled 798 mmboe and estimated pud reserves totaled 76 mmboe or approximately 9 percent of worldwide total proved reserves apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing the company does not have any fields that contain 15 percent or more of its total proved reserves for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

during 2020 the company added 78 mmboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity partially offset by combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 45 mmboe engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 27 mmboe and downward revisions related to changes in product prices and interest accounted for 70 mmboe and 2 mmboe respectively the company also sold 10 mmboe of proved reserves associated with us divestitures primarily related to eastern shelf and magnet witherspickett ridge 

the company’s estimates of proved reserves proved developed reserves and pud reserves as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in note 18—supplemental oil and gas disclosures unaudited in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum end of period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months held flat for the life of the production except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements 

proved undeveloped reserves 

the company’s total estimated pud reserves of 76 mmboe as of december 31 2020 decreased by 42 mmboe from 118 mmboe of pud reserves reported at the end of 2019 during the year apache converted 35 mmboe of pud reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity in the us apache converted 25 mmboe with the remaining 10 mmboe in apache’s international areas apache did not sell any pud reserves in the us and did not acquire any pud reserves during the year apache added 43 mmboe of new pud reserves through extensions and discoveries apache did not recognize an upward engineering revision in proved undeveloped reserves during the year downward revisions included 1 mmboe associated with engineering and interest revisions 43 mmboe associated with revised development plans and 6 mmboe associated with product prices 

during the year a total of approximately 339 million was spent on projects associated with proved undeveloped reserves a portion of apache’s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will convert undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in future years during 2020 apache spent approximately 251 million on pud reserve development activity in the us and 88 million in the international areas as of december 31 2020 apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure 

preparation of oil and gas reserve information 

apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which by their very nature are subject to revision these estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward as warranted 

apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups these engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production costs net revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves all relevant data is compiled in a computer database application to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to apache’s board of directors in summary form on a quarterly basis annually each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating asset engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses netback prices production trends and development timing are reasonable 

apache’s executive vice president of development is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the company’s internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a thirdparty engineering firm he has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in petroleum engineering and over 30 years of experience in the energy industry and energy sector of the banking industry the executive vice president of development reports directly to the company’s chief executive officer 

the estimate of reserves disclosed in this annual report on form 10k is prepared by the company’s internal staff and the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates the company engages ryder scott company lp petroleum consultants ryder scott to conduct a reserves audit which includes a review of our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves the company selects the properties for review by ryder scott based primarily on relative reserve value the company also considers other factors such as geographic location new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume during 2020 the properties selected for each country ranged from 84 to 86 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent these properties also accounted for 84 percent of the value of apache’s international proved reserves and 94 percent of the value of apache’s new wells drilled worldwide in addition all fields containing five percent or more of the company’s total proved reserves volume were included in ryder scott’s review the review covered 81 percent of total proved reserves on a boe basis 

ryder scott’s review for the years 2020 2019 and 2018 covered 85 87 and 86 percent respectively of the value and 81 85 and 83 percent respectively of the volume of the company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves ryder scott’s 2020 review covered 80 82 and 83 percent of the estimated proved reserve volume in the us egypt and uk respectively 

ryder scott’s review of 2019 covered 85 percent of us 86 percent of egypt and 80 percent of the uk’s total proved reserves 

ryder scott’s review of 2018 covered 82 percent of us 85 percent of egypt and 81 percent of the uk’s total proved reserves 

the company has filed ryder scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

according to ryder scott’s opinion based on their review including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by apache the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current sec regulations and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by apache are in aggregate reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the society of petroleum engineers auditing standards 

altus midstream 

in november 2018 apache completed a transaction with altus midstream company and its then whollyowned subsidiary altus midstream lp collectively altus to create a pureplay permian basin midstream ccorporation anchored by gathering processing and transmission assets at alpine high pursuant to the agreement apache contributed certain alpine high midstream assets and options the pipeline options to acquire equity interests in five separate thirdparty pipeline projects the equity method interest pipelines to altus midstream lp andor its subsidiaries in exchange for the assets apache received economic voting and noneconomic voting shares in altus midstream company and limited partner interests in altus midstream lp representing an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in the combined entities 

apache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of altus in its consolidated financial statements with a corresponding noncontrolling interest reflected separately 

gathering processing and transmission assets 

altus owns develops and operates gas gathering processing and transmission assets in the permian basin of west texas altus generates revenue by providing feebased natural gas gathering compression processing and transmission services for apache’s production from its alpine high resource play as of december 31 2020 altus’ assets included approximately 182 miles of inservice natural gas gathering pipelines approximately 46 miles of residuegas pipelines with four market connections and approximately 38 miles of ngl pipelines three cryogenic processing trains each with nameplate capacity of 200 mmcfd were placed into service during 2019 other assets include an ngl truck loading terminal with six lease automatic custody transfer units and eight ngl bullet tanks with 90000 gallon capacity per tank altus’ existing gathering processing and transmission infrastructure is expected to provide capacity levels capable of fulfilling its midstream contracts to service apache’s production from alpine high and thirdparty customers as market activity in the area continues to develop

major customers 

the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties a significant portion of which are concentrated in energyrelated industries the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review including the use of master netting agreements where appropriate during 2020 sales to egpc and vitol accounted for approximately 17 percent and 14 percent respectively of the company’s worldwide crude oil natural gas and ngls production revenues during 2019 sales to bp and sinopec and their respective affiliates each accounted for approximately 10 percent and 11 percent respectively of the company’s worldwide crude oil natural gas and ngls production revenues during 2018 sales to bp sinopec and egpc and their respective affiliates each accounted for approximately 17 percent 15 percent and 10 percent respectively of the company’s worldwide crude oil natural gas and ngls production revenues 

management does not believe that the loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 

human capital management 

as a company apache believes its people are its greatest asset exploring what’s possible at apache is the union of curiosity intellect and hard work built on mutual respect honesty integrity and a keen sense of responsibility for the company’s team community and the environment with respect to its employees the company is focused on health and safety diversity and inclusion and total rewards so that joining the apache family is a positive experience for all 

in 2020 a major redesign of apache’s organizational structure and operations and the global covid19 pandemic had significant impacts on the company’s human capital management in connection with the organizational and operational redesign and changes in the economic environment in which apache operates the company offered voluntary retirement packages made reductionsinforce and began limiting hiring to critical business roles in response to the global covid19 pandemic apache implemented significant operating environment changes that the company determined were in the best interest of its employees and complied with government regulations these changes include having the vast majority of apache’s employees working from home while implementing additional safety protocols and procedures for essential employees continuing critical onsite work 

oversight and management 

apache’s board of directors has three standing committees each devoted to a separate aspect of risk oversight the corporate governance and nominating cgn committee the audit committee the management development and compensation mdc committee andor the full board of directors receive regular reports on certain human capital matters including the company’s diversity and inclusion programs and initiatives 

• the mdc committee oversees apaches compensation programs leadership development and succession planning strategies and seeks continuous improvement in the diversity and inclusion practices used in developing and deploying these processes 

• the audit committee oversees the integrity of the companys financial statements and monitors human capital management risk against compliance with legal and regulatory requirements 

• the cgn committee oversees the nomination of candidates for election to the board of directors the annual board of directors evaluation process corporate governance and environmental social and governance esg issues as well as the company’s annual sustainability report 

reports and recommendations made to the board of directors and its committees are part of the framework that ensures the company’s daily actions and decisions are guided by its core values including upholding the health and safety of apache’s team stakeholders and communities investing in its workforce ensuring environmental responsibility and acting ethically and with integrity 

covid19 response 

during the early stages of the pandemic apache called upon its crisis management team to lead and coordinate the companys overall covid19 pandemic response this team led efforts to develop and monitor mitigation and business continuity plans track all relevant country state and local government guidelines directives and regulations develop and adopt workfromhome plans implement safe working protocols for production teams assess and implement appropriate returntooffice protocols and provide timely and transparent communications to global employees and key stakeholders 

in response to the covid19 pandemic apache began providing the following benefits to its employees 

• covering the cost of covid19 testing at the company’s onsite testing events and through expanded insurance coverage 

• expanding telehealth benefits 

• promoting mental health and wellbeing plans 

• implementing enhanced hardship distributions and loan eligibility and repayment terms in the apache 401k savings plan and 

• providing additional paid sick leave for quarantined employees 

employee profile 

as of december 31 2020 apache had approximately 2272 fulltime equivalent employees in locations across the organization as follows 



the employment of approximately 637 employees globally were impacted by involuntary reductionsinforce in 2020 the impacted employees were provided severance packages that included companypaid benefits and outplacement services the voluntary workforce turnover for 2020 was 96 percent 

as of yearend 2020 apache’s global workforce was 221 percent female and 779 percent male and women represented 176 percent of leadership defined as supervisor level and above or equivalent in the us apache’s workforce selfidentified as 669 percent white 6 percent black 68 percent asian 186 percent hispanic and 17 percent other for the company’s us leadership the breakdown was 78 percent white 3 percent black 63 percent asian 113 percent hispanic and 14 percent other 

health and safety 

safety underpins the company’s core values and is at the forefront of decisionmaking at every level of the apache organization apache is committed to driving a safety culture that empowers its team to act as needed to work safely and to stop the job if conditions are deemed unsafe apache’s goal is to demonstrate a continual reduction in occupational safety and health administration osha recordable incidents year over year to this end the company’s annual osha recordable incident rate targets are set at a 10 percent reduction compared to the preceding 3year average during the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 the recordable incident count for the company declined by 21 percent compared to the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 

apache offers a wide range of training programs for employees and contractors to promote their full understanding of and compliance with the company’s health and safety policies and programs and to help build the skills needed to work safely in addition to providing specific skills these training programs encourage personal responsibility for safe operating conditions and help build a culture of individual accountability for conducting job tasks in a safe and responsible manner 

a few key highlights from 2020 

• egypt from drilling to driving safework behavior improved dramatically the jointventure drilling team had 55 percent fewer injuries in the second half of 2020 as compared to the first half of 2020 

• suriname with the complexities of working during the pandemic stringent health and safety protocols have kept personnel safe as they rotate offshore rewarding excellence the drilling team and noble sam croft drillship achieved one year without any recordable incidents 

• uk in an effort to connect teams with management apache’s elected safety representatives have increased workforce engagement around offshore operations and safety new platform meetings put safety at the forefront of conversations about performance accidents and hazards industry updates and valuable topics such as mental health 

• us despite economic pressures and pandemic challenges us onshore operations and asset teams performed exceptionally the southern midland basin legacy and delaware basin collectively achieved over 800 days without injuries 

diversity and inclusion

additional information about apache 

response plans and available resources 

apache and its wholly owned subsidiary apache deepwater llc adw developed oil spill response plans the plans for their respective gulf of mexico operations and offshore operations in the north sea and suriname which ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties annually drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the plans 

apache is a member of oil spill response limited osrl a large international oil spill response cooperative which entitles any apache entity worldwide to access osrl’s services apache also has a contract for response resources and services with national response corporation nrc nrc is the world’s largest commercial oil spill response organization and is the global leader in providing endtoend environmental industrial and emergency response solutions with operating bases in 13 countries 

in the event of a spill in the gulf of mexico clean gulf associates cga is the primary oil spill response association available to apache and adw both apache and adw are members of cga a notforprofit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the gulf of mexico cga was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the gulf of mexico 

additionally apache is an active member of wild well control’s wellcontained subsea containment system for suriname operations this membership includes contingency planning and response to an uncontrolled subsea well event apache utilizes a detailed source control emergency response plan scerp for offshore suriname planning the scerp has been designed to ensure that the goals of apache’s source control emergency preparedness efforts will be met in the unlikely event of an actual response to an uncontrolled well event this includes the use of subsea dispersant systems and field deployment of one of wild well control’s containment system capping stacks 

competitive conditions 

the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves the acquisition of oil and gas leases equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves and the gathering and marketing of oil gas and natural gas liquids our competitors include national oil companies major integrated oil and gas companies other independent oil and gas companies and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial commercial and individual consumers 

certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights 

however we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets which comprises large acreage positions and wellestablished production bases across three geographic areas our balanced production mix between oil and gas our management and incentive systems and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices local business environments and markets it also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country 

environmental compliance 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently to any material degree than other companies in our industry 

we have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry we have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business we have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations the costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters however we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 



our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks including those described below if any of such events should occur our business financial condition liquidity andor results of operations could be materially harmed and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectus supplements related to offerings of our securities from time to time in the future 

risks related to pricing demand and production for crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls 

the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact the company’s business financial condition and results of operations the global economy and the demand for and prices of oil natural gas and ngls the unprecedented nature of the current situation makes it impossible for the company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business 

the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic have adversely impacted the global economy and created significant volatility in the global financial markets business closures restrictions on travel “stayathome” or “shelterinplace” orders and other restrictions on movement within and among communities have significantly reduced demand for and the prices of oil natural gas and ngls as of the date of this report efforts to contain covid19 have not been successful in many regions vaccination programs have encountered delays and the global pandemic remains ongoing a continued prolonged period of such reduced demand the failure to timely distribute or the ineffectiveness of any vaccines the failure to develop adequate treatments and other adverse impacts from the pandemic may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

the company’s operations rely on its workforce being able to access its wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with its oil and gas leases additionally because the company has implemented remote working procedures for a significant portion of its workforce for health and safety reasons andor to comply with applicable national state andor local government requirements the company relies on such persons having sufficient access to its information technology systems including through telecommunication hardware software and networks if a significant portion of the company’s workforce cannot effectively perform their responsibilities whether resulting from a lack of physical or virtual access quarantines illnesses governmental actions or restrictions information technology or telecommunication failures or other restrictions or adverse impacts resulting from the pandemic the company’s business financial condition cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the unprecedented nature of the current situation resulting from the covid19 pandemic makes it impossible for the company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business financial condition cash flows or results of operations such results will depend on future events which the company cannot predict including the scope duration and potential reoccurrence of the covid19 pandemic or any other localized epidemic or global pandemic the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments the demand for and the prices of oil natural gas and ngls and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities customers contractors and suppliers in response to the covid19 pandemic or any other epidemics or pandemics the covid19 pandemic and its unprecedented consequences have amplified and may continue to amplify the other risks identified in this report 

crude oil natural gas and ngl price volatility could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock 

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil natural gas and ngl production historically the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future for example the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2020 ranged from a high of 6327 per barrel to a low of 3698 per barrel the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2020 ranged from a high of 314 per mmbtu to a low of 133 per mmbtu the market prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls depend on factors beyond our control these factors include demand which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors including 

• worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil natural gas and ngls 

• actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations including the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec 

• political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions 

• the occurrence of global events such as epidemics or pandemics including specifically the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by third parties including but not limited to governmental authorities customers contractors and suppliers in response to such epidemics or pandemics 

• the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories 

• the price and level of imported foreign crude oil natural gas and ngls 

• the price and availability of alternative fuels including coal and biofuels 

• the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure 

• the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity 

• weather conditions 

• domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes and 

• the overall economic environment 

our results of operations as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil natural gas and ngls despite slight increases in oil and natural gas prices in 2020 prices have remained significantly lower than levels seen in recent years which has adversely affected our revenues operating income cash flow and proved reserves continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures without the ability to fund capital expenditures we would be unable to replace reserves and production sustained low prices of crude oil natural gas and ngls may further adversely impact our business as follows 

• weakening our financial condition and reducing our liquidity 

• limiting our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations 

• reducing the amount of crude oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically 

• causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects 

• reducing our revenues operating income and cash flows 

• limiting our access to sources of capital such as equity and longterm debt 

• reducing the carrying value of our oil and gas properties resulting in additional noncash impairments or 

• reducing the carrying value of our gathering processing and transmission facilities resulting in additional impairments 

our ability to sell crude oil natural gas or ngls andor receive market prices for these commodities andor meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints the inability to procure and resell volumes economically and various transportation interruptions 

a portion of our crude oil natural gas and ngl production in any region may be interrupted limited or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons including as a result of weather conditions accidents loss of pipeline or gathering system access field labor issues or strikes or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems processing facilities or interstate pipelines to transport our production or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows additionally if we are unable to procure and resell thirdparty volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill 

drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically the costs of drilling completing and operating wells are often uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

• unexpected drilling conditions 

• pressure or irregularities in formations 

• equipment failures or accidents 

• fires explosions blowouts and surface cratering 

• marine risks such as capsizing collisions and hurricanes 

• other adverse weather conditions and 

• increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment 

future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while all drilling whether developmental or exploratory involves these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks 

to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which 

• our production falls short of the hedged volumes 

• there is a widening of pricebasis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement 

• the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements or 

• an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices 

risks related to operations and development projects 

our operations involve a high degree of operational risk particularly risk of personal injury damage to or loss of equipment and environmental accidents 

our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling production and transportation of crude oil natural gas and ngls including 

• well blowouts explosions and cratering 

• pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills 

• fires 

• formations with abnormal pressures 

• equipment malfunctions 

• hurricanes storms andor cyclones which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the gulf coast north sea and suriname and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions and 

• surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents saltwater or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives 

failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions cyberattacks or natural disasters such as hurricanes could result in property damages personal injury environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence such as a well blowout explosion fire at a location where our equipment and services are used or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses if a significant amount of our production is interrupted our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence our cash flows and in turn our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and production 

demand for oil and gas are to a significant degree dependent on weather and climate which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce in addition our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather such as freezing temperatures hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or storms in the north sea which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment our planning for normal climatic variation insurance programs and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions and not all such effects can be predicted eliminated or insured against 

our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face which could result in significant financial exposure 

exploration for and production of crude oil natural gas and ngls can be hazardous involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts cratering fires explosions and loss of well control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment our international operations are also subject to political risk the insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability moreover insurance is not available to us against all operational risks 

a terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by us or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations 

our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development and production activities we depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves process and record financial and operating data analyze seismic and drilling information communicate with our employees and thirdparty partners and conduct many of our activities unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption data corruption communication interruption loss of intellectual property loss of confidential and fiduciary data and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information also external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the united states and abroad which are necessary to transport and market our production a cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions any such terrorist attack environmental activist group activity or cyberattack that affects the company or our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business cause us to incur a material financial loss subject us to possible legal claims and liability andor damage our reputation 

while certain of our insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur 

while we have experienced cyberattacks in the past we have not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks however there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future further as cyberattacks continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in addition cyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures the company cannot predict the potential impact that such additional regulations could have on our business and operations or the energy industry at large 

material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects 

we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies weather conditions manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment and other unforeseen events delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in largescale development projects in the future in addition our estimates of future development costs are based on our current expectations of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate if costs become too high our development projects may become uneconomic to us and we may be forced to abandon such development projects 

risks related to reserves and leasehold acreage 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted while related perunit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities identify additional behindpipe zones secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced future oil and gas production is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis furthermore if oil or gas prices increase our cost for additional reserves could also increase 

we may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves 

although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices such reviews are inherently incomplete it generally is not feasible to review indepth every individual property involved in each acquisition ordinarily we will focus our review efforts on the highervalue properties and will sample the remainder however even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates in addition there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations 

crude oil natural gas and ngl reserves are estimates and actual recoveries may vary significantly 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil natural gas and ngl reserves and their value reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil natural gas and ngls that cannot be measured in an exact manner because of the high degree of judgment involved the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation our reserves estimates are based on 12month average prices except where contractual arrangements exist therefore reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease in addition results of drilling testing and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time the estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results including 

• historical production from the area compared with production from other areas 

• the effects of regulations by governmental agencies including changes to severance and excise taxes 

• future operating costs and capital expenditures and 

• workover and remediation costs 

for these reasons estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls attributable to any particular group of properties classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially accordingly reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment and actual production revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary possibly materially from estimates 

additionally because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure in addition realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 

certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage 

a sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms the leases will expire if our leases expire we will lose our right to develop the related properties our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors including drilling results commodity prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs availability of drilling services and equipment gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 

risks related to counterparties 

the credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us 

we are party to numerous transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including commercial banks investment banks insurance companies other investment funds and other institutions these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us we may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges we also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies in addition if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under our credit facilities 

we are exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract this risk of counterparty nonperformance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in commodity prices which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract we are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform even if we do accurately predict sudden changes our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities during periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase which increases our exposure if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance we could incur a significant loss 

the distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs 

concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil natural gas and ngl prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry we are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade joint venture joint interest billing and other receivables we sell our crude oil natural gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers as operator we pay expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of costs as a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in commodity prices some of our customers and nonoperating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or nonoperating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or nonoperating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by 

the distressed entity or entities nonperformance by a trade creditor or nonoperating partner could result in significant financial losses 

our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case 

from time to time we have divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets the agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions indemnities escrows trusts and similar arrangements one of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by us one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress in the event that any such counterparty were to become the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11 of the united states code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law which we collectively refer to as insolvency laws the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions in that case our remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations resolution of our claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise pending final resolution of the proceeding 

despite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations we would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require us to perform and hold us responsible for such liabilities and obligations in such event we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise 

if a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions or any similar determination or action it could adversely impact our cash flows operations or financial condition 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations 

we conduct many of our exploration and production ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not an operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made that we do not believe are in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected

risks related to capital markets 

a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital 

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix commodity pricing levels and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt during 2020 our credit rating was downgraded by moody’s to ba1negative and by standard and poor’s to bbnegative these and other past ratings downgrades have required and any future downgrades may require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations 

market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs which may limit our financial flexibility 

the financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks we have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio which will require substantial future investment we andor our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities our future access to capital as well as that of our partners and contractors could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained this could significantly delay development of our property interests 

our syndicated credit facility currently matures in march 2024 there is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future agreements will make loans or other extensions of credit available to apache or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders 

the discontinuation and uncertain cessation date of libor and the adoption of an alternative reference rate may have a material adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs 

pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility 1 we may elect to use london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings and 2 the commission payable to the lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit uses libor as a benchmark on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration iba announced that it intends to continue publishing libor until the end of june 2023 beyond the previously announced 2021 cessation date the iba announcement was supported by announcements from the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor and the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal deposit insurance corporation and office of the comptroller of the currency us regulators however both the fca and us regulators in their announcements also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing libor after december 2021 these announcements indicate that the continuation of libor on the current basis may not be assured after 2021 and will not be assured beyond 2023 in light of these recent announcements the future of libor at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or regulatory activity related to libor’s phaseout could cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist 

in the united states the alternative reference rates committee the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to libor has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative rate for libor there can be no guarantee that sofr will become a widelyaccepted benchmark in place of libor although the full impact of the transition away from libor including the discontinuance of libor publication and the adoption of sofr as the replacement rate for libor remains unclear these changes may have an adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs under our revolving credit facility 

our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations 

the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors which considers among other factors our operating results overall financial condition creditrisk considerations and capital requirements as well as general business and market conditions our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends 

any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock including our common stock in addition under delaware law dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus” which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities including contingent liabilities and the amount of our capital if there is no surplus cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid 

from our net profits for the thencurrent andor the preceding fiscal year further even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock 

risks related to financial results 

future economic conditions in the us and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results 

current global market conditions and uncertainty including the economic instability in europe and certain emerging markets are likely to have significant longterm effects on our operating results global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources including fossil fuels a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our oil and gas production as well as lower commodity prices which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability 

we face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas ep industry we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases properties and reserves equipment and labor required to explore develop and operate those properties and marketing of crude oil natural gas and ngl production crude oil natural gas and ngl prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel including geologists geophysicists engineers and other specialists these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

the company’s ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income may be limited if the company experiences an ownership change 

as described in note 10—income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards nols and other tax attributes available to potentially offset future taxable income if the company were to experience an “ownership change” under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change by value in the company’s equity ownership by fivepercent shareholders over a threeyear period the company’s ability to utilize its prechange nols and other prechange tax attributes to potentially offset its postchange income or taxes may be limited such a limitation could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results or cash flows by effectively increasing its future tax obligations 

risks related to governmental regulation and political risks 

we may incur significant costs related to environmental matters 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages limit or constrain operations in affected areas and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations in addition it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition 

our united states operations are subject to governmental risks 

our united states operations have been and at times in the future may be affected by political developments and by federal state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production changes in taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection laws and regulations 

in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the us gulf of mexico in april 2010 and as directed by the secretary of the us department of the interior the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety environmental matters drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the gulf of mexico these regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the gulf of mexico 

with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico the boem issued a notice to lessees ntl no 2016n01 significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases while the ntl was paused in mid2017 and is currently listed on boem’s website as “rescinded” if reinstated the ntl will likely require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations relating to apache’s current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases we are working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security if such security becomes necessary under the ntl additionally we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern 

new political developments the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting our united states operations and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations 

changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business 

certain countries where we operate including the united kingdom either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas ghg related fees on our operations exposure has not been material to date although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations additionally there has been discussion in other countries where we operate including the united states regarding legislation or regulation of ghg any such legislation or regulation if enacted could either tax or assess some form of ghgrelated fees on our operations and could lead to increased operating expenses or cause us to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications 

in the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change do transpire we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations however any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing waste disposal oil spills and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja was signed into law in addition to reducing the us corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 certain provisions in the tcja move the us away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income the new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime the tcja also includes provisions which could impact or limit the company’s ability to deduct interest expense or utilize net operating losses 

the us federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration development and extraction may be further modified by administrative legislative or judicial interpretation at any time previous legislative proposals if enacted into law could make significant changes to such laws including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies these changes include but are not limited to i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and iii an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures the passage or adoption of these changes or similar changes could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted any such changes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

proposed federal state or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs 

several proposals are before the us congress that if implemented would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation ballot initiatives executive orders or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting transparency and well construction requirements on hydraulicfracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity in addition some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities andor hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so we routinely use fracturing techniques in the us and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore it is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability 

although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the us 

risks related to international operations 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

our operations outside the united states are based primarily in egypt and the united kingdom on a barrel equivalent basis approximately 42 percent of our 2020 production was outside the united states and approximately 33 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of december 31 2020 were located outside the united states as a result a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including but not limited to 

• general strikes and civil unrest 

• the risk of war acts of terrorism expropriation and resource nationalization and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts 

• import and export regulations 

• taxation policies including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims and investment restrictions 

• price control 

• transportation regulations and tariffs 

• constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area 

• exchange controls currency fluctuations devaluations or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds 

• laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade including trade sanctions 

• the effects of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the british pound 

• the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate 

• the possible inability to subject foreign persons especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states and 

• difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations 

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country our interests could decrease in value or be lost even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability 

the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities as have occurred in countries and regions in which we operate may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities 

a deterioration of conditions in egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in egypt could have an adverse impact on our business 

deterioration in the political economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the egyptian government such as changes in laws or regulations export restrictions expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization andor forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with egpc or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our operations in egypt excluding the impacts of a onethird noncontrolling interest contributed 20 percent of our 2020 production and accounted for 15 percent of our yearend estimated proved reserves and 24 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows 

our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations 

our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly between the us dollar and the british pound our financial statements presented in us dollars may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations particularly through the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies 

risks related to the planned holding company reorganization 

if the holding company reorganization is implemented apa corporation as the parent holding company of apache will be dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries including apache 

if the holding company reorganization is implemented apa corporation will become the successor issuer to and parent holding company of apache apa corporation will have no business operations of its own apa corporation’s only significant assets will be the outstanding equity interests of its subsidiaries including apache as a result apa corporation will rely on cash flows from apache to pay dividends with respect to its common stock and to meet its financial obligations including to service any debt obligations that apa corporation may incur from time to time legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing future indebtedness of apache as well as apache’s financial condition and future operating 

requirements may limit apache’s ability to distribute cash to apa corporation if apache is limited in its ability to distribute cash to apa corporation or if apache’s earnings or other available assets of are not sufficient to pay distributions or make loans to apa corporation in the amounts or at the times necessary for apa corporation to pay dividends with respect to its common stock andor to meet its financial obligations then apa corporation’s business financial condition cash flows results of operations and reputation may be materially adversely affected 

if the holding company reorganization is implemented apa corporation may not obtain the anticipated benefits of the reorganization into a holding company structure 

if the holding company reorganization is implemented we believe that our new operating structure will allow us to focus on running our diverse businesses independently with the goal of maximizing each of the business’ potential however the anticipated benefits of the planned holding company reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent us from taking advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that we expect it may afford us as a result we may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

management is dedicating significant effort to the new operating structure these efforts may divert management’s focus and resources from the company’s operations strategic initiatives or development opportunities which could adversely affect our prospects business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

general risk factors 

certain antitakeover provisions in our charter and delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights dividend rates liquidation preferences conversion rights redemption rights including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock in addition delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock these provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders

overview 

apache corporation a delaware corporation formed in 1954 is an independent energy company that explores for develops and produces natural gas crude oil and ngls the company’s upstream business currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas the us egypt and offshore the uk in the north sea north sea apache also has active exploration and planned appraisal operations ongoing in suriname as well as interests in other international locations that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities apache’s midstream business is operated by altus midstream company nasdaq altm through its subsidiary altus midstream lp collectively altus altus owns develops and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas 

apache’s mission is to grow in an innovative safe environmentally responsible and profitable manner for the longterm benefit of its stakeholders apache is focused on rigorous portfolio management disciplined financial structure and optimization of returns 

the global economy and the energy industry have been deeply impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related thirdparty actions uncertainty in the oil markets and the negative demand implications from the covid19 pandemic continue to impact oil supply and demand as with previous changes in a volatile price environment apache has continued to respond quickly and decisively taking the following actions 

• establishing and implementing a wide range of fitforpurpose protocols and procedures to ensure a safe and productive work environment across the company’s diversified global onshore and offshore operations 

• reducing upstream capital investments by over 50 percent from the comparative prioryear period including eliminating nearly all us drilling and completion activity by may 2020 and reducing planned activity in egypt and the north sea 

• decreasing the company’s dividend by 90 percent beginning in the first quarter of 2020 preserving approximately 340 million of cash flow on an annualized basis and strengthening liquidity 

• completing an organizational redesign focused on centralizing certain operational activities in an effort to capture greater efficiencies achieving an estimated cost savings of 400 million annually 

• conducting on a continuous basis price sensitivity analyses and operational evaluations of producing wells across the company’s portfolio that allow for a methodical and integrated approach to production shutins and curtailments with a focus on preserving cash flows in a distressed price environment and protecting the company’s assets 

the company remains committed to its longerterm objectives 1 to maintain a balanced asset portfolio including advancement of ongoing exploration and appraisal activities offshore suriname 2 to invest for longterm returns over production growth and 3 to budget conservatively to generate excess cash flow that can be directed on a priority basis to debt reduction the company closely monitors hydrocarbon pricing fundamentals and will reallocate capital as part of its ongoing planning process for additional detail on the company’s forward capital investment outlook refer to “capital and operational outlook” below 

during 2020 apache reported a net loss attributable to common stock of 49 billion or 1286 per share compared to a net loss of 36 billion or 943 per share in 2019 the results for both periods were driven by asset impairments in 2020 the company recorded impairments totaling 45 billion in connection with fair value assessments stemming from the global crude oil price collapse on lower demand and economic activity resulting from the impacts of covid19 and related thirdparty actions the company recorded asset impairments during 2019 of 29 billion primarily related to a material reduction in planned investment at apache’s alpine high development that triggered fair value assessments of the company’s upstream alpine high proved properties and altus’ associated midstream assets 

apache’s capital spending for the year aligned with its 14 billion of cash from operating activities generated in 2020 which was 15 billion or 52 percent lower than the prior year apache’s lower operating cash flows for 2020 were driven by lower crude oil prices and associated revenues the reduced capital investment was the result of proactive measures taken by the company to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows apache ended the year with a slightly higher cash balance of 262 million and comparable debt levels to the prior yearend while actively managing its debt positions to reduce nearterm debt maturities 

operational highlights 

key operational highlights for the year include 

united states 

• equivalent production from the company’s us assets which accounted for 58 percent of total production during 2020 decreased nine percent from 2019 to 2020 as a result of reduced activity in response to commodity price weakness 

• the company began 2020 with seven operated drilling rigs and three operated completion crews in the permian basin which were both quickly and safely reduced to zero by may 2020 in response to commodity price weakness 

• in response to completion cost reductions when compared to the first quarter of 2020 the company reinstated two operated completion crews in the permian basin during the fourth quarter of 2020 to begin completing its backlog of drilled but uncompleted well inventory 

international 

• egypt gross equivalent production decreased 13 percent and net production decreased 9 percent from 2019 primarily a result of natural decline given reduced drilling activity during the year the company continues to build and enhance its robust drilling inventory in egypt supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations on both new and existing acreage as a result the egypt asset achieved a new record within the matruh basin with the herunefer e2 well which encountered 555 feet of net pay 

• the north sea maintained two drilling rigs during 2020 with notable discoveries at the storr and garten fields contributing to the two percent increase in production from 2019 to 2020 in addition during the fourth quarter of 2020 the company’s losgann well confirmed a tertiary oil discovery offsetting other operator norwegian discoveries in the area in combination with two previous undeveloped apache discoveries in the tertiary losgann will add to a comprehensive development opportunity 

• in april 2020 apache announced a significant oil discovery at the sapakara west1 well drilled offshore suriname on block 58 sapakara west1 was drilled to a depth of approximately 6300 meters approximately 20700 feet and successfully tested for the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper cretaceousaged campanian and santonian intervals this follows the january 2020 announcement of a discovery at the maka central1 well during 2020 the company submitted a plan of appraisal for both of these discoveries apache holds a 50 percent working interest in block 58 

• in july 2020 apache announced a major oil discovery at the kwaskwasi1 well drilled offshore suriname on block 58 kwaskwasi1 was drilled to a depth of approximately 6645 meters approximately 21800 feet and successfully tested for the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper cretaceousaged campanian and santonian intervals fluid samples and test results indicate at least 278 meters approximately 912 feet of net oil and oilgas condensate pay in two intervals this was the third consecutive oil discovery offshore suriname 

• in late 2020 the company commenced drilling a fourth exploration well in the block at the keskesi prospect in january 2021 apache and total sa announced a discovery that confirmed oil in the eastern portion of the block the keskesi east1 well is continuing to drill to deeper targets apache is transferring operatorship of block 58 to its partner total sa which will conduct all exploration and appraisal activities subsequent to completion of drilling operations at keskesi

acquisition and divestiture activity 

over apache’s history the company has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions a key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize apache’s portfolio of assets in response to these changes most recently apache has completed a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance apache’s portfolio in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities these divestitures include 

• us leasehold divestitures  other during 2020 the company completed the sale of certain noncore producing assets and leasehold acreage primarily in the permian basin in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of 87 million the company also completed certain leasehold and property acquisitions primarily in the permian basin for total cash consideration of 4 million 

• suriname joint venture agreement in december 2019 apache entered into a joint venture agreement with total sa to explore and develop block 58 offshore suriname under the terms of the agreement apache and total sa each hold a 50 percent working interest in block 58 apache operated the drilling of the first four wells and subsequently transferred operatorship of block 58 to total sa in connection with the agreement apache received 100 million upon closing in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 79 million upon satisfying certain closing conditions in the first quarter of 2020 for reimbursement of 50 percent of all costs incurred on block 58 as of december 31 2019 

apache will also receive various other forms of consideration including 50 billion of cash carry on apache’s first 75 billion of appraisal and development capital 25 percent cash carry on all of apache’s appraisal and development capital beyond the first 75 billion a 75 million cash payment upon achieving first oil production and future contingent royalty payments from successful joint development projects 

• midcontinentgulf coast divestiture in the second quarter of 2019 apache completed the sale of noncore gasweighted assets in the woodfordscoop and stack plays for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately 223 million in the third quarter of 2019 apache completed the sale of noncore gasweighted assets in the western anadarko basin of oklahoma and texas for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately 322 million and the assumption of asset retirement obligations of 49 million 

• us leasehold divestitures  other during 2019 the company also completed the sale of certain other noncore producing assets gathering processing and transmission gpt assets and leasehold acreage primarily in the permian basin in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of 73 million

results of operations 

oil and gas production revenues 

apache’s oil and gas production revenues and respective contribution to total revenues by country are as follows 



1 includes revenues attributable to a noncontrolling interest in egypt 

production 

the following table presents production volumes by country 



1 gross oil natural gas and ngl production in egypt were as follows 



2 includes net production volumes per day attributable to a noncontrolling interest in egypt of 



3 the table shows production on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a 61 energy equivalent ratio this ratio is not reflective of the price ratio between the two products 

4 average sales volumes from the north sea were 62157 boed 59797 boed and 55568 boed for 2020  2019 and 2018 respectively sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the beryl field 

pricing 

the following table presents pricing information by country 



crude oil prices a substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the company’s control average realized crude oil prices for 2020 were down 34 percent compared to 2019 a direct result of the decreasing benchmark oil prices over the past year resulting from the covid19 pandemic and related thirdparty actions crude oil prices realized in 2020 averaged 3960 per barrel 

continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of the company’s asset portfolio while the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas crude oil tends to trade within a global market price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction 

natural gas prices natural gas which currently has a limited global transportation system is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions apache’s primary markets include north america egypt and the uk an overview of the market conditions in the company’s primary gasproducing regions follows

the company’s worldwide crude oil production decreased 25 mbd compared to 2019 primarily driven by natural decline in the us and egypt a result of reduced activity in response to commodity price weakness production decreases for 2020 were partially offset by the storr and garten exploration discoveries in the north sea coming online in late 2019 and early 2020 respectively 

natural gas revenues   

natural gas revenues for 2020 totaled 598 million an 80 million decrease from the 2019 total of 678 million a 4 percent decrease in average realized prices reduced 2020 revenues by 24 million compared to 2019 while 9 percent lower average daily production decreased revenues by 56 million average daily production in 2020 was 893 mmcfd with prices averaging 183 per mcf natural gas sales accounted for 15 percent of the company’s 2020 oil and gas production revenues and 34 percent of its worldwide production 

the company’s worldwide natural gas production decreased 87 mmcfd compared to 2019 primarily a result of the sale of the company’s woodfordscoop and stack plays and western anadarko basin assets in the us in 2019 and natural decline in the us and egypt resulting from reduced activity levels 

ngl revenues   

ngl revenues for 2020 totaled 333 million a 74 million decrease from the 2019 total of 407 million a 25 percent decrease in average realized prices reduced 2020 revenues by 101 million compared to 2019 while 8 percent higher average daily production increased revenues by 27 million average daily production in 2020 was 77 mbd with prices averaging 1184 per barrel ngl sales accounted for 8 percent of apache’s 2020 oil and gas production revenues and 17 percent of its worldwide production 

the company’s worldwide ngl production increased 6 mbd compared to 2019 primarily a result of the alpine high development in recent years 

altus midstream revenues 

apache beneficially owns approximately 79 percent of altus’ outstanding voting common stock altus owns and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas primarily to service apache’s production from its alpine high resource play which commenced production in may 2017 

altus midstream generates revenue by providing feebased natural gas gathering compression processing and transmission services for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 altus midstream’s services revenues generated through its feebased contractual arrangements with apache totaled 145 million and 136 million respectively these affiliated revenues are eliminated upon consolidation the increase compared to the prior year was primarily driven by higher throughput of rich natural gas volumes at alpine high due to increased capacity as a result of three cryogenic processing trains coming on line starting in the second quarter of 2019 partially offset by lower throughput of lean natural gas volumes 

purchased oil and gas sales 

purchased oil and gas sales increased 222 million for the year ended december 31 2020 from 176 million to 398 million purchased oil and gas sales were primarily offset by associated purchase costs of 357 million and 142 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

operating expenses 

the table below presents a comparison of the company’s operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 all operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in egypt and altus 



lease operating expenses loe 

loe includes several key components such as direct operating costs repairs and maintenance and workover costs direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties ie offshore onshore remote locations etc fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly they directly impact costs such as power fuel and chemicals which are commodity price based commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates labor boats helicopters materials and supplies crude oil which accounted for 49 percent of the company’s total 2020 production is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties 

during 2020 loe decreased 320 million or 22 percent compared to 2019 on a perboe basis loe decreased 138 or 16 percent compared to 2019 from 838 per boe to 700 per boe driven by reduced activity labor costs and fuel costs associated with lower commodity prices the company’s organizational redesign and other cost cutting efforts in addition absolute dollar costs are lower in the current year as a result of the divestitures of the company’s woodfordscoop and stack plays and western anadarko basin assets in the us in the third quarter of 2019 

gathering processing and transmission gpt 

gpt expenses include amounts paid to thirdparty carriers and to altus midstream for gathering and transmission services for apache’s upstream natural gas production associated with its alpine high play gpt expenses also include midstream operating costs incurred by altus midstream the following table presents a summary of these expenses 



gpt costs decreased 32 million compared to 2019 thirdparty processing and transmission costs decreased 14 million primarily driven by a decrease in contracted pricing and the company’s sale of noncore assets in oklahoma and texas midstream service affiliate costs increased 9 million compared to 2019 primarily driven by higher throughput of rich natural gas volumes at alpine high midstream operating expenses incurred primarily by altus decreased 18 million compared to 2019 primarily driven by increased operational efficiency as a result of transitioning from mechanical refrigeration units to altus’ centralized diamond cryogenic complex starting in the second quarter of 2019 the transition resulted in decreases in employeerelated costs contract labor supplies expenses and equipment rentals 

purchased oil and gas costs 

purchased oil and gas costs increased 215 million compared to 2019 and were more than offset by associated sales totaling 398 million for the year ended 2020 

taxes other than incom e 

taxes other than income primarily consist of severance taxes on onshore properties and in state waters off the coast of the us and ad valorem taxes on us properties severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues the company is also subject to a variety of other taxes including us franchise taxes 

taxes other than income decreased 84 million compared to 2019 primarily from lower severance taxes driven by lower commodity prices and the divestiture of the company’s noncore assets in oklahoma and texas 

exploration expenses 

exploration expenses include unproved leasehold impairments exploration dry hole expense geological and geophysical expenses and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties the following table presents a summary of these expenses 



exploration expenses decreased 531 million compared to 2019 unproved leasehold impairments decreased 518 million driven by higher leasehold impairments in 2019 associated with the company’s decision to reallocate capital away from planned investment in the alpine high play dry hole expense increased 53 million compared to 2019 primarily related to exploration wells in the us egypt and the north sea geological and geophysical expenses decreased 39 million and exploration overhead and other expenses decreased 27 million the 2019 period reflects largescale seismic surveys in egypt and higher delay rentals in the us 

general and administrative ga expenses 

ga expenses decreased 116 million compared to 2019 primarily related to costcutting measures associated with the company’s organizational redesign efforts as well as lower cashbased stock compensation expense resulting from a decrease in the company’s stock price and a reduced payout of performance awards 

transaction reorganization and separation trs costs 

trs costs increased 4 million compared to 2019 driven by costs associated with the company’s reorganization efforts initiated in the second half of 2019 

in recent years the company has streamlined its portfolio through strategic divestitures and centralized certain operational activities in an effort to capture greater efficiencies and cost savings through shared services during the second half of 2019 management initiated a comprehensive redesign of apache’s organizational structure and operations that it believes will better position the company to be competitive for the longterm and further reduce recurring costs reorganization efforts were substantially completed in 2020 and as a result of the reorganization apache has achieved an estimated cost savings of more than 400 million annually 

depreciation depletion and amortization dda 

dda expenses on the company’s oil and gas property for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 869 million compared to 2019 the company’s oil and gas property dda rate decreased 435 per boe in 2020 compared to 2019 from 1455 per boe to 1020 per boe the decrease was driven by lower production volumes and lower asset property balances associated with proved property impairments recorded in the first quarter of 2020 and in the fourth quarter of 2019 dda expense on the company’s gpt depreciation decreased 29 million compared to 2019 driven by impairment charges recorded against the carrying value of altus’ gpt facilities in the fourth quarter of 2019 

impairments 

during 2020 the company recorded asset impairments in connection with fair value assessments totaling 45 billion including 43 billion for oil and gas proved properties in the us egypt and the north sea 68 million for gpt facilities in egypt 87 million for goodwill in egypt and 27 million for inventory and other miscellaneous assets including lease assets and charges for the early termination of drilling rig leases 

during 2019 the company recorded asset impairments totaling 29 billion in connection with fair value assessments including 15 billion for oil and gas proved properties in the us primarily in alpine high 13 billion impairment of gpt facilities primarily in the altus midstream reporting segment 149 million on divested unproved properties and leasehold acreage in the western anadarko basin in oklahoma and texas and 21 million of inventory and other miscellaneous assets including office leasehold impairments from apache’s announcement to close its san antonio regional office the impairments for alpine high and altus midstream were associated with the company’s fourth quarter 2019 capital plan allocation decision to materially reduce planned investment in the alpine high play 

the following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded for 2020 2019 and 2018 



financing costs net 

financing costs incurred during the period comprised the following 



net financing costs decreased 195 million compared to 2019 primarily the result of a 160 million gain on extinguishment of debt during 2020 compared to a 75 million loss on extinguishment of debt during 2019 in addition capitalized interest decreased in the current year as a result of lower drilling activity and construction activity at alpine high 

provision for income taxes 

income tax expense decreased 610 million from 674 million during 2019 to 64 million during 2020 the company’s yeartodate 2020 effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by oil and gas asset impairments a goodwill impairment and an increase in the amount of valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets the company’s yeartodate 2019 effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by an increase in the amount of valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets 

the company recorded a full valuation allowance against its us net deferred tax assets and will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on its us net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance for additional information regarding income taxes refer to note 10—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

apache and its subsidiaries are subject to us federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions the company’s tax reserves are related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the relevant taxing authority the company is currently under audit by the internal revenue service irs for the 20142017 tax years and is also under audit in various states and foreign jurisdictions as part of its normal course of business 

capital and operational outlook 

the company continues to prudently manage its capital program against a volatile price environment and the prolonged effects of the covid19 pandemic in response to the current crises apache’s immediate course of action has been to actively reduce its cost structure protect its balance sheet and manage operations to preserve cash flow the company plans to maintain a conservative investment approach into 2021 having announced an upstream capital program of 11 billion the program consists of approximately 900 million for development activities and approximately 200 million for exploration predominantly in suriname 

the 2021 capital program assumes an average wti price of 45 per barrel and a henry hub natural gas price of 300 per mcf in 2020 a higher percentage of development capital was directed toward international projects that generate better returns in a lower price environment with the improvement in oil prices the company is returning to a modest level of activity in the us under the capital budget for 2021 activity includes 

• continuing to advance exploratory and appraisal programs in suriname under the terms of the company’s joint venture with total sa 

• running one rig in the permian basin with the expectation to add a second rig in the middle of the year while resuming completion activity for its previously drilled but uncompleted well inventory in response to significantly lower service costs 

• continuing to run a five rig drilling program in egypt with the ability to quickly flex spending as conditions warrant and 

• maintaining a capital program in the north sea relatively unchanged from the prior year with one floating rig and one platform crew 

the company’s proactive reduction in capital spending in 2020 directly impacted global oil volumes which decreased by 17 percent from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020 based on its 2021 upstream investment plan and allocation the company is projecting a more moderate decline of one percent for the comparable 2021 period forecasting into 2022 and future years apache’s goal is to establish a development capital investment budget that will at a minimum at least sustain production volumes for the longerterm 

apache’s strategic approach and multiyear outlook prioritizes retaining cash flow to reduce outstanding debt focusing on longterm returns over shortterm growth aggressively managing its cost structure and advancing exploration and appraisal activities in suriname 

the company’s diversified global portfolio provides the ability to quickly optimize capital allocation as market conditions change the current crisis however is still evolving and may become more severe and complex as a result the covid19 pandemic may still materially and adversely affect apache’s results in a manner that is either not currently known or that the company does not currently consider to be a significant risk to its business for additional information about the business risks relating to the covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions refer to part i item 1a—risk factors of this annual report on form 10k 

separate from the company’s upstream oil and gas activities capital spending for altus’ gathering and processing assets totaled 28 million in 2020 down from 327 million in 2019 when a majority of the midstream infrastructure construction was completed altus management believes its existing gathering processing and transmission infrastructure capacity is capable of fulfilling its midstream contracts to service apache’s production from alpine high and any thirdparty customers as such remaining capital requirements for its existing infrastructure assets during 2021 and 2022 are anticipated to be minimal 

additionally during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 altus made cash contributions totaling 327 million and 501 million respectively for its equity interests in the following equity method interest pipelines 

• 16 percent in the gulf coast express natural gas pipeline gcx 

• 15 percent in the epic crude pipeline epic 

• an approximate 267 percent in the permian highway natural gas pipeline php and 

• 33 percent in the shin oak ngl pipeline shin oak 

altus estimates it will incur approximately 30 million of additional capital contributions during 2021 for its equity interest associated with the commissioning and remaining construction costs in the equity method interest pipelines primarily associated with php during 2020 altus’ primary sources of cash were borrowings under the revolving credit facility cash generated from operations distributions from the equity method interest pipelines and proceeds from the sale of assets based on altus’ current financial plan and related assumptions it believes that cash from operations a reduced capital program for its midstream infrastructure and distributions from equity method interests will generate cash flows significantly in excess of capital expenditures that will provide sufficient cash to fund its planned dividend program during 2021 

for further information on the equity method interest pipelines refer to note 6 —equity method interests in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

capital resources and liquidity 

operating cash flows are the company’s primary source of liquidity apache’s operating cash flows both in the shortterm and the longterm are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices as well as costs and sales volumes significant changes in commodity prices impact apache’s revenues earnings and cash flows these changes potentially impact apache’s liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices historically costs have trended with commodity prices albeit on a lag sales volumes also impact cash flows however they have a less volatile impact in the short term 

apache’s longterm operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of apache’s drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves for the year ended december 31 2020 apache recognized negative reserve revisions of approximately 7 percent of its yearend 2019 estimated proved reserves as a result of lower prices the company’s estimates of proved reserves proved developed reserves and pud reserves as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in note 18—supplemental oil and gas disclosures unaudited in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget decrease its dividend protect further downside price risk through entering into new hedge positions and reduce its operating cost structure in the current volatile commodity price environment apache believes the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to the company will be adequate to fund its operations and provide flexibility until commodity prices and industry conditions improve this includes supporting the company’s capital development program repayment of debt maturities payment of dividends and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies 

the company may also elect to utilize available cash on hand committed borrowing capacity access to both debt and equity capital markets or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs

in november 2018 altus midstream lp entered into a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes that matures in november 2023 subject to altus midstream lp’s two oneyear extension options the agreement for this facility as amended provides aggregate commitments from a syndicate of banks of 800 million all aggregate commitments include a letter of credit subfacility of up to 100 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to 100 million altus midstream lp may increase commitments up to an aggregate 15 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders as of december 31 2020 and 2019 there were 624 million and 396 million respectively of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under this facility 

the agreement for altus midstream lp’s credit facility as amended restricts distributions in respect of capital to apache and other unit holders in certain circumstances unless the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 400100 the agreement limits such distributions to 30 million per calendar year until either i the consolidated net income of altus midstream lp and its restricted subsidiaries as adjusted pursuant to the agreement for three consecutive calendar months equals or exceeds 3500 million on an annualized basis or ii altus midstream lp has a specified senior longterm debt rating in addition before the occurrence of one of those two events the leverage ratio must be less than or equal to 500100 in no event can any distribution be made that would after giving effect to it on a pro forma basis result in a leverage ratio greater than i 500100 or ii for a specified period after a qualifying acquisition 550100 the leverage ratio is the ratio of 1 the consolidated indebtedness of altus midstream lp and its restricted subsidiaries to 2 ebitda as defined in the agreement of altus midstream lp and its restricted subsidiaries for the 12month period ending immediately before the determination date the leverage ratio as of december 31 2020 was less than 400100 

the terms of altus midstream lp’s series a cumulative redeemable preferred units also contain certain restrictions on distributions in respect of capital including the common units held by apache and any other units that rank junior to the preferred units with respect to distributions or distributions upon liquidation refer to note 13—redeemable noncontrolling interest  altus set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further information in addition the amount of any cash distributions to altus midstream lp by any entity in which it has an interest accounted for by the equity method is subject to such entity’s compliance with the terms of any debt or other agreements by which it may be bound which in turn may impact the amount of funds available for distribution by altus midstream lp to its partners 

the altus midstream lp credit facility is unsecured and is not guaranteed by apache or any of apache’s other subsidiaries 

there are no clauses in either the agreement for apache’s 2018 credit facility or for altus midstream lp’s 2018 credit facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes these agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings however each agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches and if a borrower or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold is insolvent or has any unpaid nonappealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments under the applicable agreement if apache or altus midstream lp as applicable undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold each of apache and altus midstream lp was in compliance with the terms of its 2018 credit facility as of december 31 2020 

there is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future credit facilities will make loans or other extensions of credit available to apache or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders 

there is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to apache or altus midstream lp will not deteriorate we closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups having large bank groups allows the company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment 

commercial paper program apache’s 35 billion commercial paper program which is subject to market availability facilitates apache borrowing funds for up to 270 days as a result of downgrades in apache’s credit ratings during 2020 the company does not expect that its commercial paper program will be cost competitive with its other financing alternatives and does not anticipate using it under such circumstances as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the company had no commercial paper outstanding 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 for additional information regarding these obligations refer to note 9—debt and financing costs and note 11—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

1 includes outstanding principal amounts at december 31 2020 this table does not include future commitment fees interest expense or other fees on the company’s credit facilities because they are floating rate instruments and management cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances repayments or future interest rates to be charged 

2 amounts represent the company’s finance lease obligation related to the company’s midland texas regional office building 

3 amounts represent future lease payments associated with oil and gas operations inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners such payments may be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties and subsequently depreciated impaired or written off as exploration expense 

4 amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms these include minimum commitments associated with takeorpay contracts ngl processing agreements drilling work program commitments and agreements to secure capacity rights on thirdparty pipelines amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable total costs incurred under takeorpay and throughput obligations were 120 million 111 million and 132 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

5 this table does not include the company’s liability for dismantlement abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations for additional information regarding these liabilities please see notes 8 — asset retirement obligation and note 12 — retirement and deferred compensation plans  respectively in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation apache’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations including approximately 2 million for environmental remediation and approximately 70 million for various contingent legal liabilities for a detailed discussion of the company’s lease obligations purchase obligations environmental and legal contingencies and other commitments please see note 11—commitments and contingencies and note 12 — ret irement and deferred com pens ation plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

as further described above under “capital and operational outlook” altus midstream lp andor its subsidiaries have exercised four of the five pipeline options to acquire equity interests in the equity method interest pipelines the fifth pipeline option to acquire an equity interest in a separate intrabasin ngl pipeline was not exercised and expired on march 2 2020 following the exercise of each pipeline option altus midstream lp andor its subsidiaries may be required to fund future capital expenditures for its equity interest share in the development of the applicable pipeline the company estimates that altus based on its equity interests in each pipeline will incur approximately 30 million of additional capital contributions for its equity interests during 2021 

with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico the bureau of ocean energy management boem issued a notice to lessees ntl no 2016n01 significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with wells platforms structures and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases while the ntl was paused in mid2017 and is currently listed on boem’s website as “rescinded” if reinstated the ntl will likely require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging abandonment and decommissioning obligations relating to apache’s current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases the company is working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security if such security becomes necessary under the ntl additionally the company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern 

potential asset retirement obligations 

the company has potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties apache has divested various leases wells and facilities located in the gulf of mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug abandon and decommission the associated wells structures and facilities acquired one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern if a purchaser of our gulf of mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations in such event apache may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise 

in 2013 the company sold its gulf of mexico shelf operations and properties transferred assets to fieldwood energy llc fieldwood under the terms of the purchase agreement the company received cash consideration of 375 billion and fieldwood assumed 15 billion of discounted asset abandonment liabilities as of the disposition date in respect of such abandonment liabilities fieldwood posted letters of credit in favor of the company letters of credit and established a trust account trust a which is funded by a 10 percent net profits interest depending on future oil prices and of which the company is the beneficiary on february 14 2018 fieldwood filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in connection with the 2018 bankruptcy fieldwood confirmed a plan under which the company agreed inter alia to accept bonds in exchange for certain of the letters of credit currently the company holds two bonds bonds and the remaining letters of credit to secure fieldwood’s asset retirement obligations aros on the transferred assets as and when such abandonment and decommissioning obligations are required to be performed over the remaining life of the transferred assets 

on august 3 2020 fieldwood again filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code fieldwood has submitted a plan of reorganization and the company has been engaged in discussions with fieldwood and other interested parties regarding such plan if approved by the bankruptcy court the submitted plan would separate the transferred assets into a standalone company and proceeds of production of the transferred assets will be used for the aros if the proceeds of production are insufficient for such aros then apache expects that it may be required by the relevant governmental authorities to perform such aros in which case it will apply the bonds remaining letters of credit and trust a to pay for the aros in addition after such sources have been exhausted apache has agreed to provide a standby loan of up to 400 million for the new company to perform decommissioning with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the transferred assets if the foregoing is insufficient the company may be forced to use available cash to cover any additional costs it incurs for performing such aros 

insurance program 

apache maintains insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to its assets general liabilities workers’ compensation employers’ liability sudden and accidental pollution and other risks the company’s insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that it must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance additionally the company’s insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations there is no assurance that insurance will adequately protect apache against liability from all potential consequences and damages further the company does not have coverage in place for a variety of other risks including gulf of mexico named windstorm and business interruption 

current insurance policies covering physical damage to the company’s assets provide up to 1 billion in coverage per occurrence these policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage the company’s current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide 500 million in coverage scaled to apache’s interest service agreements including drilling contracts generally indemnify apache for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider 

apache purchases multiyear political risk insurance from us international development finance corporation dfc successor to overseas private investment corporation opic and highlyrated insurers covering a portion of its investments in egypt for losses arising from confiscation nationalization and expropriation risks the islamic corporation for the insurance of investment and export credit iciec an agency of the islamic development bank reinsures dfc in the aggregate these insurance policies provide up to 750 million of coverage subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately 500 million 

apache has an additional insurance policy with dfc which subject to policy terms and conditions provides up to 300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from 1 nonpayment by egpc of arbitral awards covering amounts owed apache on past due invoices and 2 expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of egypt prevent apache from exporting our share of production the multilateral investment guarantee agency miga a member of the world bank group provides 150 million in reinsurance to dfc 

future insurance coverage for the company’s industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable or unavailable on terms economically acceptable 

critical accounting estimates 

apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes apache identifies certain accounting policies involving estimation as critical based on among other things their impact on the portrayal of apache’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty subjectivity and complexity in their deployment critical accounting estimates cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown management routinely discusses the development selection and disclosure of each of the company’s critical accounting estimates the following is a discussion of apache’s most critical accounting estimates 

reserves estimates 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas crude oil condensate and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions operating conditions and government regulations 

proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless specific circumstances justify a longer time 

despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates the company’s reserves are used throughout its financial statements for example since the company uses the unitsofproduction method to amortize its oil and gas properties the quantity of reserves could significantly impact dda expense a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments finally these reserves are the basis for apache’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures for more information regarding apache’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures refer to note 1 8 — supplem ental oil and gas disclosures unaudit ed  in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months held flat for the life of the production except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation 

apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing 

oil and gas exploration costs 

apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are also capitalized oil and gas exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized or suspended pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found on a quarterly basis management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations otherwise the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized 

longlived asset impairments 

longlived assets used in operations including proved oil and gas properties and gpt assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets if there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recovered the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices volumes and future development plans are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach 

under the income approach the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs proved reserves the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves expected throughput volumes for gpt assets discount rates and other variables key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date and estimates of operating administrative and capital costs adjusted for inflation the company discounts the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants 

to assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate when available management uses a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets this requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets recent comparable asset transactions and transaction premiums 

although the fair value estimate of each asset group is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ from the estimate negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities increases in future cost estimates divestiture of a significant component of the asset group or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of longlived assets in future periods 

over the past several years the company has experienced substantial volatility in commodity prices which impacted its future development plans and operating cash flows as such material impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering processing and transmission facilities were recorded in 2020 2019 and 2018 for discussion of these impairments see “fair value measurements” of note 1—summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

asset retirement obligation aro 

the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations apache’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the north sea and gulf of mexico estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public relations considerations 

aro associated with retiring tangible longlived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement removal site reclamation and similar activities associated with apache’s oil and gas properties and other longlived assets the company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts inflation factors creditadjusted discount rates timing of settlement and changes in the legal regulatory environmental and political environments accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value 

income taxes 

the company’s oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements and tax returns management routinely assesses the ability to realize the company’s deferred tax assets if management concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 

the company regularly assesses and if required establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates the company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position these accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits case law and any new legislation the company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk the term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses the forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 

commodity price risk 

the company’s revenues earnings cash flow capital investments and ultimately future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices the company receives for its crude oil natural gas and ngls which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction weather political climate and global supply and demand these factors have only been heightened as the result of continuing negative demand implications of the covid19 pandemic the company continually monitors its market risk exposure including the impact and developments related to the covid19 pandemic which introduced significant volatility in the financial markets subsequent to the year ended december 31 2019 

the company’s average crude oil realizations decreased 34 percent to 3960 per barrel in 2020 from 6005 per barrel in 2019 the company’s average natural gas price realizations decreased 4 percent to 183 per mcf in 2020 from 190 per mcf in 2019 the company’s average ngl realizations decreased 25 percent to 1184 per barrel in 2020 from 1574 per barrel in 2019 based on average daily production for 2020 a 100 per barrel change in the weighted average realized oil price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately 78 million a 010 per mcf change in the weighted average realized price of natural gas would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately 33 million and a 100 per barrel change in the weighted average realized ngl price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately 28 million 

apache periodically enters into derivative positions on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices such derivative positions may include the use of futures contracts swaps andor options apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes as of december 31 2020 the company had open natural gas derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges in an asset position with a fair value of 11 million the impact of a 10 percent movement in natural gas prices would be immaterial to the fair value of the commodity derivatives these fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at december 31 2020 see note 4—derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report form 10k for notional volumes and terms with the company’s derivative contracts 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2020 apache had approximately 81 billion net carrying value of notes and debentures outstanding all of which was fixedrate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 498 percent although nearterm changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of apache’s fixedrate debt they do not expose the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss associated with that debt apache is also exposed to interest rate risk related to its interestbearing cash and cash equivalents balances and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program and credit facilities as of december 31 2020 the company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately 262 million approximately 46 percent of which was invested in money market funds and shortterm investments with major financial institutions as of december 31 2020 the company had credit facility borrowings of 150 million and 624 million under its apache and altus credit facilities respectively a change in the interest rate applicable to the company’s shortterm investments and credit facility borrowings would have an immaterial impact on earnings and cash flows but could impact interest costs associated with future debt issuances or any future borrowings under its commercial paper program revolving credit facilities and money market lines of credit 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company’s cash activities relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies the company’s north sea production is sold under us dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred are paid in british pounds in egypt substantially all oil and gas production is sold under us dollar contracts and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in us dollars transactions denominated in british pounds are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period 

foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month currency gains and losses are included as either a component of “other” under “revenues and other” or as is the case when the company remeasures its foreign tax liabilities as a component of the company’s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations a foreign currency net gain or loss of 5 million would result from a 10 percent weakening or strengthening respectively in the british pound as of december 31 2020 

the company is subject to increased foreign currency risk associated with the effects of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union apache has periodically entered into foreign exchange contracts in order to minimize the impact of fluctuating exchange rates for the british pound on the company’s operating expenses the company had no outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts as of december 31 2020
