commercial operations 

following i the spinoff and combination of the upjohn business which was our global primarily offpatent branded and generics business with mylan in 2020 which created a new global pharmaceutical company viatris and ii the formation of the consumer healthcare jv with gsk in 2019 we saw the culmination of pfizer’s transformation into a more focused global leader in sciencebased innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 we operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery development manufacturing marketing sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter 2021 we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments each led by a single manager biopharma our innovative sciencebased biopharmaceutical business and pc1 our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients 

our biopharma business includes the following therapeutic areas and key products

collaboration and copromotion 

we use collaboration andor copromotion arrangements to enhance our development rd sales and distribution of certain biopharmaceutical products which include among others the following 

• comirnatybnt162b2 is an mrnabased coronavirus vaccine to help prevent covid19 which is being jointly developed and commercialized with biontech pfizer and biontech equally share the costs of development for the comirnaty program comirnatybnt162b2 has been granted an approval or an authorization in many countries around the world in populations varying by country we also share gross profits equally from commercialization of comirnatybnt162b2 and are working jointly with biontech in our respective territories to commercialize the vaccine worldwide excluding china hong kong macau and taiwan subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals market by market for discussion on comirnatybnt162b2 see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—covid19 pandemic section within mda 

• eliquis apixaban is part of the novel oral anticoagulant market and was jointly developed and commercialized with bms as an alternative treatment option to warfarin in appropriate patients we fund between 50 and 60 of all development costs depending on the study and profits and losses are shared equally except in certain countries where we commercialize eliquis and pay a percentage of net sales to bms in certain smaller markets we have full commercialization rights and bms supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to endcustomers 

• xtandi enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with astellas we share equally in the gross profits and losses related to us net sales and also share equally all xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the us market subject to certain exceptions in addition we share certain development and other collaboration expenses for international net sales we receive royalties based on a tiered percentage 

• bavencio avelumab is a human antiprogrammed death ligand1 pdl1 antibody that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with merck kgaa we jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs and split profits equally related to net sales generated from any products containing avelumab 

• orgovyx relugolix is an oral gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer that is being developed and commercialized with myovant the companies are also collaborating on myfembree relugolix 40 



mg estradiol 10 mg and norethindrone acetate 05 mg for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women and the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis the companies will equally share profits and allowable expenses in the us and canada for orgovyx and myfembree with myovant bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a maximum of 50 million in 2022 myovant will remain responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continue to lead clinical development for the relugolix combination tablet

research and development 

rd is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients the discovery and development of drugs vaccines and biological products are time consuming costly and unpredictable in addition to discovering and developing new products our rd efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications 

our rd priorities and strategy our rd priorities include 

• delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need 

• advancing our capabilities that can position us for longterm rd leadership and 

• advancing new models for partnerships with creativity flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible 

to that end our rd primarily focuses on our main therapeutic areas 

while a significant portion of our rd is internal we also seek promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines we do so by entering into collaboration alliance and license agreements with universities biotechnology companies and other firms as well as through acquisitions and investments these collaboration alliance and license agreements and investments allow us to share knowledge risk and cost they also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and inlicensed or acquired products for information on certain of these collaborations alliances and license arrangements and investments see note 2  

our rd operations in 2021 we continued to strengthen our global rd operations and pursue strategies to improve rd productivity to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time  our rd activity is conducted through various platform functions that operate in parallel within our global operations including the following 

• wrdm research units within wrdm are generally responsible for research and earlystage development assets for our business assets that have not yet achieved proofofconcept and are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility cohesiveness and focus we can rapidly redeploy resources within a research unit and between various projects to leverage as necessary common skills expertise or focus 

• gpd our gpd organization is a unified center for clinical development and regulatory activities that is generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational execution of clinical trials for latestage clinical assets in pfizer’s pipeline 

• sciencebased platformservices organizations within wrdm these organizations provide technical expertise and other services to various rd projects and are organized into sciencebased functions these organizations allow us to react more quickly and effectively to evolving needs by sharing resources among projects candidates and targets across therapeutic areas and phases of development examples of these platform organizations include pharmaceutical sciences and medicine design and worldwide medical and safety 

we manage rd operations on a totalcompany basis through our platform functions described above specifically the portfolio strategy  investment committee composed of senior executives is accountable for aligning resources among all of our wrdm gpd and rd projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative rd portfolio we believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility 

we do not disaggregate total rd expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since as described above we do not manage our rd operations by development phase or by therapeutic area further as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly we believe that any priorperiod information about rd expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending 

for additional information see the costs and expenses — research and development rd expenses section within mda and note 17  



our rd pipeline the process of drug and biological product discovery from initiation through development and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take more than ten years as of february 8 2022 we had the following number of projects in various stages of rd 

development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs while our drug candidates may or may not receive regulatory approval new candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the product developments section within mda for information on the risks associated with rd see the item 1a risk factors—research and development section of this form 10k 

international operations 

our operations are conducted globally and we sell our products in over 125 countries emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastestgrowing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets provide potential growth opportunities for our products 

revenues from operations outside the us of 515 billion accounted for 63 of our total revenues in 2021 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 21 8 and 10 countries outside the us in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively with the increase in the number of countries in 2021 primarily driven by comirnatybnt162b2 by total revenues japan was our largest national market outside the us in 2021 for a geographic breakdown of revenues see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues by geography section within mda and the table captioned geographic information in note 17b  

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — global operations and item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints sections in this form 10k 

sales and marketing 

our prescription biopharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies in the us we primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government cdc wholesalers individual provider offices retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems outside the us we primarily sell our vaccines to government and nongovernment institutions certain of these government contracts may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of a government entity in addition our contracts with government and supranational organizations for the sales of comirnatybnt162b2 and paxlovid which are on a committed basis represented a significant amount of revenues in 2021 we also seek to gain access for our products on formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of healthcare programs or pbms pbms use various benefit designs such as tiered copays for formulary products to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions we may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and physicians on key disease areas for information on our significant customers see note 17c  

we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers and patients mcos that provide insurance coverage such as hospitals integrated delivery systems pbms and health plans and employers and government agencies who hire mcos to provide health benefits to their employees in the us we market directly to consumers through directtoconsumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 



patents and other intellectual property rights 

patents  we own or license a number of patents covering pharmaceutical and other products their uses formulations and product manufacturing processes 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the scope of protection afforded by a patent can vary from country to country and depends on the patent type the scope of its patent claims and the availability of legal remedies patent term extensions pte may be available in some countries to compensate for a loss of patent term due to delay in a product’s approval due to the regulatory requirements one of the primary considerations in limiting our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products although international and us free trade agreements have included some improved global protection of intellectual property rights for additional information see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k 

in various markets a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided for drugs or vaccines upon approval the scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but in general the period will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval 

based on current sales and considering the competition with products sold by our competitors the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic product patent expires are as follows 



1 unless otherwise indicated the years pertain to the basic product patent expiration including granted ptes supplementary protection certificates spc or pediatric exclusivity periods spcs are included when granted in three out of five major european markets france germany italy spain and the uk noted in parentheses is the projected year of expiry of the earliest pending patent term extension in the us or japan andor spc application in europe the term of which if granted may be shorter than originally requested due to a number of factors in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products which may or may not protect our product from generic or biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

2 the basic product patent for chantix expired in the us in november 2020 and in europe in september 2021 

3 the basic product patent for sutent expired in the us in august 2021 and in europe in january 2022 

4 expiry is provided by regulatory exclusivity in this market 

5 the europe patent that covers the combination of the 13 serotype conjugates of prevenar 13 was revoked following an opposition and has now been withdrawn there are other europe patents and pending applications covering the formulation various aspects of the manufacturing process and the combination of serotype conjugates of prevenar 13 that remain in force 

6 eliquis was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with bms for eliquis in the us two patents listed in the fda orange book the composition of matter patent claiming apixaban specifically and a formulation patent were challenged by numerous generic companies and were the subject of patent infringement litigation prior to the resolution of the litigation in our favor on both challenged patents we and bms settled with a number of these generic companies settled generic companies while continuing to litigate against three remaining generic companies remaining generic companies as a result of the litigation the remaining generic companies are not permitted to launch their products until the 2031 expiration date of the formulation patent under the terms of the settlement agreements the permitted date of launch for the settled generic companies under these patents is april 1 2028 

both patents may be subject to subsequent challenges while we cannot predict the outcome of any potential future litigation these are the alternatives that might occur a if both patents are upheld in future litigation through appeal the permitted date of launch for the settled generic companies under these patents would remain april 1 2028 b if the formulation patent is held invalid or not infringed in future litigation through appeal the settled generic companies and any successful future litigant would be permitted to launch on november 21 2026 or c if both patents are held invalid or not infringed in future litigation through appeal the settled generic companies and any successful future litigant could launch products immediately upon such an adverse decision

7 xtandi is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with astellas which has exclusive commercialization rights for xtandi outside the us pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international xtandi net sales 

8 vyndaqel tafamidis meglumine basic patent expiry in japan is august 2026 for treatment of polyneuropathy vynmac tafamidis was approved in japan for treatment of cardiomyopathy with regulatory exclusivity expiring march 2029 

9 we have exclusive rights to braftovi and mektovi in the us the pierre fabre group has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in europe and ono pharmaceutical co ltd has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in japan we receive royalties from the pierre fabre group and ono pharmaceutical co ltd on sales of braftovi and mektovi outside the us 

10 mektovi us expiry is provided by a method of use patent 

11 bavencio is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with merck kgaa 

12 product not yet approved or authorized in this market 

13 an spc has been filed for cibinqo in the uk with expected expiry in 2036 based on the september 2021 approval cibinqo was approved in other major european markets in december 2021 

14 the basic product patent application for comirnaty has been filed in these markets if granted a full term is expected in these markets comirnaty is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with biontech  

15 pfizer does not have copromotion rights for comirnaty in germany 

16 the basic product patent application for paxlovid has been filed in these markets if granted a full term is expected in these markets 

loss of intellectual property rights the loss expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of copromotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues once patent protection has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge we typically lose exclusivity on these products and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similar products and sell them for a lower price the date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however when generic or biosimilar competition does commence the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products often in a very short period of time also if one of our productrelated patents is found to be invalid by judicial court or regulatory or administrative proceedings generic or biosimilar products could be introduced resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products 

we continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — competitive products — intellectual property protection and — thirdparty intellectual property claims sections in this form 10k and note 16a1  

certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years for additional information on the impact of loes on our revenues see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income––revenues––selected product discussion section within mda 

trademarks  our products are sold under brandname and logo trademarks and trade dress registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms and protection is provided in some countries for as long as the mark is used while in others for as long as it is registered protecting our trademarks is of material importance to pfizer 

competition 

our business is conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost though the means of competition vary among our products demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success 

we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat or prevent diseases or indications similar to those treated or prevented by our major products these competitors include other worldwide researchbased biopharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and biosimilar manufacturers our competitors also may devote substantial funds and resources to rd and their successful rd could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence in addition several of our competitors operate without large rd expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration 

to address competitive trends we continually emphasize innovation which is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in rd as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research continues even after drug or vaccine approval as we seek to further demonstrate the value of our products for the conditions they treat or prevent as well as potential new applications we educate patients physicians payers and global health authorities on the benefits and risks of our medicines and vaccines and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical functions including to accurately and ethically launch and market our products to our customers 

operating conditions have also shifted as a result of increased global competitive pressures industry regulation and cost containment we continue to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices in an effort to better meet customer and public needs we believe that we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through our support for better healthcare solutions 

our vaccines may face competition including from the introduction of alternative vaccines or “nextgeneration” vaccines prior to or after the expiration of their patents which may adversely affect our future results 

our biosimilars which include biosimilars of certain inflammation  immunology and oncology biologic medicines compete with branded products from competitors as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “firstto 



market” or early market position for our biosimilars to provide customers a lowercost alternative immediately when available and also to potentially provide us with higher levels of sales and profitability until other competitors enter the market 

generic products  generic pharmaceutical manufacturers pose one of the biggest competitive challenges to our branded small molecule products because they can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less several competitors regularly challenge our product patents before their expiration generic competitors often operate without large rd expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product in china for example we expect to continue to face intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2022 and beyond which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products in addition generic versions of competitors’ branded products may also compete with our products 

mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us and us laws generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for brandname drugs in a small subset of states prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution 

biosimilars certain of our biologic products including enbrel we market enbrel outside the us and canada already face or may face in the future competition from biosimilars also referred to as followon biologics biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety purity or potency biosimilars have the potential to offer highquality lowercost alternatives to innovative biologic medicines in the us biosimilars referencing innovative biologic products are approved under the us public health service act 

pricing pressures and managed care organizations 

commercial pricing pressures pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continue to be significant overall there is increasing pressure on us providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes many employers have adopted high deductible health plans which can increase outofpocket costs for medicines this trend is likely to continue private thirdparty payers such as health plans increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing which could result in lower prices lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products pricing pressures also may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets healthcare provider purchasers directly or through group purchasing organizations are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes 

longer term we foresee a shift in focus away from feeforservice payments towards outcomesbased payments and risksharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes these new payment models can at times lead to lower prices for and restricted access to new medicines at the same time these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions 

in light of the covid19 pandemic and related largescale healthcare disruptions we expect valuebased payment models may have reduced participation if the incentives to participate are reduced or eliminated financially weakened hospitals may weigh their ability to take on the financial risk of downside models in contrast providers in more advanced valuebased models such as full capitation a fixed amount paid in advance per patient per unit of timeperiod generally found their revenues remained steady during the pandemic which may ultimately encourage the growth of such models 

we believe medicines and vaccines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes lower costs to the healthcare system and help ensure access to medicines and vaccines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system this includes assessing our goto market model to address patient affordability challenges we have engaged with major payors and the us government to explore opportunities to improve access and reimbursement in an effort to drive propatient policies in addition in response to the evolving us and global healthcare spending landscape we work with health authorities health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major us payers throughout the productdevelopment process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products further we are developing stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines and vaccines that we discover or develop register and manufacture by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and vaccines and competitor medicines and vaccines along with patterns of healthcare costs 

for information on government pricing pressures see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints and item 1a risk factors — pricing and reimbursement sections in this form 10k 

managed care organizations the evolution of managed care in the us has been a major factor in the competitiveness of the healthcare marketplace approximately 302 million people in the us now have some form of health insurance coverage and the marketing of prescription drugs and vaccines to both consumers and the entities that manage coverage in the us continues to grow in importance in particular the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos at the same time consolidation in the mco industry has resulted in fewer even larger mcos which enhances those mcos’ ability to negotiate pricing and increases their importance to our business since mcos seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures their growing influence has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues 

mcos typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to mco members clinical protocols which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine volume purchasing longterm contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs in addition by placing branded medicines on highertier or nonpreferred status in their formularies mcos transfer a portion of the cost to the patient resulting in significant patient outofpocket expenses this financial disincentive is a tool for mcos to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the mcos the aca has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs which creates 



pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes we are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them 

the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as ways to manage costs hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed and drugs that can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or surgery may become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population and beyond consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products typically on the basis of unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects as well as the overall cost of the therapy we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies however increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a nonpreferred status for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — managed care trends section in this form 10k 

raw materials 

we procure raw materials essential to our business from numerous suppliers worldwide in general these materials have been available in sufficient quantities to support our demand and in many cases are available from multiple suppliers no significant impact to our operations due to the availability of raw materials is currently anticipated in 2022 however we are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials with the potential to constrain available supply which could have a future impact on our business we are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible 

government regulation and price constraints 

we are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which we do business this includes laws and regulations governing the operations of biopharmaceutical companies such as the approval manufacturing and marketing of products pricing including discounts and rebates and health information privacy among others these laws and regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation and a failure to comply could subject us to legal andor administrative actions enforcement measures may include substantial fines andor penalties orders to stop noncompliant activities criminal charges warning letters product recalls or seizures delays in product approvals exclusion from participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions and could result in harm to our reputation and business for additional information see note 16a compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance while capital expenditures or operating costs for compliance with government regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

in the united states 

drug and biologic regulation  the fda pursuant to the ffdca the public health service act and other federal statutes and regulations extensively regulates pre and postmarketing activities related to our biopharmaceutical products the regulations govern areas such as the safety and efficacy of medicines and vaccines clinical trials advertising and promotion quality control manufacturing labeling distribution postmarketing safety surveillance and reporting and record keeping other us federal agencies including the dea also regulate certain of our products and activities 

for a biopharmaceutical company to market a drug or a biologic product including vaccines in the us the fda must evaluate whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use if the fda determines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective the fda will approve the product’s nda or bla or supplemental nda or supplemental bla as appropriate 

a drug or biologic may be subject to postmarketing commitments which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct or postmarketing requirements which are studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval in addition we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cgmps the fda regulations that govern all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals and the drug supply chain security act the law that among other things sets forth requirements related to product tracing product identifiers and verification for manufacturers wholesale distributors repackagers and dispensers to facilitate the tracing of product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain as well as advertising and promotion regulations for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — development regulatory approval and marketing of products and — postauthorizationapproval data sections in this form 10k 

in the context of public health emergencies like the covid19 pandemic we may apply to the fda for an eua which if granted allows for the distribution and use of our products during the declared emergency in accordance with the conditions set forth in the eua unless the eua is otherwise terminated by the government although the criteria for an eua differ from the criteria for approval of an nda or bla euas nevertheless require the development and submission of data to satisfy the relevant fda standards and a number of ongoing obligations the fda generally expects eua holders to work toward submission of full applications such as a bla or an nda as soon as possible 

biosimilar regulation the fda is responsible for approval of biosimilars innovator biologics are entitled to 12 years of market exclusivity by statute and biosimilars applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic 

sales and marketing regulations  our marketing practices are subject to state laws as well as federal laws such as the antikickback statute and false claims act intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry the antikickback statute generally prohibits corruptly soliciting offering receiving or paying anything of value to generate business the false claims act generally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented any claims for payment for goods or services including to government payers such as medicare and medicaid that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent the federal government and states also regulate sales and marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers requiring disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions and the adoption of compliance standards or programs state 



attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

pricing reimbursement and access regulations pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded or more directly impose controls on drug pricing government reimbursement and access to medicines and vaccines on public and private insurance plans could have a material impact on us 

in addition in order to have our products covered by medicaid we must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state programs we also must report specific prices to government agencies the calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose us to enforcement measures see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues by geography section within mda and note 1h 

government and private payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products and there is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products including proposed actions to facilitate drug importation limit reimbursement to lower international reference prices require deep discounts and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and sometimes a written justification for the increase could adversely affect our business if implemented we expect to see continued focus by congress and the biden administration on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs for example there is proposed legislation that if enacted would allow medicare to negotiate prices for certain prescription drugs as well as require that penalties be paid by manufacturers who raise drug prices faster than inflation in addition changes to the medicaid program or the federal 340b drug pricing program which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities could have a material impact on our business for example certain changes issued in a final rule by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms in december 2020 to the medicaid drug rebate program could increase our medicaid rebate obligations and increase the discounts we extend to 340b covered entities additional changes to the 340b program are undergoing review and their status is unclear for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — pricing and reimbursement section in this form 10k 

a majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under medicaid including some of our products for example access to our products under the medicaid managed care programs typically is determined by the health plans with which state medicaid agencies contract to provide services to beneficiaries states seek to control healthcare costs related to medicaid and other state healthcare programs including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under the medicaid drug rebate program tied to patient outcomes states’ budgets were impacted less by the covid19 pandemic than expected and are generally growing we expect states to seek cost cutting within medicaid which may focus on managed care capitation payments andor formulary management states may also advance drugpricing initiatives with a focus on affordability review boards financial penalties related to pricing practices manufacturer pricing and reporting requirements as well as regulation of prescription drug assistance or copay accumulator programs in the commercial market payers may promote generic drugs and biosimilars more aggressively to generate savings and attempt to stimulate additional price competition in addition we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains wholesalers and pbms will increase pricing pressures in the industry for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — managed care trends section in this form 10k 

anticorruption the fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations 

data privacy the collection and use of personal data by us is increasingly important to our business and is subject to various federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies such laws and regulations continue to evolve and are increasingly being enforced vigorously 

outside the united states 

new drug approvals in the eu the ema conducts the scientific evaluation supervision and safety monitoring of our innovative medicinal products and employs a centralized procedure for approval for the eu and the european economic area eea countries in the uk the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency is the sole regulatory authority in japan the pmda is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities including clinical studies approvals postmarketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety in china the nmpa is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines health authorities in many middle and lowerincome countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority eg the fda or ema before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval 

pharmacovigilance in the eu the ema’s prac is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues outside developed markets pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive but there is a trend toward increasing regulation 

pricing and reimbursement  certain governments including in the different eu member states the uk japan china canada and south korea provide healthcare at lowtozero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global financing pressures governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs including proposing price reform or legislation cross country collaboration and procurement price cuts mandatory rebates health technology assessments forced localization as a condition of market access “international reference pricing” ie the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries qce processes and vbp in addition the international patchwork of price regulation differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries several important multilateral organizations such as the who are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through policy recommendations and sponsorship of programs such as “the oslo medicines initiative” which is planning a highlevel meeting in 2022 to agree on who europe member states’ commitments to ensure “affordability for highpriced medicines” in november 2020 the ec published its new pharmaceutical strategy for europe which envisions a broad range of new initiatives and legislation including a significant focus on affordability and access to medicines 



in china pricing pressures have increased in recent years because of an overall focus on healthcare cost containment with government officials emphasizing improved health outcomes healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards reform for patented products drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of adding innovative drugs including oncology medicines to the national reimbursement drug list nrdl in the offpatent space numerous local generics have been officially deemed bioequivalent under a qce process that required domesticallymanufactured generic drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug typically the originator drug a centralized vbp program a tender process where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners and is intended to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed qce has resulted in dramatic price cuts for offpatent medicines furthermore the chinese government has discussed moving toward efforts to unify the reimbursement price between qceapproved generic medicines and the applicable original medicines which the government currently plans to implement within the next few years we and most offpatent originators have mostly not been successful in the vbp bidding process the government has indicated that additional postloe drugs could be subjected to vbp qualification in future rounds while certain details of future qce expansion have been made available we are unable to determine the impact on our business and financial condition until the initiation of these future rounds 

healthcare provider transparency and disclosures several countries have implemented laws requiring or industry trade associations have recommended disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers andor healthcare organizations such as academic teaching hospitals 

intellectual property  reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and rd investment the wto agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights wtotrips requires participant countries to provide patent and other intellectual propertyrelated protection for pharmaceutical products by law with an exemption provided for leastdeveloped countries until 2033 while some countries have made improvements we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries 

while the global intellectual property policy environment has generally improved following wtotrips and bilateralmultilateral trade agreements our growth and ability to bring new product innovation to patients depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in certain developed international markets governments maintain relatively effective intellectual property policies however in the eu pursuant to the ongoing review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives legislative change may result in the reduction of certain protections in several emerging market countries governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals discussions are ongoing at the wto that seek to limit intellectual property protections within the context of the covid19 pandemic response 

considerable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions revocation of patents laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection 

our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries and helping improve patients’ access to innovative medicines and vaccines 

data privacy outside of the us many countries have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data including but not limited to the eu’s general data protection regulations and china’s personal information protection law the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is also rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt new and updated privacy and data security laws the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations remain uncertain and continue to evolve in addition enforcement of such laws and regulations is increasing 

environmental matters 

our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2021 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 55 million in environmentrelated capital expenditures and 152 million in other environmentrelated expenses 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position see also note 16a3  

climate change presents risks to our operations including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers we cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities or supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we periodically review our vulnerability to potential weatherrelated risks and other natural disasters and update our assessments accordingly based on our reviews we do not believe these potential risks are material to our operations at this time 

human capital 

our purpose is breakthroughs that change patients’ lives  these breakthroughs are delivered through the relentless collaboration of our talented workforce as of december 31 2021 we employed approximately 79000 people worldwide with approximately 29000 based in the us women compose approximately 49 of our global workforce and approximately 34 of our usbased employees are individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds 

our continued success links directly to the commitment engagement and performance of our employees it is important that we not only attract and retain the best and brightest diverse talent but also ensure they remain engaged and can thrive in an environment that is committed to helping them grow succeed and contribute directly to achieving our purpose as part of these efforts we strive for an inclusive and empowering work environment adopting practices to simplify processes and remove needless complexity rewarding both performance and leadership skills 



fostering career growth and internal mobility and offering competitive compensation and benefits programs that encourage mental and physical well being 

core values to fully realize pfizer’s purpose we have established a clear set of goals regarding what we need to achieve for patients and how we will go about achieving them the “how” is represented by four simple powerful company values – courage  excellence  equity and joy  each value defines our company and our culture 

• courage  breakthroughs start by challenging convention – especially in the face of uncertainty or adversity this happens when we think big speak up and are decisive 

• excellence  we can only change patients’ lives when we perform at our best together this happens when we focus on what matters agree who does what and measure outcomes 

• equity  every person deserves to be seen heard and cared for this happens when we are inclusive act with integrity and reduce health care disparities 

• joy  we give ourselves to our work and it also gives to us we find joy when we take pride recognize one another and have fun 

diversity equity and inclusion at pfizer every person deserves to be seen heard and cared for and we work to further this goal by bringing together people with different backgrounds perspectives and experiences our commitments to equity consist of specific actions to help foster a more inclusive environment within pfizer including among others i building a more inclusive colleague experience through representation and meaningful connections ii advancing equitable health outcomes by evaluating our work through the lens of the communities we serve iii providing resources on allyship and the science behind inclusion to support all colleagues in having courageous conversations about equity race and the avoidance of bias iv working to help transform society with external diversity equity and inclusion partnerships including deploying capital engaging diverse suppliers and amplifying equity initiatives and v working to help ensure demographics of clinical trials correlate to those of the countries where trials are taking place 

colleague engagement  to attract develop and inspire the brightest talent we aim to support our colleagues by engaging and partnering with them to help ensure they feel they are part of a community we understand the importance of continuously listening and responding to colleague feedback and our annual engagement survey pfizer pulse provides a forum for our colleagues to give structured feedback about their colleague experience through this survey we measure and track key areas of the overall colleague experience and equip leaders with actionable insights for discussion and follow up regular topics in the survey include i employee engagement such as colleagues’ commitment to and advocacy for pfizer ii purpose including how colleagues’ work connects with our purpose iii inclusion such as having a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued and iv growth including the ability for colleagues to gain new experiences that align with their individual career goals 

in 2021 we continued to maintain low turnover rates relative to the pharmaceutical industry and in our 2021 pfizer pulse survey on average  90 of colleagues reported feeling engaged as measured by pride in working at pfizer willingness to recommend pfizer as a great place to work and intent to stay in addition 92 of the colleagues agreed that their daily work contributes to our purpose while we are slightly behind in our bold moves goal to create room for meaningful work we continue to make progress on simplifying processes and removing needless complexity we have committed to tangible actions and principles that incorporate the similar behaviors and mindset we used to develop a covid19 vaccine in an accelerated timeline these behaviors include working with urgency and overcoming bureaucracy as well as believing in our purpose trusting in one another and being transparent 

performance leadership and growth we are committed to helping our colleagues reach their full potential by rewarding both their performance and leadership skills and by providing opportunities for growth and development our performance management approach—called performance and leadership insights—is based on sixmonth semesters during which our colleagues and their managers set goals receive feedback and meet to discuss performance these conversations are meant to help colleagues grow and develop by evaluating performance what the colleague achieved measured by outcomes leadership how they achieved it taking into account pfizer’s values of courage excellence equity and joy and identifying areas of growth that help move colleagues towards fulfilling their career goals and their potential our commitments to colleague development consist of specific actions to encourage nonlinear career growth paths for all colleagues including i a common language around growth—along with a guiding framework—to help colleagues identify their next best growth experience ii tools and resources to encourage growth conversations and offer transparency on the sources of growth available and iii a variety of programs including mentoring job rotations experiential project roles skillbased volunteering and learning resources focused on various topics including leadership and management skills and industry and jobspecific learning as well as general business manufacturing finance and technology skills 

health safety and wellbeing  protecting the health safety and wellbeing of colleagues and contingent workers all of whom are essential to delivering our business objectives is an integral part of how we operate our global environment health  safety ehs policy and supporting standards outline our approach to assessment evaluation elimination and mitigation of ehs risks across our operations covid19 pandemic preparedness and response continues to be a key focus to help ensure onsite workers at our commercial manufacturing and research sites remain safe and healthy while continuing to support work from home arrangements for colleagues who can work remotely as part of these efforts we i implemented a vaccination program for colleagues and their families in the us and 23 other countries where employer vaccination programs were possible ii partnered with and launched thrive global a wellness and organizational change initiative with a primary focus on colleague mental health and wellness and iii hosted educational webinars and information sessions on mental health and wellbeing nutrition and work life balance through our employee assistance program provider 

pay equity our commitment to pay equity for all colleagues is based in our value of equity and our intention to continue to build a diverse and inclusive workforce we are committed to equitable pay practices at pfizer for employees based on role education experience performance and location and we conduct and report publicly on pay equity on an annual basis

 item 1a risk factors tableend

this section describes the material risks to our business which should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is 



not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties additionally our business is subject to general risks applicable to any company such as economic conditions geopolitical events extreme weather and natural disasters if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize our business operations financial condition operating results including components of our financial results cash flows prospects reputation or credit ratings could be adversely affected now and in the future potentially in a material way the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements as discussed in the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results section in this form 10k 

risks related to our business industry and operations 

managed care trends 

private payers such as health plans and other managed care entities such as pbms continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs the negotiating power of mcos and other private thirdparty payers has increased due to consolidation and they along with governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement these initiatives have increased consumers’ interest and input in medication choices as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lowercost generic alternatives we may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing 

the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions which typically have smaller patient populations combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products also has generated increased payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector 

thirdparty payers also use additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing and valuebased pricingcontracting to improve their cost containment efforts such payers are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us private thirdparty payer market consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form we may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers as they continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

also business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action as well as evolving judicial interpretations our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such government and industry guidance 

competitive products 

competitive product launches may erode future sales of our products including our existing products and those currently under development or result in unanticipated product obsolescence such launches continue to occur and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products that treat diseases and conditions like those treated by our inline products and product candidates 

in addition competition from manufacturers of generic drugs including from generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity is a major challenge for our branded products certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years for additional information see the item 1 business—patents and other intellectual property rights section in this form 10k in china we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturers which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products 

in addition our patented products may face generic competition before patent exclusivity expires including upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products generic manufacturers have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that they claim do not infringe our patents or claim that our patents are not valid these include candidates that would compete with among other products ibrance and xeljanz our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or copromotion rights 

we may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars 

we also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others including other biosimilar products the entry to the market of competing biosimilars is expected to increase pricing pressures on our biosimilar products uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factors such as anticompetitive practices access challenges where our product may not receive appropriate coveragereimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the innovative product or misaligned financial incentives 

for additional information on competition our products face see the item 1 business — competition section in this form 10k 

concentration 

we recorded direct product andor alliance revenues of more than 1 billion for each of nine products that collectively accounted for 75 of our total revenues in 2021 in particular comirnatybnt162b2 accounted for 45 of our total revenues in 2021 for additional information see notes 1 and 17  if these products or any of our other major products were to experience loss of patent protection if applicable changes in prescription or vaccination growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects or safety concerns regulatory proceedings negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling pricing and access pressures or supply shortages or if a new more effective product should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant in particular certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years and patents covering a number of our bestselling products are or have been the subject of pending legal challenges for additional information on our patents see the item 1 business — patents and other intellectual property rights section in this form 10k for comirnatybnt162b2 and 



paxlovid while we believe that these products have the potential to provide ongoing revenue streams for pfizer for the foreseeable future revenues of these products following the covid19 pandemic may not be at the similar levels as those being generated during the pandemic for information on additional risks associated with comirnatybnt162b2 and paxlovid see the covid19 pandemic section below 

in addition we sell our prescription pharmaceutical products principally through wholesalers in the us for additional information see note 17c  if one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler does with us andor we might be unable to timely collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers including us 

research and development 

the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our business our product lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share as well as to provide for earnings growth primarily through internal rd or through collaborations acquisitions jvs licensing or other arrangements growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers however balancing current growth investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge the costs of product development continue to be high as are regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas which may affect the number of candidates we are able to fund as well as the sustainability of the rd portfolio decisions made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities if the candidate receives regulatory approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges but there is no assurance that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved 

additionally our product candidates can fail at any stage of the rd process and may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of rd we may fail to correctly identify indications for which our science is promising or allocate rd investment resources efficiently and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic areas product classes geographic markets andor licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if we identify areas with the greatest commercial potential the scientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for rd and the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement for example our gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology with only a few gene therapies approved to date which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and the ability to obtain regulatory approval further gene therapy may face difficulties in gaining the acceptance of patients or the medical community 

global operations 

we operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls global economic conditions including inflation expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action including the current conflict between russia and ukraine terrorist activity unstable governments and legal systems intergovernmental disputes public health outbreaks epidemics pandemics natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change 

some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending as a result of these and other factors our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful and growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable 

government financing and economic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices access criteria eg through health technology assessments or other means of cost control for additional information on government pricing pressures see the item 1 business—government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k 

we continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments that could impact our business if trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economic activity potential impacts could include declining sales increased costs volatility in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments required increases of our pension funding obligations increased government cost control efforts delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

we operate in many countries and transact in over 100 different currencies changes in the value of those currencies relative to the us dollar or high inflation in these countries can impact our revenues costs and expenses and our financial guidance significant portions of our revenues costs and expenses as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to exchange rate changes 63 of our total 2021 revenues were derived from international operations including 29 from europe and 19 from china japan and the rest of asia future changes in exchange rates or economic conditions and the impact they may have on our results of operations financial condition or business are difficult to predict for additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk see the analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resources and market risk section within mda 

in addition our borrowing pension benefit and postretirement benefit obligations and interestbearing investments are subject to risk from changes in interest and exchange rates the risks related to interestbearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resources and market risk section within mda and note 7e  for additional details on critical accounting estimates and assumptions for our benefit plans see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions—benefit plans section within mda and note 11  

from time to time we issued variable rate debt based on libor or undertook interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates used to calculate libor after 2021 this deadline was extended until june 2023 for a number of key us dollar benchmark maturities including the 1month and 3month 



libor rates the us federal reserve has selected the secured overnight funding rate sofr as the preferred alternate rate and the transition away from libor will continue despite the extended timeline we are planning for this transition and will amend any contracts to accommodate the sofr rate where required we do not expect the transition to have significant impact on our business or financial condition 

product manufacturing sales and marketing risks 

we could encounter difficulties or delays in our supply chain product manufacturing and distribution networks as well as sales or marketing due to regulatory actions shutdowns work stoppages or strikes approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions shortages or stockouts at our facilities or thirdparty facilities that we rely on reputational harm the impact to our facilities due to health pandemics or natural or manmade disasters including as a result of climate change product liability or unanticipated costs examples of such difficulties or delays include the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand challenges related to component materials to maintain supply andor appropriate quality standards throughout our supply network andor comply with applicable regulations inability to supply certain products due to voluntary product recalls as is the case with chantix and supply chain disruptions at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor in addition we engage contract manufacturers and from time to time our contract manufacturers may face difficulties or are unable to manufacture our products at the necessary quantity or quality levels 

regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities as well as thirdparty facilities that we rely on to evaluate compliance with cgmp or other applicable requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions such as warning letters suspension of manufacturing seizure of product injunctions debarment product recalls delays or denials of product approvals import bans or denials of import certifications 

in july and august 2021 pfizer recalled 16 lots of chantix in the us due to the presence of a nitrosamine nnitrosovarenicline at or above the fda interim acceptable intake limit in september 2021 pfizer expanded its voluntary recall in the us to include all lots of chantix we currently also have a voluntary recall across multiple markets and a global pause in shipments of chantix technical solutions are being pursued to reduce nitrosamine levels in chantix to enable return to market nitrosamines are impurities common in water and foods and everyone is exposed to some level of nitrosamines in response to requests from various regulatory authorities manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry including pfizer are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential for the presence or formation of nitrosamines this may lead to additional recalls or other market actions for pfizer products 

collaborations and other relationships with third parties 

we depend on thirdparty collaborators service providers and others in the research development manufacturing and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into jvs and other business development transactions to achieve expected longerterm benefits we may make substantial upfront payments as part of these transactions which may negatively impact our reported earnings or cash flows we rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development manufacturing and commercialization activities but we do not control many aspects of those activities we also outsource certain services including activities related to transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial recruitment and execution clinical lab services nonclinical research safety services integrated facilities management and other areas failure by one or more of the thirdparty collaborators service providers and others to complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations or to meet their contractual or other obligations to us failure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any disruption in the relationships between us and these parties could delay or prevent the development approval manufacturing or commercialization of our products and product candidates expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues erroneous data and supply disruptions and could also result in noncompliance with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or subject us to reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business further our alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and copromotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time for information on additional risks specific to our consumer healthcare jv see the consumer healthcare jv with gsk section below 

counterfeit products 

our reputation and promising pipeline render our medicines and vaccines prime targets for counterfeiters counterfeit medicines and vaccines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate this threat could adversely impact pfizer’s patients potentially causing them harm this in turn may result in the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines and vaccines and potentially impact our business through lost sales product recalls and possible litigation 

the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including the adoption of ecommerce which increased during the covid19 pandemic greatly enhancing consumers’ ability to obtain prescriptions and other medical treatments via the internet in lieu of traditional brick and mortar pharmacies or authorized fullservice internet pharmacies the internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams because of consumers’ misplaced trust with certain ecommerce retailers coupled with the anonymity the internet affords counterfeiters while counterfeiters generally target any medicine or vaccine boasting strong demand we have observed heightened counterfeit and fraud attempts to our covid19 vaccine as well as other products potentially utilized in the treatment of covid19 

we consistently invest in an enterprisewide strategy to aggressively combat counterfeit threats by educating patients and health care providers about the risks investing in innovative technologies to detect and disrupt sophisticated internet offers and scams proactively monitoring and interdicting supply with the help of law enforcement and advising legislators and regulators however our efforts and those of others may not be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase

us and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls or limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions more restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue we expect pricing pressures will continue globally 

in the us pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and calls for reform and many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures as a result we expect to see continued focus by the federal government on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs some states have implemented and others are considering patient access constraints or cost cutting under the medicaid program and some are considering measures that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible state legislatures also have continued to focus on addressing drug costs generally by increasing price transparency or limiting drug price increases measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products including legislation on drug importation could adversely affect our business for additional information on us pricing and reimbursement see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we operate in certain markets such as in eu member states the uk japan china canada and south korea governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices access criteria or impose other means of cost control particularly as a result of recent global financing pressures for example the qce and vbp tender process in china has resulted in dramatic price cuts for offpatent medicines for additional information regarding these government initiatives see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k we anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures in china and elsewhere in the future in addition in many countries with respect to our vaccines we participate in a tender process for selection in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business we also anticipate pricing pressures will be amplified by covid19 induced budget deficits and focus on pricing for covid19 treatments and vaccines 

us healthcare regulation 

the us healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes any significant efforts at the us federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us for additional information on us healthcare regulation see the item 1 business––government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k 

other us federal or state legislative or regulatory action andor policy efforts could adversely affect our business including among others general budget control actions changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs to the us at prices that are regulated by foreign governments revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government programs that could reference international prices or require new discounts limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals and other industry stakeholders or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 

a reduction of us federal spending on entitlement programs including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

the discovery and development of drugs vaccines and biological products are time consuming costly and unpredictable the outcome is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk due to the following factors among others 

• the process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years 

• product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process including as the result of unfavorable preclinical and clinical trial results or unfavorable new preclinical or clinical data and further analyses of existing preclinical or clinical data including results that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or indication 

• we may need to amend our clinical trial protocols or conduct additional clinical trials under certain circumstances for example to further assess appropriate dosage or collect additional safety data 

• we may not be able to meet anticipated preclinical or clinical endpoints commencement andor completion dates for our preclinical or clinical trials regulatory submission dates regulatory approval dates andor launch dates 

• we may not be able to successfully address all the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the fda and the ema or be able to obtain approval for new products and indications from regulators 

regulatory approvals of our products depend on myriad factors including regulatory determinations as to the product’s safety and efficacy in the context of public health emergencies like the covid19 pandemic regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency or conditional basis additionally clinical trial and other product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities as a result of regulatory interpretations and assessments or other developments that occur during the review process and even after a product is authorized or approved for marketing a product’s commercial potential could be adversely affected by potential emerging concerns or regulatory decisions regarding or impacting labeling or marketing manufacturing processes safety andor other matters including decisions relating to emerging developments regarding potential product impurities 

we may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees such as the acip or any fda advisory committee that may be convened to review our applications such as euas ndas or blas which may impact the potential marketing and use of our products further claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of inline products and product candidates can negatively impact product sales and potentially lead to product recalls or withdrawals including regulatordirected risk evaluations and 



assessments andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims further regulatory agency requirements may result in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for among other things additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements for these and other reasons discussed in this risk factors section we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

postauthorizationapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product the fda may require additional clinical trials or other studies the results generated in these trials could result in the loss of marketing approval changes in labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects efficacy or safety regulatory agencies in countries outside the us often have similar regulations and may impose comparable requirements postmarketing studies and clinical trials whether conducted by us or by others whether mandated by regulatory agencies or conducted voluntarily and other emerging data about products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products further if safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a product in the same class as one of our products those concerns could implicate the entire class and this in turn could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our products as well as other products in the class the potential regulatory and commercial implications of postmarketing study results typically cannot immediately be determined for example in december 2021 in light of the results from the completed required postmarketing safety study of xeljanz oral surveillance a3921133 the us label for xeljanz was revised updates include a new boxed warning for major adverse cardiovascular events mace and updated boxed warnings regarding mortality malignancies and thrombosis with corresponding updates to applicable warnings and precautions in addition indications for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ra or active psa and patients who are two years of age and older with active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis have been revised xeljanz is now indicated in patients who have had inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor blockers in addition at the request of the ec the prac of the ema has adopted a referral procedure under article 20 of regulation ec no 7262004 to assess safety information relating to oral jak inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases including xeljanz and cibinqo which is ongoing we continue to work with regulatory agencies to review the full results and analyses of oral surveillance and their impact on product labeling 

the terms of our eua for comirnaty require that we conduct postauthorization observational studies in patients at least 5 years of age or older who received a booster dose or other populations of interest including healthcare workers pregnant women immunocompromised individuals and subpopulations with specific comorbidities additionally in relation to the fda approval for comirnaty we are required to complete certain postmarketing study requirements and commitments by 2024 as identified in the august 2021 approval letter the terms of our eua for paxlovid require monitoring for convergence of global viral variants of sarscov2 and potential assessment of paxlovid activity against identified global variants of interest additionally in relation to the potential fda approval for paxlovid we are required to complete certain other analyses and studies as identified in the december 2021 authorization letter 

legal matters 

we are and may be involved in various legal proceedings including patent litigation product liability and other productrelated litigation including personal injury consumer offlabel promotion securities antitrust and breach of contract claims commercial and other asserted and unasserted matters environmental government investigations employment tax litigation and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations 

government investigations and actions could result in substantial fines andor criminal charges and civil penalties limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions as well as reputational harm including as a result of increased public interest in the matter in addition in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government 

our sales and marketing activities and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this form 10k as well as the antikickback statute antibribery laws the false claims act and similar laws in international jurisdictions in addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation settlement precedent advisory opinions and special fraud alerts our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of developments requirements or industry standards in the us and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions if an interaction is found to be improper government enforcement actions and penalties could result like many companies in our industry we have from timetotime received and may receive in the future inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities in addition we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries such claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged noncompliance with laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product approved and unapproved information potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational damage this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

in connection with the resolution of a us government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to medicare patients in 2018 we entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services which is effective for a period of five years in the cia we agreed to implement andor maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirements breaches of the cia could result in severe sanctions against us 



we and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to legal claims and proceedings including environmental contingencies amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions while we have accrued for worldwide legal liabilities no guarantee exists that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued 

for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in see note 16a  

risks related to intellectual property technology and security 

intellectual property protection 

our success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all for example in may 2021 the brazilian supreme court voted to invalidate article 40 of brazil’s patent law which guaranteed a minimum 10year patent term from patent grant and to give retroactive effect to such decision in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term made by parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area 

further legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governments could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from enforcing intellectual property related to our products discussions are ongoing at the wto regarding the role of intellectual property in the context of the covid19 pandemic response this includes a proposal that would release wto members from their obligation under wtotrips to grant and enforce various types of intellectual property protection on health products and technology in relation to the prevention containment or treatment of covid19 in may 2021 and again in november 2021 the biden administration called on countries to waive intellectual property protections on covid19 vaccines 

the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinct patent laws and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country its enforcement practices and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country’s intellectual property framework eg laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches that challenge our patent rights most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products uses processes or dosage forms are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of or attempts to enforce patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition andor violations of antitrust laws such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents we are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers payers governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry we also are often involved in other proceedings such as inter partes review postgrant review reexamination or opposition proceedings before the us patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others also if one of our patents or a competitors’ patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings generic or biosimilar products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved see note 16a1  further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our rights we seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a thirdparty from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

thirdparty intellectual property claims 

a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were improperly granted including challenges through negotiation and litigation and such challenges may not always be successful 

part of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities which may involve litigation associated costs and time delays and may ultimately not be successful these opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid or where products do not infringe the patents of others in some circumstances we may take action such as litigation asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a “firsttomarket” or early market position for our products 

third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and timeconsuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launches and may result in significant royalty payments or damages 



for example our rd in a therapeutic area may not be first and another company or entity may have obtained relevant patents before us we are involved in patentrelated disputes with third parties over our attempts to market pharmaceutical products once we have final regulatory approval of the related products we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings including any appeals have not been resolved ie “atrisk” launch if one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments or we may be prevented from further sales of that product such damages may be enhanced as much as threefold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party 

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business we extensively rely upon sophisticated information technology systems including cloud services to operate our business we produce collect process store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including personal information and intellectual property and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of such confidential information we have outsourced significant elements of our operations including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we manage relationships with many thirdparty providers who may or could have access to our confidential information we rely on technology developed supplied andor maintained by thirdparties that may make us vulnerable to “supply chain” style cyberattacks further technology and security vulnerabilities of acquisitions business partners or thirdparty providers may not be identified during due diligence or soon enough to mitigate exploitation the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems and those of our thirdparty providers and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or contingent workers providers or malicious attackers as a global pharmaceutical company our systems and assets are the target of frequent cyberattacks such cyberattacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal groups “hacktivists” nation states and others due to the nature of some of these attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology our efforts may not prevent service interruptions extortion theft of confidential or proprietary information compromise of data integrity or unauthorized information disclosure any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

risks related to business development 

business development activities 

we expect to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through various forms of business development which can include alliances licenses jvs collaborations equity or debtbased investments dispositions divestments mergers and acquisitions the success of these activities is dependent on the availability and accurate costbenefit evaluation of appropriate opportunities competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions including the ability to satisfy closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes or at all and successfully integrate acquisitions pursuing these opportunities may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which could result in increased leverage andor a downgrade of our credit ratings where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities the value of those securities will fluctuate and may depreciate we may not control a company in which we invest and as a result we will have limited ability to determine its management operational decisions and policies further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess the success of any of our acquisitions will depend when applicable on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating these businesses with us we for example may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with certain of these acquisitions or such cost savings within the expected time frame similarly the accretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisitions may not be realized or may be delayed integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business including thirdparty relationships or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies we also may fail to generate the expected revenue growth for the acquired business expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control unsuccessful clinical trials regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates including those acquired in these acquisitions 

spinoff and combination of upjohn with mylan 

we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the spinoff and combination the transactions of the upjohn business with mylan which resulted in the creation of viatris in november 2020 due to many factors including among others strategic adjustments required to reflect the nature of our business following the transactions increased risks resulting from us becoming a company that is a more focused innovative sciencebased biopharmaceutical products business and the possibility that we may not achieve our strategic objectives in addition we have agreed to provide certain transition services to viatris generally for an initial period of 24 months following the completion of the transactions with certain possibilities for extension these obligations under the transition services agreements may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business 

consumer healthcare jv with gsk 

in 2019 we and gsk combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a jv that operates globally under the gsk consumer healthcare name although we have certain consent board representation and other governance rights we are a minority owner of the jv and do not control the jv its management or its policies as a result our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction depend upon gsk’s operation and management of the jv in addition the jv is subject to risks that are different than the risks associated with our business many of these risks are outside gsk’s or the jv’s control and could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the jv 



in june 2021 gsk announced that it intends to demerge at least 80 of its 68 ownership interest in the jv in mid2022 subject to gsk shareholder approval following the demerger the jv is expected to be an independent listed company on the london stock exchange with american depositary receipts to be listed in the us in which pfizer would initially hold a 32 ownership interest and gsk may hold up to a 136 ownership interest notwithstanding gsk’s announcement the demerger may not be completed within expected time periods or at all and both the timing and success of the demerger or any other separation and public listing transaction will be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such transaction any future distribution or sale of our stake in the jv will similarly be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such transaction our ability to complete any such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the size of our retained stake at the time the uncertainty relating to any separation and public listing transactions including the announced demerger their implementation their timing and their yet to be determined effects on the jv’s business may subject us and the jv to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business and financial results 

general risks 

covid19 pandemic 

our business operations and financial condition and results have been and may continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic to varying degrees the pandemic has presented a number of risks and challenges for our business including among others impacts due to travel limitations and mobility restrictions manufacturing disruptions and delays supply chain disruptions and shortages including challenges related to reliance on thirdparty suppliers resulting in reduced availability of materials or components used in the development manufacturing distribution or administration of our products disruptions to pipeline development and clinical trials including difficulties or delays in enrolling certain clinical trials retaining clinical trial participants accessing needed supplies and accruing a sufficient number of cases in certain clinical trials decreased product demand due to reduced numbers of inperson meetings with prescribers patient visits with physicians vaccinations and elective surgeries resulting in fewer new prescriptions or refills of existing prescriptions and reduced demand for products used in procedures reduced product demand as a result of unemployment or increased focus on covid19 vaccination challenges presented by reallocating personnel and rd manufacturing and other resources to assist in responding to the pandemic costs associated with the covid19 pandemic including practices intended to reduce the risk of transmission increased supply chain costs and additional rd costs incurred in our efforts to develop a vaccine to help prevent covid19 and an oral covid19 treatment challenges related to our business development initiatives including potential delays or disruptions related to regulatory approvals interruptions or delays in the operations of regulatory authorities which may delay potential approval of new products we are developing potential label expansions for existing products and the launch of newlyapproved products challenges operating in a virtual work environment increased cyber incidents such as phishing social engineering and malware attacks challenges related to our intellectual property both domestically and internationally including in response to any pressure or legal or regulatory action that could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for licensing or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from enforcing intellectual property rights related to our products including our vaccine to help prevent covid19 and an oral covid19 treatment challenges related to conducting oversight and monitoring of regulated activities in a remote or virtual environment challenges related to our human capital and talent development including challenges in attracting hiring and retaining highly skilled and diverse workforce challenges related to vaccine mandates and other challenges presented by disruptions to our normal operations in response to the pandemic as well as uncertainties regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and its impacts and government or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control the supply of medicines and vaccines 

we also face risks and uncertainties related to our efforts to develop and commercialize a vaccine to help prevent covid19 and an oral covid19 treatment as well as challenges related to their manufacturing supply and distribution including among others 

• uncertainties inherent in rd including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints commencement andor completion dates for clinical trials regulatory submission dates regulatory approval dates andor launch dates as well as risks associated with preclinical and clinical data including the phase 123 or phase 4 data for bnt162b2 or any other vaccine candidate in the bnt162 program or paxlovid or any other future covid19 treatment in any of our studies in pediatrics adolescents or adults or real world evidence including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical clinical or safety data or further information regarding the quality of preclinical clinical or safety data including by audit or inspection 

• the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results for bnt162b2 or paxlovid including the rate of effectiveness andor efficacy safety and tolerability profile observed to date in additional analyses of the phase 3 trial for bnt162b2 or paxlovid and additional studies in realworld data studies or in larger more diverse populations following commercialization 

• the ability of bnt162b2 or any future vaccine to prevent or paxlovid or any other future covid19 treatment to be effective against covid19 caused by emerging virus variants 

• the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine or paxlovid will lead to new information about efficacy safety or other developments including the risk of additional adverse reactions some of which may be serious 

• the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments including during the peer reviewpublication process in the scientific community generally and by regulatory authorities 

• whether and when additional data from the bnt162 mrna vaccine program paxlovid or other programs will be published in scientific journal publications and if so when and with what modifications and interpretations 

• whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies 

• whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for bnt162b2 or any potential future vaccines in additional populations for a booster dose for bnt162b2 or any potential future vaccines including potential future annual boosters or revaccinations andor biologics license andor eua applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for bnt162b2 or any other potential vaccines and if obtained whether or when such eua or licenses will expire or terminate 

• whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for paxlovid or any other future covid19 treatment andor any drug applications for any indication for paxlovid or any other future covid19 treatment may be filed in any jurisdiction and if obtained whether or when such eua or licenses will expire or terminate 

• whether and when any application that may be pending or filed for bnt162b2 or other vaccines that may result from the bnt162 program paxlovid or any other future covid19 treatment or any other covid19 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities which will depend on myriad factors including making a determination as to whether the vaccine’s or drug’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine’s or drug’s efficacy and if approved whether it will be commercially successful 



• decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing manufacturing processes safety andor other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of a vaccine or drug including development of products or therapies by other companies 

• disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners clinical trial sites or thirdparty suppliers including our relationship with biontech 

• the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products 

• the risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist 

• the possibility that covid19 will diminish in severity or prevalence or disappear entirely 

• risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture or test any such products 

• challenges related to our vaccine’s formulation dosing schedule and attendant storage distribution and administration requirements including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by us 

• the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations booster doses or potential future annual boosters or revaccinations or new variantspecific vaccines 

• the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our rd and manufacturing efforts 

• risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide research funding for the bnt162 program paxlovid or any other covid19 program 

• challenges and risks associated with the pace of our development programs 

• the risk that we may not be able to maintain or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our vaccine or any treatment for covid19 which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine or treatment courses of paxlovid within the projected time periods 

• whether and when additional supply or purchase agreements will be reached 

• uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine or treatment advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations 

• pricing and access challenges for such products 

• challenges related to public confidence or awareness of our covid19 vaccine or paxlovid including challenges driven by misinformation access concerns about clinical data integrity and prescriber and pharmacy education 

• trade restrictions 

• potential thirdparty royalties or other claims related to our covid19 vaccine or paxlovid and 

• competitive developments 

further the covid19 pandemic and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic could precipitate or amplify the other risks that we identify in this risk factors section which could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and results 

we are continuing to monitor the latest developments regarding the covid19 pandemic and its effects on our business operations and financial condition and results and have made certain assumptions regarding the covid19 pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections including assumptions regarding the duration severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic as well as covid19 vaccine and oral covid19 treatment supply and contracts which remain dynamic despite careful tracking and planning we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments in particular we believe the ultimate impact on our business operations and financial condition and results will be affected by the speed and extent of the continued spread of the coronavirus globally the emergence of additional virus variants the duration of the pandemic new information regarding the severity and incidence of covid19 the safety efficacy and availability of vaccines and treatments for covid19 the rate at which the population becomes vaccinated against covid19 the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic and governmental or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control supply of medicines and vaccines the pandemic may also affect our business operations or financial condition and results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks 

market fluctuations in our equity and other investments 

changes in fair value of certain equity investments need to be recognized in net income that may result in increased volatility of our income for additional information see note 4 and the analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resources and market risk section within mda 

our pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations are subject to volatility from changes in fair value of equity investments and other investment risk in the assets funding these plans for additional information see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions — benefit plans section within mda and note 11 

cost and expense control and nonordinary events 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings internal reorganizations product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of our costreduction and productivity initiatives other corporate strategic initiatives and any acquisitions divestitures or other initiatives as well as potential disruption of ongoing business 

intangible assets goodwill and equitymethod investments 

our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including iprd and goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired andor be written off at some time in the future if the associated rd effort is abandoned or is curtailed for goodwill all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the 



business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity our other intangible assets including developed technology rights and brands face similar risks for impairment our equitymethod investments may also be subject to impairment charges that may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments we may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment events related to particular customers or asset types challenging market conditions or decisions by management any such impairment charge of our intangible assets goodwill and equitymethod investments may be significant for additional details see the s ignificant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions section within mda 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation including among others changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations internationally and in the us including among other things any potential adoption of global minimum taxation requirements and any potential changes to existing tax law and regulations by the biden administration and congress competition laws privacy laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries for additional information on changes in tax laws or rates or accounting standards see the provisionbenefit for taxes on income and new accounting standards sections within mda and note 1b

overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook 

financial highlights 

the following is a summary of certain financial performance metrics in billions except per share data 





 for additional information regarding adjusted diluted eps which is a nongaap financial measure including reconciliations of certain gaap reported to nongaap adjusted information see the nongaap financial measure adjusted income section within mda 

references to operational variances pertain to periodoverperiod changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results 

our business and strategy 

most of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products with the formation of the consumer healthcare jv in 2019 and the spinoff of our former upjohn business in the fourth quarter of 2020 pfizer transformed into a more focused global leader in sciencebased innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery development manufacturing marketing sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments biopharma and pc1 biopharma is the only reportable segment on december 31 2021 we completed the sale of our meridian subsidiary and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 the financial results of meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 the financial results of the upjohn business and the mylanjapan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented priorperiod information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure see note 1a and item 1 business––commercial operations of this form 10k for additional information we expect to incur costs of approximately 700 million in connection with separating upjohn of which approximately 75 has been incurred since inception and through december 31 2021 these charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs 

transforming to a more focused company we have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating structure while certain direct costs transferred to the consumer healthcare jv and to the upjohn business in connection with the spinoff there are indirect costs which did not transfer we are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business rd and pgs platform functions in addition we are transforming our commercial goto market model in the way we engage patients and physicians see the costs and expenses––restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and costreductionproductivity initiatives section of this mda  

rd we believe we have a strong pipeline and are wellpositioned for future growth rd is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients innovation drug discovery and development are critical to our success in addition to discovering and developing new 



products our rd efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications see the item 1 business — research and development section of this form 10k for our rd priorities and strategy 

we seek to leverage a strong pipeline organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating longterm growth opportunities including 

• an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients’ unmet needs 

• advances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines and 

• the increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems 

our business development initiatives 

we are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products but also through various business development activities we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities we assess our business assets and scientific capabilitiesportfolio as part of our regular ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy 

our significant recent business development activities that closed or are targeted to close in 2022 include 

acquisition of arena 

in december 2021 we and arena announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire arena a clinical stage company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immunoinflammatory diseases under the terms of the agreement we will acquire all outstanding shares of arena for 100 per share in an allcash transaction for a total equity value of approximately 67 billion on february 2 2022 arena shareholders voted to approve the proposed acquisition which is targeted to close in the first half of 2022 subject to review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions 

collaboration with biohaven 

in november 2021 we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with biohaven pharmaceutical holding company ltd biohaven pharmaceutical ireland dac and bioshin limited collectively biohaven pursuant to which we acquired rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the us subject to regulatory approval rimegepant is currently commercialized in the us israel and the uae under the brand name nurtec ® odt with certain additional applications pending outside of the us biohaven will continue to lead rd globally and we have the exclusive right to commercialization globally outside of the us upon the closing of the transaction which occurred on january 4 2022 we paid biohaven 500 million including an upfront payment of 150 million and an equity investment of 350 million biohaven is also eligible to receive up to 740 million in nonus commercialization milestone payments in addition to tiered doubledigit royalties on net sales outside of the us in addition to the milestone payments and royalties above we will also reimburse biohaven for the portion of certain additional milestone payments and royalties due to third parties in accordance with preexisting biohaven agreements which are attributed to exus sales

our operating environment 

we like other businesses in our industry are subject to certain industryspecific challenges these include among others the topics listed below see also the item 1 business––government regulation and price constraints and item 1a risk factors sections of this form 10k 

regulatory environment––pipeline productivity 

our product lines must be replenished to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends as well as to provide for earnings growth as a result we devote considerable resources to our rd activities which while essential to our growth incorporate a high degree of risk and cost including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an inline product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially we conduct clinical trials to provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a product’s overall benefitrisk profile for a particular patient population in addition after a product has been approved or authorized and launched we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients this includes postmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge for the entire life of the product we collect safety data and report safety information to the fda and other regulatory authorities regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety concerns and take regulatory actions in response such as updating a product’s labeling restricting its use communicating new safety information to the public or in rare cases requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the market the commercial potential of inline products may be negatively impacted by postmarketing developments 

intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights 

the loss expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of copromotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years while additional patent expiries will continue we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2022 through 2025 we continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access 

for additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole see the item 1 business––patents and other intellectual property rights section in this form 10k for a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation see note 16a1 

regulatory environmentpricing and access––government and other payer group pressures 

the pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare which includes medicines medical services and hospital services continues to be important to payers governments patients and other stakeholders federal and state governments and private thirdparty payers in the us continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement we consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines and vaccines within the us we often engage with patients doctors and healthcare plans we also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers including pbms and mcos the price that patients pay in the us for prescribed medicines and vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs including proposing pricing reform or legislation cross country collaboration and procurement price cuts mandatory rebates health technology assessments forced localization as a condition of market access “international reference pricing” ie the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries qce processes and vbp in the us we expect to see continued focus by congress and the biden administration on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs for example there is proposed legislation that if enacted would allow medicare to negotiate prices for certain prescription drugs as well as require that penalties be paid by manufacturers who raise drug prices faster than inflation also certain changes proposed by the cms in december 2020 to the medicaid program and 340b drug pricing program which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities could increase our medicaid rebate obligations and increase the discounts we extend to 340b covered entities if they go into effect additional changes to the 340b program are undergoing review and their status is unclear we anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures globally for additional information see the item 1 business –– pricing pressures and managed care organizations and –– government regulation and price constraints sections in this form 10k 

product supply 

we periodically encounter supply delays disruptions or shortages including due to voluntary product recalls such as our recent chantix recall for information on our recent chantix recall and risks related to product manufacturing see the item 1a risk factors––product manufacturing sales and marketing risks section in this form 10k 

the global economic environment 

in addition to the industryspecific factors discussed above we like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities are exposed to economic cycles certain factors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls global economic conditions including inflation restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval 



production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action including the current conflict between russia and ukraine terrorist activity unstable governments and legal systems intergovernmental disputes public health outbreaks epidemics pandemics natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change government pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices access criteria or other means of cost control 

covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted our business operations and financial condition and results 

our response to covid19 

pfizer has helped lead the global effort to confront the covid19 pandemic by advancing a vision for industrywide collaboration while making significant investments in breakthrough science and global manufacturing 

• comirnatybnt162b2  

◦ we have collaborated with biontech to jointly develop comirnatybnt162b2 a mrnabased coronavirus vaccine to help prevent covid19 the fda has approved comirnaty in the us to prevent covid19 in individuals 16 years of age and older as a twodose primary series 30 µg per dose comirnaty is the first covid19 vaccine to be granted approval by the fda and had previously been available to this patient population in the us under an eua since december 2020 the vaccine is also available to individuals 5 to 15 years old under an eua granted by the fda in 2021 10 µg per dose for children 5 through 11 years of age october 2021 and 30 µg per dose for individuals 12 years of age and older may 2021 the fda has also authorized for emergency use i a third dose of comirnatybnt162b2 in certain immunocompromised individuals 5 years of age and older and ii comirnatybnt162b2 as a booster dose in individuals 12 years of age and older comirnatybnt162b2 has also been granted an approval or an authorization in many other countries around the world in populations varying by country we continue to evaluate our vaccine including for additional pediatric indications and the short and longterm efficacy of comirnaty we are also studying vaccine candidates to potentially prevent covid19 caused by new and emerging variants such as the omicron variant or an updated vaccine as needed 

◦ in 2021 we manufactured more than three billion doses and in fiscal 2021 delivered 22 billion doses around the world pfizer and biontech expect we can manufacture up to four billion doses in total by the end of 2022 the companies have entered into agreements to supply prespecified doses of comirnaty in 2022 with multiple developed and emerging countries around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of comirnaty to governments under such agreements we also signed agreements with multiple countries to supply comirnaty doses in 2023 and are currently negotiating similar potential agreements with multiple other countries we anticipate delivering at least two billion doses to low and middleincome countries by the end of 2022—one billion that was delivered in 2021 and one billion expected to be delivered in 2022 with the possibility to increase those deliveries if more orders are placed by these countries for 2022 one billion of the aforementioned doses to low and middleincome countries are being supplied to the us government at a notforprofit price to be donated to the world’s poorest nations at no charge to those countries 

◦ as of february 8 2022 we forecasted approximately 32 billion in revenues for comirnaty in 2022 with gross profit to be split evenly with biontech which includes doses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022 under contracts signed as of latejanuary 2022 

• paxlovid  

◦ in december 2021 the fda authorized the emergency use of paxlovid a novel oral covid19 treatment which is a sarscov23cl protease inhibitor and is coadministered with a low dose of ritonavir for the treatment of mildtomoderate covid19 in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg 88 lbs with positive results of direct sarscov2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progression to severe covid19 including hospitalization or death the fda based its decision on clinical data from the phase 23 epichr evaluation of protease inhibition for covid19 in highrisk patients which enrolled nonhospitalized adults aged 18 and older with confirmed covid19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illness paxlovid has been granted an authorization or approval in many other countries 

◦ we continue to evaluate paxlovid in other populations including in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sarscov2 infection who are at standard risk ie low risk of hospitalization or death phase 23 epicsr evaluation of protease inhibition for covid19 in standard risk patients and in adults living in the same household as someone with a confirmed covid19 infection phase 23 epicpep evaluation of protease inhibition for covid19 in postexposure prophylaxis 

◦ we have entered into agreements with multiple countries to supply prespecified courses of paxlovid such as the us and uk and have initiated bilateral outreach to approximately 100 countries around the world additionally we have signed a voluntary nonexclusive license agreement with the medicines patent pool mpp for paxlovid under the terms of the agreement mpp can grant sublicenses to qualified generic medicine manufacturers worldwide to manufacture and supply paxlovid to 95 low and middleincome countries covering up to approximately 53 of the world’s population 

◦ pfizer plans to manufacture up to 120 million treatment courses by the end of 2022 depending on the global need which will be driven by advance purchase agreements with 30 million courses expected to be produced in the first half of 2022 and the remaining 90 million courses expected to be produced in the second half of 2022 

◦ as of february 8 2022 we forecasted approximately 22 billion of revenues for paxlovid in 2022 which includes treatment courses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022 primarily relating to supply contracts signed or committed as of latejanuary 2022 

• iv protease inhibitor 

◦ in february 2022 we discontinued the global clinical development program for pf07304814 an intravenously administered sarscov2 main protease inhibitor being evaluated in adults hospitalized with severe covid19 this decision was made based on a totality of information including a careful review of early data and a thorough assessment of the candidate’s potential to successfully fulfill patient needs dosing of pf07304814 in the national institutes of health’s ongoing accelerating covid19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines activ3 study has ceased 

impact of covid19 on our business and operations 

as part of our ongoing monitoring and assessment we have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections including assumptions regarding the duration severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic 



as well as covid19 vaccine and oral covid19 treatment supply and contracts which remain dynamic despite careful tracking and planning we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments we are focused on all aspects of our business and are implementing measures aimed at mitigating issues where possible including by using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial manufacturing rd and corporate enabling functions globally 

apart from our introduction of comirnatybnt162b2 and paxlovid our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways our portfolio of products experienced varying impacts from the pandemic in 2021 for example certain of our vaccines such as the prevnar family were impacted by disruptions to healthcare activity related to covid19 including the prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for covid19 for some products such as vyndaqelvyndamax we continued to see postponement of elective and diagnostic procedures in 2021 due to covid19 which may subside in 2022 as covid19 vaccination and booster rates continue to increase andor if covid19 cases subside on the other hand some products such as ibrance saw accelerating demand in 2021 as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by the covid19 pandemic show signs of recovery across several international markets for detail on the impact of the covid19 pandemic on certain of our products see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income—revenues by geography and revenues—selected product discussion sections within this mda 

in 2021 engagement with healthcare professionals started to return to prepandemic levels and we continue to review and assess epidemiological data to inform inperson engagements with healthcare professionals and to help ensure the safety of our colleagues customers and communities as part of our commitment to engaging our customers in the manner they prefer we are also taking a hybrid approach of virtual and in person engagements and saw customer response to both approaches during the pandemic we adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide critical education and information including increasing the scale of our remote engagement most of our colleagues who are able to perform their job functions outside of our facilities continue to temporarily work remotely while certain colleagues in the pgs and wrdm organizations continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission as of december 31 2021 more than 96 of our us employee population had been fully vaccinated or received an approved exception also in 2021 and to date we have not seen a significant disruption to our supply chain and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels however we are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials potentially constraining available supply which could have a future impact on our business we are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible certain of our clinical trials were impacted by the covid19 pandemic in 2021 which included in some cases challenges related to recruiting clinical trial participants and accruing cases in certain studies our clinical trials also progressed in this challenging environment through innovation such as decentralized visits eg telemedicine and home visits to accommodate participants’ ability to maintain scheduled visits as well as working with suppliers to manage the shortage of certain clinical supplies 

we will continue to pursue efforts to maintain the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic future developments could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on our business operations or financial condition and results if we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chains or significant disruptions in clinical trials or other operations or if demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the covid19 pandemic we could experience a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition and results

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

following is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements also see note 1d  

for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 1  of these policies the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments acquisitions  note 1e  fair value  note 1f  revenues  note 1h  asset impairments  note 1m  tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  note 1q  pension and postretirement benefit plans  note 1r  and legal and environmental contingencies  note 1s  

for a discussion of a recently adopted accounting standard and a change in accounting principle related to our pension and postretirement plans see notes 1b and 1c 

acquisitions 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other things that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date for further detail on acquisition accounting see note 1e  historically intangible assets have been the most significant fair values within our business combinations for further information on our process to estimate the fair value of intangible assets see asset impairments below 

revenues 

our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized such variable consideration represents chargebacks rebates sales allowances and sales returns these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and as such knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period historically adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1 of revenues productspecific rebates however can have a significant impact on yearoveryear individual product revenue growth trends if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience our results could be materially affected the potential of our estimates to vary sensitivity differs by program product type of customer and geographic location however estimates associated with us medicare medicaid and performancebased contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay 



between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate settlement an interval that can generally range up to one year because of this lag our recording of adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters rebate accruals are product specific and therefore for any period are impacted by the mix of products sold as well as the forecasted channel mix for each individual product for further information see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income––revenue deductions section within mda and note 1h  

asset impairments 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year we perform impairment testing for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other longlived assets whenever impairment indicators are present when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets our impairment review processes are described in note 1m 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

• a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset for example a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result in generic competition earlier than expected 

• a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the fda or other regulatory authorities that could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product 

• an expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset this could result for example from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability this also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that impacts projected revenue growth as well as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients physicians and payers for iprd projects this could result from among other things a change in outlook based on clinical trial data a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product 

identifiable intangible assets 

we use an income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which incorporates the consideration of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological advancements and risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic origin of the projected cash flows 

while all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment those that are most at risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately 31 billion as of december 31 2021 and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinitelived brand assets iprd assets are highrisk assets given the uncertain nature of rd newly acquired and recently impaired indefinitelived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period as such immediately after acquisition or impairment even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment review work as of december 31 2021 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time 

in our review we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount qualitative factors that we consider include for example macroeconomic and industry conditions overall financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we then perform a quantitative fair value test 

when we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we typically use the income approach the income approach is a forwardlooking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach we use the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then we apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future result s and the item 1a risk factors sections in this form 10k 

benefit plans 

for a description of our different benefit plans see note 11  

our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management the judgments made in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations 





a for detailed assumptions associated with our benefit plans see note 11b  

expected annual rate of return on plan assets 

the assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect our actual historical return experience and our longterm assessment of forwardlooking return expectations by asset classes which is used to develop a weightedaverage expected return based on the implementation of our targeted asset allocation in our respective plans 

the expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our us plans and the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each yearend and the resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year 



the actual return on plan assets was approximately 26 billion during 2021  

discount rate used to measure plan obligations 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our us defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated and modified as required to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aaaa or better that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled the discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least annually by reference to investment grade corporate bonds rated aaaa or better including when there is sufficient data a yieldcurve approach these discount rate determinations are made in consideration of local requirements the measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect the amount of service cost interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year 



the change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of december 31 2021 resulted in a decrease in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately 786 million 

income tax assets and liabilities 

income tax assets and liabilities include income tax valuation allowances and accruals for uncertain tax positions for additional information see notes 1q and 5 as well as the analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resources and market risk section within mda

2021 v 2020 



emerging markets revenues increased 123 billion or 147 in 2021 to 207 billion from 84 billion in 2020 reflecting an operational increase of 122 billion or 145 and a favorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2 the operational increase in emerging markets was primarily driven by revenues from comirnaty and growth from certain products in the hospital therapeutic area eliquis and pc1 partially offset by a decline from the prevnar family 



2020 v 2019 



revenues for 2020 included an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately 700 million or 2 due to covid19 primarily reflecting lower demand for certain products in china and unfavorable disruptions to wellness visits for patients in the us which negatively impacted prescribing patterns for certain products partially offset by increased us demand for certain sterile injectable products and increased adult uptake for the prevnar family in certain international markets resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses and us revenues for comirnaty 

emerging markets revenues decreased 456 million or 5 in 2020 to 84 billion from 88 billion in 2019 and were relatively flat operationally reflecting an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 5 on emerging markets revenues the relatively flat operational performance was primarily driven by growth from eliquis the prevnar family ibrance and zavicefta offset by lower revenues for consumer healthcare reflecting the july 31 2019 completion of the consumer healthcare jv transaction 

revenue deductions 

our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized these deductions represent estimates of related obligations and as such knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period historically adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1 of revenues productspecific rebates however can have a significant impact on yearoveryear individual product revenue growth trends 



revenue deductions are primarily a function of product sales volume mix of products sold contractual or legislative discounts and rebates 

for information on our accruals for revenue deductions including the balance sheet classification of these accruals see note 1h

costs and expenses 

cost of sales 

2021 v 2020 

cost of sales increased 223 billion primarily due to 

• the impact of comirnaty which includes a charge for the 50 gross profit split with biontech and applicable royalty expenses 

• increased sales volumes of other products driven mostly by pc1 and 

• the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and hedging activity on intercompany inventory 

the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to all of the factors discussed above partially offset by an increase in alliance revenues which have no associated cost of sales 

2020 v 2019 

cost of sales increased 431 million primarily due to 

• increased sales volumes 

• an increase in royalty expenses due to an increase in sales of related products

nongaap financial measure adjusted income 

adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance in conjunction with other performance measures as such we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure we use adjusted income certain components of adjusted income and adjusted diluted eps to present the results of our major operations––the discovery development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide––prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows 



a most directly comparable gaap measure 

b the shortterm incentive plans for substantially all nonsalesforce employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance measured in significant part by three metrics one of which is adjusted diluted eps which is derived from adjusted income and accounts for 40 of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance additionally the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by adjusted net income which is derived from adjusted income the bonus pool funding which is largely based on financial performance may be modified by our rd performance as measured by four metrics relating to our pipeline and may be further modified by our compensation committee’s assessment of other factors 

adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted eps are nongaap financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore are limited in their usefulness to investors because of their nonstandardized definitions they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance a limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers these measures are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for their directly comparable gaap measures of net income attributable to pfizer inc common shareholders  components of net income attributable to pfizer inc common shareholders and eps attributable to pfizer inc common shareholders—diluted  respectively see the accompanying reconciliations of certain gaap reported to nongaap adjusted information—certain line items for 2021 2020 and 2019 below 

we also recognize that as internal measures of performance these measures have limitations and we do not restrict our performancemanagement process solely to these measures we also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance for example our rd organization has productivity targets upon which its effectiveness is measured in addition total shareholder return both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans 



purchase accounting adjustments 

adjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and to a much lesser extent depreciation related to the increasedecrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt and the fair value changes for contingent consideration therefore the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products 

the exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs have been expensed however we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own such as different rd costs timelines or resulting sales accordingly this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets internally 

acquisitionrelated items 

adjusted income excludes acquisitionrelated items which are comprised of transaction integration restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition we have made no adjustments for resulting synergies 

the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other more normal business contexts the integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy 

discontinued operations 

adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods but are presented for consistency across all periods 

certain significant items 

adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive andor unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict furthermore in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods for example although major nonacquisitionrelated costreduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business cost productivity or in response to loe or economic conditions legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases which are facts and circumstances specific and in some cases may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition gains and losses on equity securities have a very high degree of inherent market volatility which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products we no longer sell see the reconciliations of gaap reported to nongaap adjusted information––certain line items below for a noninclusive list of certain significant items 

beginning in 2021 we exclude pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses from our measure of adjusted income because of their inherent market volatility which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business 



reconciliations of gaap reported to nongaap adjusted information––certain line items 









a items that reconcile gaap reported to nongaap adjusted balances are shown pretax and include discontinued operations our effective tax rates for gaap reported income from continuing operations were 76 in 2021 53 in 2020 and 52 in 2019 see note 5  our effective tax rates on nongaap adjusted income were 153 in 2021 137 in 2020 and 160 in 2019

analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations 



cash flows from discontinued operations 

cash flows from discontinued operations primarily relate to our former meridian subsidiary upjohn business and the mylanjapan collaboration see note 2b  in 2020 net cash provided by financing activities from discontinued operations primarily reflects issuances of longterm debt  

analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resources and market risk 

due to our significant operating cash flows which is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source as well as our financial assets access to capital markets revolving credit agreements and available lines of credit we believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations our capital allocation objectives and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future 



we focus efforts to optimize operating cash flows through achieving working capital efficiencies that target accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and other working capital excess cash from operating cash flows is invested in money market funds and availableforsale debt securities which consist of primarily highquality highly liquid welldiversified debt securities we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments and monitoring of our liquidity position in response to market changes we typically maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and shortterm investments which together with our available revolving credit facilities are in excess of our commercial paper and other shortterm borrowings 

additionally we may obtain funding through shortterm or longterm sources from our access to the capital markets banking relationships and relationships with other financial intermediaries to meet our liquidity needs 



for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 see the analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows in this mda 

in august 2021 we completed a public offering of 1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured sustainability notes we are using the net proceeds to finance or refinance in whole or in part as follows rd expenses related to our covid19 vaccines capital expenditures in connection with the manufacture and distribution of covid19 vaccines and our other projects that have environmental andor social benefits for additional information see note 7d  

credit ratings 

the cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings and increases or decreases in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing our longterm debt is rated highquality by both sp and moody’s in november 2020 upon the completion of the upjohn separation both moody’s and sp lowered our longterm debt rating one notch to ‘a2’ and ‘a’ respectively and our shortterm rating remained unchanged sp continues to rate our longterm debt rating outlook as stable since november 2020 while moody’s recently upgraded our longterm debt rating outlook to positive in december 2021 



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

capital allocation framework 

our capital allocation framework is devised to facilitate i the achievement of medical breakthroughs through rd investments and business development activities and ii returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our business and strategy section of this mda 

our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants while the dividend level remains a decision of pfizer’s bod and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases barring significant unforeseen events in december 2021 our bod declared a firstquarter dividend of 040 per share payable on march 4 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 28 2022 the firstquarter 2022 cash dividend will be our 333rd consecutive quarterly dividend 

see note 12 for information on the shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced sharepurchase plans including our accelerated share repurchase agreements at december 31 2021 our remaining sharepurchase authorization was approximately 53 billion 

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual and other obligations 

in the ordinary course of business i we enter into offbalance sheet arrangements that may result in contractual and other obligations and ii in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that 



may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities for more information on guarantees and indemnifications see note 16b  

additionally certain of our copromotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions copromotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products furthermore collaboration licensing or other rd arrangements may give rise to potential milestone payments payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development regulatory andor commercialization milestones which may span several years and which may never occur 

our significant contractual and other obligations as of december 31 2021 consisted of 

• longterm debt including current portion see note 7  and related interest payments 

• estimated cash payments related to the tcja repatriation estimated tax liability see note 5  estimated future payments related to the tcja repatriation tax liability that will occur after december 31 2021 total 83 billion of which an estimated 750 million is to be paid in the next twelve months and an estimated 76 billion is to be paid in periods thereafter 

• certain commitments totaling 52 billion of which an estimated 15 billion is to be paid in the next twelve months and 37 billion in periods thereafter  see note 16c  

• purchases of property plant and equipment  see note 9  in 2022 we expect to spend approximately 33 billion on property plant and equipment and 

• future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases see note 15

foreign exchange risk —the fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this analysis holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not have any effect on another currency’s rates relative to the us dollar if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 as of december 31 2021 the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant 

interest rate risk —the fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes in this analysis holding all other assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2021 the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant 

equity price risk ––we hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions while we are holding such securities we are subject to equity price risk and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments from time to time we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations which may include limiting our price risk our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes in this sensitivity analysis the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant

commercial operations 

in 2020 we managed our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two businesses—biopharma and through november 16 2020 upjohn each led by a single manager 

on november 16 2020 we completed the spinoff and combination of the upjohn business with mylan following the combination we now operate as a focused innovative biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery development manufacturing marketing sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 the financial results of the upjohn business are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented priorperiod information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure following the separation of the upjohn business in 2019 consumer healthcare which was our otc medicines business was

research and development 

rd is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients the discovery and development of drugs and biological products are time consuming costly and unpredictable in addition to discovering and developing new products our rd efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications 

our rd priorities and strategy our rd priorities include 

• delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need 

• advancing our capabilities that can position us for longterm rd leadership and 

• advancing new models for partnerships with creativity flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible 

to that end our rd primarily focuses on our main therapeutic areas 

while a significant portion of our rd is internal we also seek promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines we do so by entering into collaboration alliance and license agreements with universities biotechnology companies and other firms as well as through acquisitions and investments we also have arrangements with third parties that fund a portion of the development costs of one or more of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive future payments such as milestonebased revenue sharing or profitsharing payments or royalties these collaboration alliance license and funding agreements and investments allow us to share knowledge risk and cost they also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and inlicensed or acquired products for information on certain of these collaborations alliances license and funding arrangements and investments see note 2  

our rd operations in 2020 we continued to strengthen our global rd operations and pursue strategies to improve rd productivity to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time  our rd activity is conducted through various platform functions that operate in parallel within our global operations including the following 

• wrdm research units are generally responsible for research and earlystage development assets for our business assets that have not yet achieved proofofconcept and are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility cohesiveness and focus we can rapidly redeploy resources within a research unit and between various projects to leverage as necessary common skills expertise or focus 

• gpd gpd is a unified center for clinical development and regulatory activities that is generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational execution of clinical trials for both earlystage assets in the wrdm portfolio as well as latestage assets in our portfolio 

• sciencebased platformservices organizations these organizations provide technical expertise and other services to various rd projects and are organized into sciencebased functions which are part of our wrdm organization such as pharmaceutical sciences and medicine design these organizations allow us to react more quickly and effectively to evolving needs by sharing resources among projects candidates and targets across therapeutic areas and phases of development another platformservice organization is the worldwide medical and safety wms group which includes worldwide safety surveillance medical information and the chief medical office the wms group provides patients healthcare providers pharmacists payers and health authorities with complete and uptodate information about the risks and benefits associated with pfizer’s rd programs and marketed products so they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use our products 

we manage rd operations on a totalcompany basis through our platform functions described above specifically the portfolio strategy  investment committee comprised of senior executives is accountable for aligning resources among all of our wrdm gpd and rd projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative rd portfolio we believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility 

we do not disaggregate total rd expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since as described above we do not manage our rd operations by development phase or by therapeutic area further as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly we believe that any priorperiod information about rd expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending 

in 2020 the rd organization within upjohn supported the offpatent branded and generic established medicines and managed its resources separately from the wrdm and gpd organizations following the spinoff and combination of the upjohn business with mylan to create viatris we have agreed to provide certain transition services to viatris including support for rd pharmacovigilance and safety surveillance 

for additional information see the costs and expenses — research and development rd expenses section within mda 



our rd pipeline the process of drug and biological product discovery from initiation through development and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take more than ten years as of february 2 2021 we had the following number of projects in various stages of rd 

development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs while our drug candidates may or may not receive regulatory approval new candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income—product developments section within mda for information on the risks associated with rd see the item 1a risk factors—research and development section of this form 10k 

international operations 

our operations are conducted globally and we sell our products in over 125 countries emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastestgrowing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets provide potential growth opportunities for our products 

revenues from operations outside the us of 202 billion accounted for 48 of our total revenues in 2020 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 8 10 and 10 countries outside the us in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively by total revenues china and japan are our two largest national markets outside the us for a geographic breakdown of revenues see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues by geography section within mda and the table captioned geographic information in note 17a  

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — global operations and item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints sections in this form 10k 

sales and marketing 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies in the us we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government cdc wholesalers individual provider offices retail pharmacies and integrated delivery networks outside the us we primarily sell our vaccines to government and nongovernment institutions a portion of our government contracts are subject to renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the discretion of a government entity we seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and pbm formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the pbms pbms use various benefit designs such as tiered copays for formulary products to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions we may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and physicians on key disease areas for information on our largest biopharmaceutical wholesalers see note 17b  



we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers mcos that provide insurance coverage such as hospitals integrated delivery systems pbms and health plans and employers and government agencies who hire mcos to provide health benefits to their employees we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

patents  we own or license a number of patents covering pharmaceutical and other products their uses formulations and product manufacturing processes 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the scope of protection afforded by a patent can vary from country to country and depends on the patent type the scope of its patent claims and the availability of legal remedies patent term extensions pte may be available in some countries to compensate for a loss of patent term due to delay in a product’s approval due to the regulatory requirements one of the primary considerations in limiting our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products although international and us free trade agreements have included some improved global protection of intellectual property rights for additional information see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k 

in various markets a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided for drugs upon approval the scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but in general the period will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval 

based on current sales and considering the competition with products sold by our competitors the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic product patent expires are as follows 



1 unless otherwise indicated the years pertain to the basic product patent expiration including granted ptes supplementary protection certificates spc or pediatric exclusivity periods spcs are included when granted in three out of five major european markets france germany italy spain and the uk noted in parentheses is the projected year of expiry of the earliest pending patent term extension in the us or japan andor spc application in europe the term of which if granted may be shorter than originally requested due to a number of factors in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products which may or may not protect our drug from generic or biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

2 the basic product patent for chantix in the us expired in november 2020 

3 xeljanz europe expiry is provided by regulatory exclusivity 

4 the europe patent that covers the combination of the 13 serotype conjugates of prevenar 13 was revoked following an opposition and has now been withdrawn there are other europe patents and pending applications covering the formulation various aspects of the manufacturing process and the combination of serotype conjugates of prevenar 13 that remain in force 

5 eliquis was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with bms for eliquis in the us two patents listed in the fda orange book the composition of matter patent claiming apixaban specifically and a formulation patent were challenged by numerous generic companies and are the subject of patent infringement litigation prior to the august 2020 ruling referenced in the following sentence we and bms settled with a number of these generic companies settled generic companies while continuing to litigate against three remaining generic companies remaining generic companies in august 2020 the us district court for the district of delaware decided that the two challenged eliquis patents are both valid and infringed by the remaining generic companies the remaining generic companies have appealed the delaware court decision and the final decision in this case could determine when generic versions of eliquis will come on the market 

while we cannot predict the outcome of this pending litigation these are the alternatives that might occur a if the district court’s decision is upheld in the current appeal with respect to both patents under the terms of previously executed settlement agreements with the settled generic companies the permitted date of launch for the settled generic companies under these patents is april 1 2028 b if the formulation patent is held invalid or not infringed in the current appeal the settled generic companies and the remaining generic companies would be permitted to launch on november 21 2026 or c if both patents are held invalid or not infringed in the current appeal the settled generic companies and the remaining generic companies could launch products immediately upon such an adverse decision 

in addition both patents may be subject to subsequent challenges by parties other than the remaining generic companies if this were to occur depending on the outcome of the subsequent challenge the potential launch by generic companies including challengers if successful could occur on timelines similar to those discussed above

6 xtandi is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with astellas which has exclusive commercialization rights for xtandi outside the us pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international xtandi net sales 

7 besponsa japan expiry is provided by regulatory exclusivity 

8 we have exclusive rights to braftovi and mektovi in the us the pierre fabre group has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in europe and ono pharmaceutical co ltd has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in japan we receive royalties from the pierre fabre group and ono pharmaceutical co ltd on sales of braftovi and mektovi outside the us 

9 mektovi us expiry is provided by a method of use patent 

10 bavencio is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with merck kgaa 

the loss expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of copromotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues once patent protection has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge we typically lose exclusivity on these products and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similar products and sell them for a lower price the date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however when generic or biosimilar competition does commence the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products often in a very short period of time also if one of our productrelated patents is found to be invalid by judicial court or regulatory or administrative proceedings generic or biosimilar products could be introduced resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products 

we continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — intellectual property protection — third party intellectual property claims and — competitive products sections in this form 10k and note 16a1  

losses of product exclusivity certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years the basic product patent for chantix in the us expired on november 10 2020 also the basic product patent for sutent in the us will expire in august 2021 for additional information on the impact of loes on our revenues see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income––revenues––selected product discussion section within mda 

trademarks  our products are sold under brandname and logo trademarks and trade dress registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms and protection is provided in some countries for as long as the mark is used while in others for as long as it is registered protecting our trademarks is of material importance to pfizer

our business is conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost though the means of competition vary among our products demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success 

we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products these competitors include other worldwide researchbased biopharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers our competitors also may devote substantial funds and resources to rd and their successful rd could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence in addition several of our competitors operate without large rd expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration 

to address competitive trends we continually emphasize innovation which is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in rd as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research continues even after drug approval as we seek to further demonstrate the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we educate patients physicians payers and global health authorities on the benefits and risks of our medicines and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical functions including to accurately and ethically launch and market our products to our customers 

operating conditions have also shifted as a result of increased global competitive pressures industry regulation and cost containment we continue to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices in an effort to better meet customer and public needs we believe that we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through our support for better healthcare solutions 

our vaccines may face competition from the introduction of alternative vaccines or “nextgeneration” vaccines prior to or after the expiration of their patents which may adversely affect our future results 

our biosimilars compete with branded products from competitors as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers we sell biosimilars of certain inflammation  immunology and oncology biologic medicines we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “firsttomarket” or early market position for our biosimilars to provide customers a lowercost alternative immediately when available and also to potentially provide us with higher levels of sales and profitability until other competitors enter the market 



generic products  generic pharmaceutical manufacturers pose one of the biggest competitive challenges to our branded small molecule products because they can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less several competitors regularly challenge our product patents before their expiration generic competitors often operate without large rd expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product in china for example we are expected to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2021 and beyond which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products in addition generic versions of competitors’ branded products may also compete with our products 

mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us and us laws generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for brandname drugs in a small subset of states prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution 

biosimilars certain of our biologic products including enbrel we market enbrel outside the us and canada already face or may face in the future competition from biosimilars also referred to as followon biologics biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety purity or potency biosimilars have the potential to offer highquality lowercost alternatives to innovative biologic medicines in the us biosimilars referencing innovative biologic products are approved under the us public health service act 

pricing pressures and managed care organizations 

pricing pressures pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continue to be significant overall there is increasing pressure on us providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes many employers have adopted high deductible health plans which can increase outofpocket costs for medicines this trend is likely to continue private thirdparty payers such as health plans increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing which could result in lower prices lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products pricing pressures also may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets healthcare provider purchasers directly or through group purchasing organizations are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes 

longer term we foresee a shift in focus away from feeforservice payments towards outcomesbased payments and risksharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes these new payment models can at times lead to lower prices for and restricted access to new medicines at the same time these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions 

we believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes lower costs to the healthcare system and help ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system in addition in response to the evolving us and global healthcare spending landscape we work with health authorities health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major us payers throughout the productdevelopment process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products further we seek to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop register and manufacture by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs

managed care organizations the evolution of managed care in the us has been a major factor in the competitiveness of the healthcare marketplace approximately 299 million people in the us now have some form of health insurance coverage and the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage coverage in the us continues to grow in importance in particular the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos at the same time consolidation in the mco industry has resulted in fewer even larger entities which enhances mcos’ ability to negotiate pricing and increases their importance to our business since mcos seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures their growing influence has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues 

mcos typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to mco members clinical protocols which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine volume purchasing longterm contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs in addition by placing branded medicines on highertier or nonpreferred status in their formularies mcos transfer a portion of the cost to the patient resulting in significant patient outofpocket expenses this financial disincentive is a tool for mcos to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the mcos the aca has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes we are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them 

the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as ways to manage costs hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed and drugs that can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or surgery may become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 



exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population and beyond consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products typically on the basis of unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects as well as the overall cost of the therapy we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies however increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a nonpreferred status for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — managed care trends section in this form 10k 

raw materials 

we procure raw materials essential to our business from numerous suppliers worldwide in general these materials have been available in sufficient quantities to support our demand and in many cases are available from multiple suppliers we have supplier management activities in place to monitor supply channels and to take action as needed to secure necessary volumes no significant impact to our operations due to the availability of raw materials is currently anticipated in 2021 

government regulation and price constraints 

we are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which we do business this includes laws and regulations governing pharmaceutical companies such as the approval manufacturing and marketing of products pricing including discounts and rebates and health information privacy among others these laws and regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and administrative actions enforcement measures may include substantial fines andor penalties orders to stop noncompliant activities criminal charges warning letters product recalls or seizures delays in product approvals exclusion from participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions and could result in harm to our reputation and business for additional information see note 16a compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance while capital expenditures or operating costs for compliance with government regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

in the united states 

drug and biologic regulation  the fda pursuant to the ffdca the public health service act and other federal statutes and regulations extensively regulates pre and postmarketing activities related to our biopharmaceutical products the regulations govern areas such as the safety and efficacy of medicines clinical trials advertising and promotion quality control manufacturing labeling distribution postmarketing safety surveillance and reporting and record keeping other us federal agencies including the dea also regulate certain of our products and activities many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec 

for a biopharmaceutical company to market a drug or a biologic product in the us the fda must evaluate whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use if the fda determines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective the fda will approve the product’s nda or biologics license application bla or supplemental nda or supplemental bla as appropriate 

a drug or biologic may be subject to postmarketing commitments which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct or postmarketing requirements which are studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval once a drug or biologic is approved the fda must be notified of any product modifications and may require additional studies or clinical trials in addition we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cgmps the fda regulations that govern all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals as well as advertising and promotion regulations for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — development regulatory approval and marketing of products and — postapproval data section in this form 10k 

in the context of public health emergencies like the covid19 pandemic we may apply for eua with the fda which when granted allows for the distribution and use of our products during the term declared and extended by the government in accordance with the conditions set forth in the eua unless the eua is otherwise terminated at the government’s discretion although the criteria of an eua differ from the criteria for approval of an nda or bla euas nevertheless require the development and submission of data to satisfy the relevant fda standards and a number of ongoing compliance obligations the fda expects eua holders to work toward submission of full applications such as a bla as soon as possible for bnt162b2 we are working towards submitting a bla for possible full regulatory approval 

biosimilar regulation the fda is responsible for approval of biosimilars innovator biologics are entitled to 12 years of market exclusivity by statute and biosimilars applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic 

sales and marketing regulations  our marketing practices are subject to state laws as well as federal laws such as the antikickback statute and false claims act intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry the antikickback statute generally prohibits soliciting offering receiving or paying anything of value to generate business the false claims act generally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented any claims for payment for goods or services to thirdparty payers including medicare and medicaid that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent the federal government and states also regulate sales and marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers requiring disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions and the adoption of compliance standards or programs state attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

healthcare reform  any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us this includes potential replacements for the aca if it is ultimately invalidated by the us supreme court in california v texas  as well as efforts at the state level to develop additional public insurance options or implement a single payer healthcare system we do not expect that invalidation of the aca itself would have a material impact on our business given the modest revenues the health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion generate for us however a future replacement of the aca or other healthcare reform efforts may adversely affect our business and financial results particularly if such replacement or reform reduces incentives for employersponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increases industry taxes and fees 



pricing and reimbursement  pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation in order to have our products covered by medicaid we must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state programs we also must report specific prices to government agencies the calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose us to enforcement measures see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues by geography section within mda and note 1g 

government and private payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products and there is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products including proposed actions to facilitate drug importation limit reimbursement to lower international reference prices require deep discounts and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and sometimes a written justification for the increase could adversely affect our business if implemented in the fall of 2020 the trump administration finalized an importation pathway from canada and a payment model to tie medicare part b physician reimbursement to international prices though ultimate implementation of both is uncertain due to legal challenges we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional legislation and regulation under the newly elected congress and the biden administration in addition us government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — pricing and reimbursement section in this form 10k 

a majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under medicaid including some of our products for example access to our products under the medicaid and medicare managed care programs typically is determined by the health plans with which state medicaid agencies and medicare contract to provide services to beneficiaries states seek to control healthcare costs related to medicaid and other state healthcare programs including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under the medicaid drug rebate program tied to patient outcomes in addition we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains wholesalers and pbms will increase pricing pressures in the industry for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — managed care trends section in this form 10k 

anticorruption the fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations 

data privacy the collection and use of personal data by us as part of our business activities is subject to various federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies such laws and regulations have the potential to affect our business materially continue to evolve and are increasingly being enforced vigorously 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most countries outside the us 

new drug approvals in the eu the ema conducts the scientific evaluation supervision and safety monitoring of our innovative medicinal products and employs a centralized procedure for approval for the eu and the european economic area eea countries from january 1 2021 as a consequence of the uk leaving the eu brexit the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency is the sole regulatory authority for the uk in china following significant regulatory reforms in recent years the nmpa is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines in japan the pmda is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities including clinical studies approvals postmarketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety health authorities in many middle and lowerincome require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority ie the fda or ema before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval 

pharmacovigilance in the eueea the ema’s pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues outside developed markets pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive but there is a trend toward increasing regulation 

pricing and reimbursement  certain governments including in the different eu member states the uk china japan canada and south korea provide healthcare at lowtozero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global financing pressures governments may use a variety of measures including proposing price reform or legislation cross country collaboration and procurement price cuts mandatory rebates health technology assessments forced localization as a condition of market access “international reference pricing” ie the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries qce processes and vbp in addition the international patchwork of price regulation differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries several important multilateral organizations such as the world health organization and the organization for economic cooperation and development are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations on november 25 2020 the european commission published its new pharmaceutical strategy for europe which envisions a broad range of new initiatives and legislation including a significant focus on affordability and access to medicines 

in china pricing pressures have increased in recent years with government officials emphasizing improved health outcomes healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards reform drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of adding innovative drugs including oncology medicines to the national reimbursement drug list nrdl in the offpatent space numerous local generics have been officially deemed bioequivalent under a qce process that required domesticallymanufactured generic drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug typically the originator drug a centralized vbp program has also been initiated and expanded nationwide under which a tender process has been established where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners the program is intended to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed qce which has resulted in dramatic price cuts for offpatent medicines furthermore the chinese government has discussed moving toward efforts to unify the reimbursement price between qceapproved generic medicines and the applicable original medicines which the government currently plans to 



implement within the next few years we and most offpatent originators have mostly not been successful in the vbp bidding process the government has indicated that additional postloe drugs could be subjected to qce qualification in future rounds which could also be tied to volumebased procurement while certain details of future qce expansion have been made available we are unable to determine the impact on our business and financial condition until the initiation of these future rounds 

healthcare provider transparency and disclosures several countries have implemented laws requiring or their industry associations have recommended disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers 

intellectual property  reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and rd investment the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights wtotrips requires participant countries to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by law with an exemption provided for leastdeveloped countries until 2033 while some countries have made improvements we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries 

while the global intellectual property environment has generally improved following wtotrips and bilateralmultilateral trade agreements our growth and ability to bring new product innovation to patients depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in certain developed international markets governments maintain relatively effective intellectual property policies however in the eu following a review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives legislative change may result in the reduction of certain protections in several emerging market countries governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals 

considerable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions revocation of patents laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection 

our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries and helping improve patients’ access to innovative medicines 

data privacy outside of the us many countries have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data including the eu’s general data protection regulations the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt privacy and data security laws 

environmental matters 

our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2020 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 42 million in environmentrelated capital expenditures and 120 million in other environmentrelated expenses 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position see also note 16a3  

climate change presents risks to our operations including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers we cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities or supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we periodically review our vulnerability to potential weatherrelated risks and other natural disasters and update our assessments accordingly based on our reviews we do not believe these potential risks are material to our operations at this time 

human capital

risks related to our business industry and operations 

managed care trends 

private payers such as health plans and other managed care entities such as pbms continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs negotiating power of mcos and other private thirdparty payers has increased due to consolidation and they along with governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement these initiatives have increased consumers’ interest and input in medication choices as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lowercost generic alternatives we may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing 

the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions which typically have smaller patient populations combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products also has generated increased payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector 

thirdparty payers also use additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing and valuebased pricingcontracting to improve their cost containment efforts and are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us private thirdparty payer market consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form we may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers as they continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action as well as evolving judicial interpretations our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such government and industry guidance 

competitive products 

competitive product launches may erode future sales of our products including our existing products and those currently under development or result in unanticipated product obsolescence such launches have recently occurred and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products that treat diseases and conditions like those treated by our inline drugs and drug candidates 

in addition competition from manufacturers of generic drugs including from generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity is a major challenge for our branded products certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years for example the basic product patent for chantix in the us expired in november 2020 while multisource generic competition for chantix has not yet begun it could commence at anytime also the basic product patent for sutent in the us will expire in august 2021 in china we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturers which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products 

in addition our patented products may face generic competition before patent exclusivity expires including upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products generic manufacturers have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that they claim do not infringe our patents or claim that our patents are not valid these include candidates that would compete with among other products eliquis ibrance and xeljanz our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or copromotion rights 

we may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars 

we also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others including other biosimilar products uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factors such as anticompetitive practices access challenges where our product may not receive appropriate coveragereimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the innovative product or misaligned financial incentives for example inflectra has experienced access challenges among commercial payers in september 2017 pfizer filed suit in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against jj alleging that jj’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning remicade ® infliximab violate federal antitrust laws 

for additional information on competition our products face see the item 1 business — competition section in this form 10k 

concentration 

we recorded direct product andor alliance revenues of more than 1 billion for each of seven products that collectively accounted for 53 of our total revenues in 2020 for additional information see notes 1 and 17  if these products or any of our other major products were to experience loss of patent protection if applicable changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects or safety concerns regulatory proceedings negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling pricing and access pressures or supply shortages or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant in particular certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years and patents covering a number of our bestselling products are or have been the subject of pending legal challenges for additional information on our patents see the item 1 business — patents and other intellectual property rights section in this form 10k 



in addition we sell our prescription pharmaceutical products principally through wholesalers in the us for additional information see note 17b  if one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler does with us andor we might be unable to timely collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers including us 

research and development 

the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our business our product lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share as well as to provide for earnings growth either through internal rd or through collaborations acquisitions jvs licensing or other arrangements growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers however balancing current growth investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge the costs of product development continue to be high as are regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas which may affect the number of candidates we are able to fund as well as the sustainability of the rd portfolio 

decisions made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities if the candidate receives regulatory approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges but there is no assurance that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved 

additionally our product candidates can fail at any stage of the rd process and may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of rd we may fail to correctly identify indications for which our science is promising or allocate rd investment resources efficiently and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic areas product classes geographic markets andor licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if we identify areas with the greatest commercial potential the scientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for rd and the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement 

global operations 

we operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls global economic conditions expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political or civil unrest terrorist activity unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes 

some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending as a result of these and other factors our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful and growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable 

in addition since a significant portion of our business is conducted in the eu as well as the uk the changes resulting from brexit may pose certain implications for our research commercial and general business operations in the uk and the eu 

government financing and economic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices access criteria eg through health technology assessments or other means of cost control for additional information on government pricing pressures see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k 

we continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments that could impact our business if trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economic activity potential impacts could include declining sales increased costs volatility in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments required increases of our pension funding obligations increased government cost control efforts delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

we operate in many countries and transact in over 100 different currencies changes in the value of those currencies relative to the us dollar or high inflation in these countries can impact our revenues costs and expenses and our financial guidance significant portions of our revenues costs and expenses as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to exchange rate changes 48 of our total 2020 revenues were derived from international operations including 23 from europe and 17 from china japan and the rest of asia future changes in exchange rates or economic conditions and the impact they may have on our results of operations financial condition or business are difficult to predict for additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk see the analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resources and market risk—selected measures of liquidity and capital resources section within mda 

in addition our borrowing pension benefit and postretirement benefit obligations and interestbearing investments are subject to risk from changes in interest and exchange rates the risks related to interestbearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resources and market risk—selected measures of liquidity and capital resources section within mda for additional details on critical accounting estimates and assumptions for our benefit plans see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions—benefit plans section within mda and notes 7e and 11  

from time to time we issue variable rate debt based on libor or undertake interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates that are currently used to calculate libor after 2021 this deadline was extended until june 2023 for a number of key us dollar benchmark maturities including the 1month and 3month libor rates the us federal reserve has selected the secured overnight funding rate sofr as the preferred alternate rate and the transition away from libor will continue despite the extended timeline we are planning for this transition and will amend 



any contracts to accommodate the sofr rate where required while our exposure to libor is very low market volatility related to the transition may adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks 

product manufacturing sales and marketing risks 

we could encounter difficulties or delays in product manufacturing sales or marketing due to regulatory actions shutdowns work stoppages or strikes approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions shortages or stockouts reputational harm damage to our facilities due to natural or manmade disasters product liability or unanticipated costs examples of such difficulties or delays include the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand challenges related to component materials to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout our supply network andor comply with applicable regulations and supply chain disruptions at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor 

regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities to evaluate compliance with cgmp or other applicable requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions such as warning letters suspension of manufacturing seizure of product injunctions debarment product recalls delays or denials of product approvals import bans or denials of import certifications for example in september 2017 our subsidiary meridian received a warning letter from the fda asserting the fda’s view that certain violations of cgmp and quality system regulations exist at meridian’s manufacturing sites in st louis missouri and classifying the site as official action indicated oai meridian responded to the warning letter and committed to making improvements across the sites we have made considerable progress addressing the concerns raised by the fda and communication with the fda is ongoing future fda inspections and regulatory activities will further assess the adequacy and sustainability of these corrections implemented at the site as a result of the oai classification the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval of applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates related to products manufactured at our st louis sites 

collaborations and other relationships with third parties 

we depend on thirdparty collaborators service providers and others in the research development manufacturing and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into jvs and other business development transactions to achieve expected longerterm benefits we may make substantial upfront payments as part of these transactions which may negatively impact our reported earnings or cash flows we rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development manufacturing and commercialization activities but we do not control many aspects of those activities we also outsource certain services including activities related to transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial recruitment and execution clinical lab services nonclinical research safety services integrated facilities management and other areas failure by one or more of the thirdparty collaborators service providers and others to complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations or to meet their contractual or other obligations to us failure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any disruption in the relationships between us and these parties could delay or prevent the development approval manufacturing or commercialization of our products and product candidates expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues erroneous data and supply disruptions and could also result in noncompliance with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or subject us to reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business further our alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and copromotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time 

counterfeit products 

our reputation and promising pipeline render our medicines prime targets for counterfeiters counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured — often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites — as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate this threat could adversely impact our business by among other things causing patient harm the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation 

the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including the adoption of ecommerce which increased during the covid19 pandemic greatly enhancing consumers’ ability to obtain prescriptions and other medical treatments via the internet in lieu of traditional brick and mortar pharmacies the internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams because of the anonymity it affords counterfeiters 

we consistently invest in an enterprisewide strategy to aggressively combat counterfeit threats by educating patients and health care providers about the risks proactively monitoring and interdicting supply with the help of law enforcement and advising legislators and regulators however our efforts and those of others may not be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase 

risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings 

pricing and reimbursement 

us and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls or limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions more restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue we expect pricing pressures will continue globally 

in the us pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and calls for reform and many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures as a result some states have implemented and others are considering price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some are considering measures that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible state legislatures also have recently focused on addressing drug costs generally by increasing price transparency or limiting drug price increases measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products including legislation on drug importation 



could adversely affect our business for additional information on us pricing and reimbursement see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we operate in certain markets such as in eu member states the uk china japan canada and south korea governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices access criteria or impose other means of cost control particularly as a result of recent global financing pressures for example the qce and vbp tender process in china has resulted in dramatic price cuts for offpatent medicines for additional information regarding these government initiatives see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k we anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures in china and elsewhere in the future in addition in many countries with respect to our vaccines we participate in a tender process for selection in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business we also anticipate pricing pressures will be amplified by covid19 induced budget deficits and focus on pricing for new covid19 therapies and vaccines 

us healthcare reform 

the us healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes any significant efforts at the us federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us for additional information on us healthcare reform see the item 1 business––government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k 

other us federal or state legislative or regulatory action andor policy efforts could adversely affect our business including among others general budget control actions changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs to the us at prices that are regulated by foreign governments revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government programs that could reference international prices or require new discounts restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals and other industry stakeholders or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 

a reduction of us federal spending on entitlement programs including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products the congressional budget office routinely releases options for reducing federal spending that could affect pharmaceutical utilization and pricing as does the medicare payment advisory commission these and any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

the discovery and development of drugs and biological products are time consuming costly and unpredictable the outcome is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk due to the following factors among others 

• the process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years 

• product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process including as the result of unfavorable preclinical and clinical trial results or unfavorable new preclinical or clinical data and further analyses of existing preclinical or clinical data including results that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or indication 

• we may not be able to meet anticipated preclinical or clinical endpoints commencement andor completion dates for our preclinical or clinical trials regulatory submission dates regulatory approval dates andor launch dates 

• we may not be able to successfully address all the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the fda and the ema or be able to obtain approval from regulators 

regulatory approvals of our products depend on myriad factors including a regulator making a determination as to whether a product is safe and efficacious in the context of public health emergencies like the covid19 pandemic regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency basis additionally clinical trial and other product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities as a result of regulatory interpretations and assessments or other developments that occur during the review process and even after a product is authorized or approved for marketing a product’s commercial potential could be adversely affected by potential emerging concerns or regulatory decisions regarding or impacting labeling or marketing manufacturing processes safety andor other matters 

we may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees such as the acip that may impact the use of our products further claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of inline products and product candidates can negatively impact product sales and potentially lead to product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims further regulatory agency requirements may result in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for among other things additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements for these and other reasons discussed in this risk factors section we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product the fda may require additional clinical trials or other studies the results generated in these trials could result in the loss of marketing approval changes in labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects efficacy or safety regulatory agencies in countries outside the us often have similar regulations and may impose comparable requirements postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others whether mandated by regulatory agencies or conducted voluntarily and other emerging data about products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products further if safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a product in the same class as one of our products those concerns could implicate the entire class and this in turn could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our products as well as 



other products in the class the potential regulatory and commercial implications of postmarketing study results for approved indications and potential new indications of an inline product typically cannot immediately be determined for example the potential impact of the coprimary endpoint results from a recently completed postmarketing required safety study of xeljanz oral surveillance a3921133 announced in january 2021 and related results analyses and discussions with and reviews by regulators remain uncertain we are working with the fda and other regulatory agencies to review the full results and analyses as they become available 

the terms of our eua for the bnt162b2 vaccine require that we conduct postauthorization observational studies in addition the fda expects eua holders to work towards submission of full application such as a bla as soon as possible 

legal matters 

we are and may be involved in various legal proceedings including patent litigation product liability and other productrelated litigation including personal injury consumer offlabel promotion securities antitrust and breach of contract claims commercial environmental government investigations employment tax litigation and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations 

government investigations and actions could result in substantial fines andor criminal charges and civil penalties limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions as well as reputational harm including as a result of increased public interest in the matter in addition in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government 

our sales and marketing activities and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this form 10k as well as the antikickback statute antibribery laws the false claims act and similar laws in international jurisdictions in addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation settlement precedent advisory opinions and special fraud alerts our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of developments requirements or industry standards in the us and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions if an interaction is found to be improper government enforcement actions and penalties could result like many companies in our industry we have from timetotime received and may receive in the future inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities in addition we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries such claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged noncompliance with laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product approved and unapproved information potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational damage this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

in connection with the resolution of a us government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to medicare patients in 2018 we entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services which is effective for a period of five years in the cia we agreed to implement andor maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirements breaches of the cia could result in severe sanctions against us 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to legal claims and proceedings including environmental contingencies amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions while we have accrued for worldwide legal liabilities there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued 

for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in see note 16a  

risks related to intellectual property technology and security 

intellectual property protection 

our success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term made by parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area 

the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinct patent laws and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country its enforcement practices and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices 



that weaken a country’s intellectual property framework eg laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches that challenge our patent rights most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products uses processes or dosage forms are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of or attempts to enforce patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition andor violations of antitrust laws such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents we are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers payers governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry we also are often involved in other proceedings such as inter partes review postgrant review reexamination or opposition proceedings before the us patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others also if one of our patents or a competitors’ patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings generic or biosimilar products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved see note 16a1  further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our rights we seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

third party intellectual property claims 

a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were improperly granted including challenges through negotiation and litigation and such challenges may not always be successful 

part of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities which may involve litigation associated costs and time delays and may ultimately not be successful these opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid or where products do not infringe the patents of others in some circumstances we may take action such as litigation asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a “firsttomarket” or early market position for our products 

third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and timeconsuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launches and may result in significant damages we are involved in patentrelated disputes with third parties over our attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic products or biosimilars we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings including any appeals have not been resolved ie “atrisk” launch if one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party such third party may be awarded significant damages or we may be prevented from further sales of that product such damages may be enhanced as much as threefold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party 

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business we extensively rely upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business we collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including personal information and intellectual property and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we have outsourced significant elements of our operations including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we manage relationships with many thirdparty vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems and those of our thirdparty vendors and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or malicious attackers cyberattacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal groups “hacktivists” nation states and others as a global pharmaceutical company our systems are subject to frequent cyberattacks due to the nature of some of these attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology our efforts may not prevent service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 



risks related to business development 

business development activities 

we expect to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through various forms of business development which can include alliances licenses jvs collaborations equity or debtbased investments dispositions divestments mergers and acquisitions the success of these activities is dependent on the availability and accurate costbenefit evaluation of appropriate opportunities competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions including the ability to satisfy closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes or at all and successfully integrate acquisitions pursuing these opportunities may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which could result in increased leverage andor a downgrade of our credit ratings where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities the value of those securities will fluctuate and may depreciate we may not control a company in which we invest and as a result we will have limited ability to determine its management operational decisions and policies further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess the success of any of our acquisitions will depend when applicable on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating these businesses with us we for example may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with certain of these acquisitions or such cost savings within the expected time frame similarly the accretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisitions may not be realized or may be delayed integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business including thirdparty relationships or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies we also may fail to generate the expected revenue growth for the acquired business expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control unsuccessful clinical trials regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates including those acquired in these acquisitions 

spinoff and combination of upjohn with mylan 

we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the spinoff and combination the transactions of the upjohn business with mylan which resulted in the creation of viatris due to many factors including among others strategic adjustments required to reflect the nature of our business following the transactions increased risks resulting from us becoming a company that is a more focused innovative sciencebased biopharmaceutical products business and the possibility that we may not achieve our strategic objectives in addition we have agreed to provide certain transition services to viatris generally for an initial period of 24 months following the completion of the transactions with certain possibilities for extension these obligations under the transition services agreements may result in additional expenses and may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business 

consumer healthcare jv with gsk 

in 2019 we and gsk combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a jv that operates globally under the gsk consumer healthcare name although we have certain consent board representation and other governance rights we are a minority owner of the jv and do not control the jv its management or its policies as a result our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction depend upon gsk’s operation and management of the jv in addition the jv is subject to risks that are different than the risks associated with our business many of these risks are outside gsk’s or the jv’s control and could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the jv 

gsk has indicated that it intends to separate the jv as an independent company listed on the uk equity market until july 31 2024 gsk has the exclusive right to initiate a separation and listing transaction we have the option to participate in a separation and listing transaction initiated by gsk however the separation and public listing transaction may not be initiated or completed within expected time periods or at all and both the timing and success of any separation and public listing transaction as well as the value generated for us or our shareholders in any such transaction will be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such transaction any future distribution or sale of our stake in the jv will similarly be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such transaction our ability to complete any such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the size of our retained stake at the time the uncertainty relating to the separation and public listing transactions their implementation their timing and their yet to be determined effects on the jv’s business may subject us and the jv to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business and financial results 

general risks 

covid19 pandemic 

our business operations and financial condition and results have been and may continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic to varying degrees the pandemic has presented a number of risks and challenges for our business including among others impacts due to travel limitations and mobility restrictions manufacturing disruptions and delays supply chain interruptions including challenges related to reliance on thirdparty suppliers disruptions to pipeline development and clinical trials including difficulties or delays in enrollment of certain clinical trials and in access to needed supplies decreased product demand due to reduced numbers of inperson meetings with prescribers patient visits with physicians vaccinations and elective surgeries resulting in fewer new prescriptions or refills of existing prescriptions and reduced demand for products used in procedures further reduced product demand as a result of increased unemployment challenges presented by reallocating personnel and rd manufacturing and other resources to assist in responding to the pandemic costs associated with the covid19 pandemic including practices intended to reduce the risk of transmission increased supply chain costs and additional rd costs incurred in our efforts to develop a vaccine to help prevent covid19 and potential treatments for covid19 challenges related to our business development initiatives including potential delays or disruptions related to regulatory approvals interruptions or delays in the operations of regulatory authorities which may delay potential approval of new products we are developing potential label expansions for existing products and the launch of newlyapproved products challenges operating in a virtual work environment potential increased cyber incidents such as phishing social engineering and malware attacks challenges related to our intellectual property both domestically and internationally including in response to any pressure or legal or regulatory action that could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for licensing or agreeing not to enforce 



intellectual property rights related to our products including our vaccine to help prevent covid19 and potential treatments for covid19 challenges related to conducting oversight and monitoring of regulated activities in a remote or virtual environment and other challenges presented by disruptions to our normal operations in response to the pandemic as well as uncertainties regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and its impacts and government or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control the supply of medicines 

we also face risks and uncertainties related to our efforts to develop and commercialize a vaccine to help prevent covid19 and potential treatments for covid19 as well as challenges related to their manufacturing supply and distribution including among others uncertainties inherent in rd including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints commencement andor completion dates for clinical trials regulatory submission dates regulatory approval dates andor launch dates as well as risks associated with preclinical or clinical data including the in vitro and phase 3 data for the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine bnt162b2 including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical clinical or safety data the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results including the rate of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date in additional analyses of the phase 3 trial and additional studies or in larger more diverse populations upon commercialization the ability of bnt162b2 to prevent covid19 caused by emerging virus variants the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will lead to new information about efficacy safety or other developments including the risk of additional adverse reactions some of which may be serious the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments including during the peer reviewpublication process in the scientific community generally and by regulatory authorities whether and when additional data from the bnt162 mrna vaccine program or other programs will be published in scientific publications and if so when and with what modifications and interpretations whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies when other biologics license andor eua applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for bnt162b2 or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the bnt162 program and if obtained whether or when such eua or licenses will expire or terminate whether and when any applications that may be pending or filed for bnt162b2 or other vaccines that may result from the bnt162 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities which will depend on myriad factors including making a determination as to whether the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine’s efficacy and if approved whether it will be commercially successful regulatory decisions impacting labeling or marketing manufacturing processes safety andor other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of a vaccine including development of products or therapies by other companies disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners clinical trial sites or thirdparty suppliers including our relationship with biontech the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products the risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture or test any such products challenges related to our vaccine’s ultralow temperature formulation twodose schedule and attendant storage distribution and administration requirements including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by us the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our rd and manufacturing efforts risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide research funding for the bnt162 program or potential treatment for covid19 challenges and risks associated with the pace of our development programs the risk that we may not be able to maintain or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our vaccine or any potential approved treatment which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods as previously indicated whether and when additional supply agreements will be reached uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations pricing and access challenges for such products challenges related to public vaccine confidence or awareness trade restrictions and competitive developments 

further the covid19 pandemic and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic could precipitate or amplify the other risks that we identify in this risk factors section which could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and results 

we are continuing to monitor the latest developments regarding the covid19 pandemic and its effects on our business operations and financial condition and results and have made certain assumptions regarding the covid19 pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections including assumptions regarding the duration severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic as well as covid19 vaccine supply and contracts which remain dynamic despite careful tracking and planning we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments in particular we believe the ultimate impact on our business operations and financial condition and results will be affected by the speed and extent of the continued spread of the coronavirus globally the emergence of additional virus variants the duration of the pandemic new information regarding the severity and incidence of covid19 the safety efficacy and availability of vaccines and treatments for covid19 the rate at which the population becomes vaccinated against covid19 the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic and governmental or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control supply of medicines the pandemic may also affect our business operations or financial condition and results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks

references to operational variances pertain to periodoverperiod changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results 

our business and strategy 

most of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products with the formation of the consumer healthcare jv in 2019 and the completion of the spinoff and combination of our upjohn business with mylan in november 2020 pfizer has transformed into a more focused global leader in sciencebased innovative medicines and vaccines we now operate as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery development manufacturing marketing sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 the financial results of the upjohn business and the mylanjapan collaboration are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented priorperiod information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure following the separation of the upjohn business see note 1a and item 1 business––commercial operations of this form 10k for additional information we expect to incur costs of approximately 700 million in connection with separating upjohn of which approximately 70 has been incurred since inception and through december 31 2020 these charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs 

transforming to a more focused company we have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately with our revenue base while certain direct costs transferred to the consumer healthcare jv and to the upjohn business in connection with the spinoff there are indirect costs which did not transfer in addition we are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support and drive the purpose of our focused innovative biopharmaceutical products business and rd and pgs platform functions see the costs and expenses––restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and costreductionproductivity initiatives section of this mda

our operating environment 

we like other businesses in our industry are subject to certain industryspecific challenges these include among others the topics listed below see also the item 1 business––government regulation and price constraints section of this form 10k 

regulatory environment––pipeline productivity 

our product lines must be replenished to offset revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity respond to healthcare and innovation trends and provide for earnings growth as a result we devote considerable resources to our rd activities which while essential to our growth incorporate a high degree of risk and cost including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an inline product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially we conduct clinical trials to 



provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a drug’s overall benefitrisk profile for a particular patient population in addition after a product has been approved and launched we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients this includes postmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge for the entire life of the product we collect safety data and report safety information to the fda and other regulatory authorities regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety concerns and take regulatory actions in response such as updating a product’s labeling restricting its use communicating new safety information to the public or in rare cases requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the market the commercial potential of inline products may be negatively impacted by postmarketing developments 

intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights 

the loss expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of copromotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years for example the basic product patent for chantix in the us expired in november 2020 also the basic product patent for sutent in the us will expire in august 2021 while additional patent expiries will continue we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2021 through 2025 we continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access 

for additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole see the item 1 business––patents and other intellectual property rights section in this form 10k

regulatory environmentpricing and access––us healthcare legislation 



regulatory environmentpricing and access––government and other payer group pressures 

the pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare which includes medicines medical services and hospital services continues to be important to payers governments patients and other stakeholders federal and state governments and private thirdparty payers in the us continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement we consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines within the us we often engage with patients doctors and healthcare plans we also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers including pbms and mcos the price that patients pay in the us for prescribed medicines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers on average insurers impose a higher outofpocket burden on patients for prescription medicines than for comparably priced medical services certain governments outside the us provide healthcare at lowtozero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to effectively regulate prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system governments may use a variety of measures including proposing pricing reform or legislation cross country collaboration and procurement price cuts mandatory rebates health technology assessments forced localization as a condition of market access “international reference pricing” ie the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries qce processes and vbp for additional information see the item 1 business –– government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10k 

the global economic environment 

in addition to the industryspecific factors discussed above we like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities are exposed to the economic cycle certain factors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls global economic conditions restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as impacts of political or civil unrest terrorist activity unstable governments and legal systems intergovernmental disputes and public health outbreaks epidemics and pandemics government pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices access criteria or other means of cost control 

covid19 pandemic 

the continuation of the covid19 pandemic has impacted our business operations and financial condition and results for additional information on the impact of covid19 on our revenues please see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook–our 2020 performance section of this mda 

our response to covid19 

we are committed to confronting the public health challenge posed by the pandemic by collaborating with industry partners and academic institutions to develop potential approaches to prevent and treat covid19 in march 2020 we issued a fivepoint plan calling on the biopharmaceutical industry to join us in committing to unprecedented collaboration to combat covid19 subsequently we have made some important advances including among others 

• entry into a global agreement except for china hong kong macau and taiwan with biontech for the development manufacture and commercialization of an mrnabased coronavirus vaccine bnt162 to help prevent covid19 in november 2020 the companies announced that after conducting the final efficacy analysis in the phase 3 study bnt162b2 met both of the study’s primary efficacy endpoints 



analysis of the data indicated a vaccine efficacy rate against covid19 of 95 in participants without prior sarscov2 infection first primary objective and also in participants with and without prior sarscov2 infection second primary objective in each case measured from seven days after the second dose the fda authorized the distribution and use of bnt162b2 in the us to help prevent covid19 for individuals 16 years of age and older under an eua issued in december 2020 bnt162b2 has not been approved or licensed by the fda the eua authorizes distribution and use of this product subject to the conditions set forth in the eua and only for the duration of the declaration by the department of health  human services that circumstances exist justifying authorization of emergency use of drugs and biological products such as bnt162b2 during the covid19 pandemic under section 564 of the ffdca the declaration or until revocation of the eua by the fda the fda has issued euas to certain other companies for products intended for the prevention or treatment of covid19 and may continue to do so during the duration of the declaration the fda expects eua holders to work towards submission of a bla as soon as possible bnt162b2 has now been granted a cma eua or temporary authorization in more than 50 countries worldwide the companies continue to study bnt162b2 including studies evaluating it in additional populations booster doses and emerging variants based on the updated 6dose labeling and subject to continuous process improvements expansion at current facilities and adding new suppliers and contract manufacturers the companies believe that they can potentially manufacture at least 2 billion doses in total by the end of 2021 the companies have entered into agreements to supply prespecified doses of bnt162b2 with multiple developed and emerging nations around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of bnt162b2 to governments under such agreements as of february 2 2021 based on the doses to be delivered in 2021 primarily under agreements entered into as of february 2 2021 including among others agreements with the us government to supply 200 million doses the european commission to supply 300 million doses the japanese government to supply 144 million doses and covid19 vaccines global access covax for up to 40 million doses in 2021 subject to the negotiation and execution of additional agreements under the covax facility structure we forecasted approximately 15 billion in revenues in 2021 from bnt162b2 with gross margin to be split evenly with biontech this forecast was based on doses mostly covered under agreements entered into as of february 2 2021 and did not include all of the doses we can potentially deliver by the end of 2021 the companies continue to enter into agreements with governments for additional doses including among others the exercise by the us government of an option for an additional 100 million doses and an agreement with the european commission for an additional 200 million doses to be delivered in 2021 accordingly this forecast may change based in part on these and future additional agreements that may be signed and as circumstances warrant for additional information on our covid19 vaccine development program see note 2 and the item 1a risk factors—covid19 pandemic section in this form 10k 

• initiation in september 2020 of a phase 1b clinical trial in hospitalized participants with covid19 to evaluate the safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a novel investigational protease inhibitor for covid19 pf07304814 which is a phosphate prodrug of a 3clike 3cl protease inhibitor pf00835231 

despite our significant investments and efforts any of our ongoing development programs related to covid19 may not be successful as the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty these efforts will yield a successful product or that costs will ultimately be recouped 

impact of covid19 on our business and operations 

the following discussion summarizes our current views of key business and operational areas impacted by the pandemic and its effects on our business operations and financial condition and results as part of our ongoing monitoring and assessment we have made certain assumptions regarding the covid19 pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections including assumptions regarding the duration severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic as well as covid19 vaccine supply and contracts which remain dynamic despite careful tracking and planning we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments in particular we believe the ultimate impact on our business operations and financial condition and results will be affected by the speed and extent of the continued spread of the coronavirus globally the emergence of additional virus variants the duration of the pandemic new information regarding the severity and incidence of covid19 the safety efficacy and availability of vaccines and treatments for covid19 the rate at which the population becomes vaccinated against covid19 the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic and governmental or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control supply of medicines we are focused on all aspects of our business and are implementing measures aimed at mitigating issues where possible including by using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial manufacturing rd and enabling functions globally 

our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways for example 

• at this time most of our colleagues who are able to perform their job functions outside of our facilities continue to work remotely while certain colleagues in the pgs and wrdm organizations continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission 

• while engagement with healthcare professionals has started to return to prepandemic levels due to our virtual engagement capabilities our sales force colleagues continue to encounter mixed access as a result of ongoing restrictions on inperson meetings we are actively reviewing and assessing epidemiological data and our colleagues remain ready to resume inperson engagements with healthcare professionals on a locationbylocation basis as soon as it is safe to do so during the pandemic we have adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our existing digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide critical education and information including increasing the scale of our remote engagement 

• we have not seen a significant disruption to our supply chain to date and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels 

• after a brief pause to the recruitment portion of certain ongoing clinical studies and a delay to most new study starts we restarted recruitment across the development portfolio including new study starts in lateapril 2020 

• our portfolio of products experienced varying impacts from the pandemic some of our products are medically necessary but also more reliant on maintenance therapy with continuing patients in addition to new patients some of our products are more reliant on new patient starts and typically require doctor visits including wellness visits and some of our products are identified as medically necessary for treatment in the pandemic a large proportion of our portfolio comprises oral or selfinjected medicines that do not require a visit to an infusion center or a physician’s office for administration but vaccines and physicianadministered medicines which do require office visits were impacted in 2020 by covid19related mobility restrictions or limitations and decline in patient visits to doctors in addition certain of our vaccines such as prevnar 13prevenar 13 may be impacted by recommendations by certain health officials to not coadminister such vaccines alongside the covid19 vaccines for additional detail on the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our products see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income—revenues—selected product discussio n section within mda 



notwithstanding the foregoing impact of the pandemic given our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets access to capital markets and revolving credit agreements we believe we have and expect to maintain the ability to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we will continue to pursue efforts to maintain the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic future developments could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on our business operations or financial condition and results if we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chains or significant disruptions in clinical trials or other operations or if demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the covid19 pandemic we could experience a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition and results see the item 1a risk factors—covid19 pandemic section of this form 10k 

significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

following is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements also see note 1c  

for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 1  of these policies the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments acquisitions  note 1d  fair value  note 1e  revenues  note 1g  asset impairments  note 1l  tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies  note 1p  pension and postretirement benefit plans  note 1q  and legal and environmental contingencies  note 1r  

acquisitions and fair value 

for discussions about the application of fair value see the following recent acquisitions  note 2a  investments  note 7a  benefit plan assets  note 11d  and asset impairments below 

revenues 

our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized such variable consideration represents chargebacks rebates sales allowances and sales returns these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and as such knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period 

historically adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1 of revenues productspecific rebates however can have a significant impact on yearoveryear individual product revenue growth trends if any of our ratios factors assessments experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience our results could be materially affected the potential of our estimates to vary sensitivity differs by program product type of customer and geographic location however estimates associated with us medicare medicaid and performancebased contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate settlement an interval that can generally range up to one year because of this lag our recording of adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters 

asset impairments 

we review all of our longlived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year we perform impairment testing for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other longlived assets whenever impairment indicators are present when necessary we record charges for impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets our impairment review processes are described in note 1l 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include 

• a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset for example a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result in generic competition earlier than expected 

• a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the fda or other regulatory authorities that could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product 

• an expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset this could result for example from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability this also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that impacts projected revenue growth as well as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients physicians and payers for iprd projects this could result from among other things a change in outlook based on clinical trial data a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product 

identifiable intangible assets 

we use an income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset which incorporates the consideration of a terminal value for indefinitelived assets and then we apply an assetspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological advancements and risk associated with iprd assets as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic origin of the projected cash flows 

while all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment those that are most at risk of impairment include iprd assets approximately 32 billion as of december 31 2020 and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinitelived brand assets iprd assets are highrisk assets given the uncertain nature of rd newly acquired and recently impaired indefinitelived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or 



carrying value at the end of each reporting period as such immediately after acquisition or impairment even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment review work as of december 31 2020 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time 

in our review we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount qualitative factors that we consider include for example macroeconomic and industry conditions overall financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we then perform a quantitative fair value test 

when we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we mainly use the income approach but may also use the market approach or a weightedaverage combination of both approaches 

• the income approach is a forwardlooking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts within the income approach we use the discounted cash flow method we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the reporting unit which includes the application of a terminal value and then we apply a reporting unitspecific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal andor regulatory forces on the projections as well as the selection of a longterm growth rate the discount rate which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows and the tax rate which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows 

• the market approach is a historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information we may use two alternative methods within the market approach 

◦ guideline public company method—this method employs market multiples derived from market prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business and that are actively traded on a free and open market and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance 

◦ guideline transaction method—this method relies on pricing multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance 

the market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be a reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued however these assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies and transactions and the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in ownership percentages ownership rights business ownership forms or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline companies and transactions 

for all of our reporting units there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for a list of these factors see the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results and the item 1a risk factors sections in this form 10k 

benefit plans 

for a description of our different benefit plans see note 11  

effective january 1 2018 accruals for future benefits under the pcpp our largest us defined benefit plan and the defined benefit section of the pfizer group pension scheme our largest pension plan in the uk were frozen and resulted in elimination of future service costs for the plans the pfizer defined contribution savings plan provides additional annual contributions to those previously accruing benefits under the pcpp and active members of the pfizer group pension scheme started accruing benefits under the defined contribution section of that plan 

our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management the judgments made in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations 



a for detailed assumptions associated with our benefit plans see note 11b  



expected annual rate of return on plan assets 

the assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect our actual historical return experience and our longterm assessment of forwardlooking return expectations by asset classes which is used to develop a weightedaverage expected return based on the implementation of our targeted asset allocation in our respective plans 

the expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our us plans and the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each yearend and the resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year 



the actual return on plan assets was approximately 29 billion during 2020  

discount rate used to measure plan obligations 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our us defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated and modified as required to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aaaa or better that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled the discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least annually by reference to investment grade corporate bonds rated aaaa or better including when there is sufficient data a yieldcurve approach these discount rate determinations are made in consideration of local requirements 

the measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect the amount of service cost interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year 



the change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of december 31 2020 resulted in an increase in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately 19 billion 

anticipated change in accounting policy 

we anticipate making a change in our pension accounting policy under which we would begin recognizing actuarial gains and losses immediately in the income statement compared to our current accounting policy that recognizes such gains and losses in stockholders’ equity and amortizes them as a component of net periodic benefit costcredit over future periods this anticipated change is expected to go into effect in the first quarter of 2021 and if adopted will require recasting prior period amounts to conform to the new accounting policy

analysis of the consolidated statements of income 

revenues by geography 



2020 v 2019 



revenues for 2020 included an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately 700 million or 2 due to covid19 primarily reflecting lower demand for certain products in china and unfavorable disruptions to wellness visits for patients in the us which negatively impacted prescribing patterns for certain products partially offset by increased us demand for certain sterile injectable products and increased adult uptake for prevenar 13 in certain international markets resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses and us revenues for bnt162b2 

emerging markets revenues decreased 456 million or 5 in 2020 to 84 billion from 88 billion in 2019 and were relatively flat operationally reflecting an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 5 on emerging markets revenues the relatively flat operational performance was primarily driven by growth from eliquis prevenar 13 ibrance and zavicefta offset by lower revenues for consumer healthcare reflecting the july 31 2019 completion of the consumer healthcare jv transaction 



2019 v 2018 



emerging markets revenues increased 210 million or 2 in 2019 to 88 billion from 86 billion in 2018 reflecting an operational increase of 820 million or 10 foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 7 on emerging markets revenues the operational increase in emerging markets was primarily driven by prevenar 13 ibrance and eliquis 

revenue deductions 

our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized these deductions represent estimates of related obligations and as such knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period 

historically adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1 of revenues productspecific rebates however can have a significant impact on yearoveryear individual product revenue growth trends 



revenue deductions are primarily a function of product sales volume mix of products sold contractual or legislative discounts and rebates 

for information on our accruals for revenue deductions including the balance sheet classification of these accruals see note 1g

costs and expenses 

the changes in costs and expenses below reflect among other things a decline in expenses resulting from the july 31 2019 completion of the consumer healthcare jv transaction see note 2c  in addition the covid19 pandemic impacted certain operating expenses in 2020 





cost of sales 

2020 v 2019 

cost of sales increased 441 million primarily due to 

• increased sales volumes 

• the increase in royalty expenses due to an increase in sales of related products 

• the unfavorable impact of incremental costs incurred in response to the covid19 pandemic and 

• the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and hedging activity on intercompany inventory 

partially offset by 

• the favorable impact of the july 31 2019 completion of the consumer healthcare jv transaction 

the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to all of the factors discussed above partially offset by an increase in alliance revenues which have no associated cost of sales 

2019 v 2018 

cost of sales decreased 736 million primarily due to 

• the favorable impact of the july 31 2019 completion of the consumer healthcare jv transaction 

• the favorable impact of foreign exchange and 

• the favorable impact of hedging activity of intercompany inventory 

partially offset by 

• the unfavorable change in product mix and 

• the increase in royalty expenses due to an increase in sales of related products 

the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to all of the factors discussed above as well an increase in alliance revenues which have no associated cost of sales 

selling informational and administrative sia expenses 

2020 v 2019 

sia expenses decreased 11 billion mostly due to 

• the favorable impact of the july 31 2019 completion of the consumer healthcare jv transaction 

• lower spending for corporate enabling functions 

• lower spending on sales and marketing activities due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and 

• lower investments across the internal medicine and inflammation  immunology portfolios 

partially offset by 

• the increase in external incremental costs directly related to implementing our costreductionproductivity initiatives and 

• the increase in business and legal entity alignment costs 

2019 v 2018 

sia expenses increased 138 million primarily due to 

• additional investment in emerging markets 

• additional investment in the oncology portfolio in developed markets 

• increased employee deferred compensation as a result of savings plan gains 

• the increase due to the timing of expenses ie insurance recoveries and product donations 

• marketing and promotional expenses for the us launches of vyndaqel in may 2019 and vyndamax in september 2019 



• increased business and legal entity alignment costs 

• costs to separate consumer healthcare and 

• increased healthcare reform expenses 

partially offset by 

• the favorable impact of the july 31 2019 completion of the consumer healthcare jv and 

• the favorable impact of foreign exchange 

research and development rd expenses 

2020 v 2019 

rd expenses increased 10 billion mainly due to 

• costs related to our collaboration agreement with biontech to codevelop a covid19 vaccine including an upfront payment to biontech 

• a net increase in upfront payments mainly related to myovant and valneva and 

• increased investments towards building new capabilities and driving automation 

partially offset by 

• the net reduction of upfront and milestone payments associated with the acquisition of therachon in july 2019 and akcea in october 2019 

2019 v 2018 

rd expenses increased 635 million mainly due to 

• upfront payments to therachon and akcea 

• increased investments towards building new capabilities and driving automation 

• increased spending on our inflammation  immunology and rare disease portfolios due to several phase 3 programs and 

investment in gene therapy 

• increased spending related to assets acquired from our acquisition of array and 

• increased medical spend for new and growing products 

partially offset by 

• decreased spending across the oncology vaccines and internal medicine portfolios as select programs have reached completion 

• the decrease in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting changes in the price of pfizer’s common stock as well as management’s assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved 

• the discontinuation of the staphylococcus aureus vaccine trial 

• the favorable impact of the july 31 2019 completion of the consumer healthcare jv and 

• the favorable impact of foreign exchange 

amortization of intangible assets 

2020 v 2019 

amortization of intangible assets decreased 10 billion primarily due to 

• the nonrecurrence of amortization of fully amortized assets and the impairment of eucrisa in the fourth quarter of 2019 

partially offset by 

• the increase in amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition of array 

2019 v 2018 

amortization of intangible assets decreased 274 million mainly due to 

• the nonrecurrence of amortization as a result of the impairment of sterile injectable products in the fourth quarter of 2018 

• fully amortized assets and

restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and costreductionproductivity initiatives 

transforming to a more focused company program 

for a description of our program as well as the anticipated and actual costs see note 3 the program savings discussed below may be rounded and represent approximations in connection with the costs primarily related to the corporate enabling functions initiatives we expect gross cost savings of 10 billion or net cost savings excluding merit and inflation growth and certain real estate cost increases of 700 million to be achieved primarily over the twoyear period 20212022 in connection with manufacturing network optimization including legacy cost reduction initiatives we expect targeted net cost savings of 300 million to be achieved primarily from 2020 through 2022 



certain qualifying costs for this program were recorded in 2020 and in the fourth quarter of 2019 and are reflected as certain significant items and excluded from our nongaap measure of adjusted income see the nongaap financial measure adjusted income section of this mda 

in addition to this program we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction andor productivity opportunities especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products 

other incomedeductions––net 

2020 v 2019 

other deductions—net decreased 26 billion mainly due to 

• lower asset impairment charges 

• higher net periodic benefit credits other than service costs

• higher consumer healthcare jv equity method income and 

• lower charges for certain legal matters 

partially offset by 

• higher net losses on asset disposals 

2019 v 2018 

other deductions—net increased 12 billion mainly due to 

• higher net periodic benefits costs other than service costs 

• lower income from collaborations outlicensing arrangements and sales of compoundproduct rights 

• higher interest expense mainly as a result of an increased commercial paper balance due to the acquisition of array as well as the retirement of lowercoupon debt and the issuance of new debt with a higher coupon than the debt outstanding for the comparative prior year period and

nongaap financial measure adjusted income 

adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance in conjunction with other performance measures as such we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure we use adjusted income certain components of adjusted income and adjusted diluted eps to present the results of our major operations––the discovery development manufacture marketing sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide––prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows 





a most directly comparable gaap measure 

b the shortterm incentive plans for substantially all nonsalesforce employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance measured in significant part by three metrics one of which is adjusted diluted eps which is derived from adjusted income and accounts for 40 of the bonus pool funding additionally the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by adjusted net income which is derived from adjusted income effective for the 2020 performance year and consistent with shareholder feedback received in 2019 the compensation committee of the bod approved adding an rd pipeline achievement factor to the existing shortterm incentive financial metrics 

adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted eps are nongaap financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore are limited in their usefulness to investors because of their nonstandardized definitions they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance a limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers these measures are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for their directly comparable gaap measures of net income attributable to pfizer inc common shareholders  components of net income attributable to pfizer inc common shareholders and eps attributable to pfizer inc common shareholders—diluted  respectively see the accompanying reconciliations of certain gaap reported to nongaap adjusted information for 2020 2019 and 2018 below 

we also recognize that as internal measures of performance these measures have limitations and we do not restrict our performancemanagement process solely to these measures we also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance for example our rd organization has productivity targets upon which its effectiveness is measured in addition total shareholder return both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans 

purchase accounting adjustments 

adjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions these impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finitelived intangible assets and to a much lesser extent depreciation related to the increasedecrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt and the fair value changes for contingent consideration therefore the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products 

the exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which rd costs have been expensed however we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own such as different rd costs timelines or resulting sales accordingly this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets internally 

acquisitionrelated costs 

adjusted income excludes acquisitionrelated costs which are comprised of transaction integration restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition we have made no adjustments for resulting synergies 

the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities for this reason we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other more normal business contexts the integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy 

discontinued operations 

adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods but are presented for consistency across all periods 

certain significant items 

adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive andor unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict furthermore in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods for example although major nonacquisitionrelated costreduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business cost productivity or in response to loe or economic conditions legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases which are facts and circumstances specific and in some cases may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business items that either as a result of their nature or size we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis items that would be nonrecurring or items that relate to products we no longer sell for a noninclusive list of certain significant items see details of income statement items included in gaap reported but excluded from nongaap adjusted income below

a for details of adjustments see details of income statement items included in gaap reported but excluded from nongaap adjusted income  

b the effective tax rate on nongaap adjusted income was 135 in 2020 158 in 2019 and 180 in 2018 the decrease in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business the decrease in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily due to a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits for the resolution of certain tax positions principally nonus pertaining to prior years

analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations 



cash flows from discontinued operations 

cash flows from discontinued operations relate to the upjohn business see note 2b  in 2020 net cash provided by financing activities from discontinued operations primarily reflects issuances of longterm debt  



analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resources and market risk 

we rely largely on operating cash flows shortterm investments or commercial paper borrowings and longterm debt to provide for our liquidity requirements we continue our efforts to improve cash inflows through working capital efficiencies we target specific areas of focus including accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and other working capital which allows us to optimize our operating cash flows 

due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future which can include among others 

• the working capital requirements of our operations including our rd activities 

• investments in our business 

• dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate 

• share repurchases 

• the cash requirements for our costreductionproductivity initiatives 

• paying down outstanding debt 

• contributions to our pension and postretirement plans and 

• business development activities 

our longterm debt is rated highquality by both sp and moody’s see the credit ratings section below we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments and monitoring of our liquidity position in response to market changes our debt investments consist primarily of highquality highly liquid welldiversified availableforsale debt securities 

debt capacity—lines of credit 

we have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries we typically maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and shortterm investments which together with our available revolving credit facilities are in excess of our commercial paper and other shortterm borrowings see note 7c  

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 



a see note 7 for a description of certain assets held and for a description of credit risk related to our financial instruments held 

b the increase in working capital was primarily driven by the use of upjohn cash distribution proceeds to pay down shortterm commercial paper borrowings see note 2b

credit ratings 

two major corporate debtrating organizations moody’s and sp assign ratings to our shortterm and longterm debt a security rating is not 

a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each 

rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 



both moody’s and sp lowered pfizer’s longterm debt rating one notch to ‘a2’ and ‘a’ respectively upon completion of the upjohn separation in november 2020 pfizer’s shortterm rating remained unchanged additionally both rating agencies removed pfizer’s longterm debt rating from “under review” and assigned a stable outlook 

libor 

for information on interest rate risk and libor see the item 1a risk factors––global operations section in this form 10k we do not expect the transition to an alternative rate to have a material impact on our liquidity or financial resources 

gl o bal economic conditions 

our venezuela and argentina operations function in hyperinflationary economies the impact to pfizer is not considered material for additional information on the global economic environment see the item 1a risk factors––global operations section in this form 10k 

market risk 

the objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements on our earnings we address these exposures through a combination of operational means and financial instruments we adapt our practices periodically as economic conditions change for more information see notes 1f and 7e  as well as the item 1a risk factors—global operations section in this form 10k for key currencies in which we operate 

foreign exchange risk —we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and our net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

on the commercial side a significant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in exchange rates where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures we may use foreign currency forwardexchange contracts andor foreign currency swaps to manage that risk 

with respect to our financial assets and liabilities our primary foreign exchange exposure arises from intercompany receivables and payables and to a lesser extent from investments and debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business entity 

in addition under certain market conditions we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities in these cases we may use foreign exchange contracts andor foreign currency debt 

the fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this analysis holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not have any effect on another currency’s rates relative to the us dollar if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 as of december 31 2020 the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant 

interest rate risk —our interestbearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk which may have an impact on net income depending on market conditions we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates 

the fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes in this analysis holding all other assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2020 the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant 

equity price risk ––we hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions while we are holding such securities we are subject to equity price risk and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments from time to time we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations which may include limiting our price risk 

our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes in this sensitivity analysis the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant 



contractual obligations 

payments due under contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 mature as follows 



a see note 7  

b see notes 3  7a  11e and 16  

c see note 15  

d also includes obligations to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over the next six years in connection with the us and eu approvals for besponsa 401 million and an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over the next seven years for bosulif 195 million both associated with rd arrangements 

e see note 5 

the above table includes amounts for potential milestone payments under collaboration licensing or other arrangements if the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development regulatory andor commercialization milestones which may span several years and which may never occur 

in 2021 we expect to spend approximately 30 billion on property plant and equipment we rely largely on operating cash flows to fund our capital investment needs 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities for more information on guarantees and indemnifications see note 16b  

additionally certain of our copromotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions copromotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products 

sharepurchase plans and accelerated share repurchase agreements 

see note 12 for information on the shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced sharepurchase plans including our accelerated share repurchase agreements at december 31 2020 our remaining sharepurchase authorization was approximately 53 billion 



dividends on common stock 

in december 2020 our bod declared a firstquarter dividend of 039 per share payable on march 5 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 29 2021 the firstquarter 2021 cash dividend will be our 329th consecutive quarterly dividend 

our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants while the dividend level remains a decision of pfizer’s bod and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases barring significant unforeseen events viatris is expected to begin paying a quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2021 at which time pfizer’s quarterly dividend is expected to be reduced such that the combined dividend dollar amount received by pfizer shareholders based upon the combination of continued pfizer ownership and approximately 0124079 shares of viatris common stock which were granted for each pfizer share in the spinoff will equate to pfizer’s dividend amount in effect immediately prior to the initiation of the viatris dividend

collaboration and copromotion agreements 

we are party to collaboration andor copromotion agreements relating to certain biopharmaceutical products including among others eliquis xtandi and bavencio revenues from eliquis except in certain markets where we have direct sales  xtandi and bavencio are included in alliance revenues 

eliquis has been jointly developed and is commercialized by pfizer and bms pfizer funds between 50 and 60 of all development costs depending on the study profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis except in certain countries where pfizer commercializes eliquis and pays bms compensation based on a percentage of net sales we have full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets bms supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to endcustomers in these markets eliquis is part of the novel oral anticoagulant market the agents in this class were developed as alternative treatment options to warfarin in appropriate patients 

xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with astellas the two companies share equally in the gross profits losses related to us net sales of xtandi subject to certain exceptions pfizer and astellas also share equally all xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the us market in addition pfizer and astellas share certain development and other collaboration expenses and pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international xtandi net sales recorded in other incomedeductions––net  xtandi is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells 

bavencio avelumab is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with merck kgaa both companies jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs and split equally any profits related to net sales generated from selling any products containing avelumab from this collaboration bavencio is a human antiprogrammed death ligand1 pdl1 antibody 



research and development 

innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development are timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable pfizer’s purpose is to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives rd is at the heart of fulfilling pfizer’s purpose as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that matter most 

our rd priorities and strategy 

our rd priorities include 

 

to that end our rd primarily focuses on 

 

while a significant portion of rd is done internally we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines we do so by entering into collaboration alliance and license agreements with other companies as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity or debtbased investments these agreements enable us to codevelop license or acquire promising compounds technologies andor capabilities we also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of the development costs of one or more of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments revenue sharing payments profit sharing payments andor royalties collaboration alliance license and funding agreements and equity or debtbased investments allow us to share risk and cost they also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and inlicensed or acquired products 

for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 2  acquisitions divestitures equitymethod investments and assets and liabilities held for sale licensing arrangements and research and development and collaborative arrangements in our 2019 financial report 

our rd operations 

we conduct rd internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms in 2019 we continued to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time 

our rd spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations 





 we manage rd operations on a totalcompany basis through our matrix organizations described above specifically the portfolio strategy  investment committee comprised of senior executives is accountable for aligning resources among all of our wrdm gpd and biopharma rd projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative rd portfolio we believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility our upjohn rd organization manages its resources separately from the wrdm and gpd organizations with operational support from gpd for select clinical development regulatory activities and from wrdm for clinical supply operations and global pharmacovigilance processing 

generally we do not disaggregate total rd expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since as described above we do not manage our rd operations by development phase or by therapeutic area further as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly we believe that any priorperiod information about rd expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending 

for additional information on our rd operations and expenses see the costs and expenses — research and development rd expenses section in our 2019 financial report 

our rd pipeline and competition 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development the process from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years 

as of january 28 2020  we had the following number of projects in various stages of rd 

development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs while these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products in addition to discovering and developing new products our rd efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — product developments––biopharmaceutical section in our 2019 financial report which is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to rd we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence in addition several of our competitors operate without large rd expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration for additional information see the competition and item 1a risk factors — competitive products sections in this 2019 form 10k 



international operations 

we have significant operations outside the us in 2019 operations in developed and emerging markets were managed through our business segments biopharma upjohn and through july 31 2019 consumer healthcare emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastestgrowing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets particularly in asia provide growth opportunities for our medicines 

we sell our products in over 125 countries revenues from operations outside the us of 279 billion accounted for 54 of our total revenues in 2019  revenues exceeded 500 million in each of eleven countries outside the us in 2019 2018 and 2017 by total revenues china and japan are our two largest national markets outside the us for a geographic breakdown of revenues see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview and — revenues by operating segment and geography sections and the table captioned geographic information in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 segment geographic and other revenue information in our 2019 financial report 

our international operations are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries including among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations and expropriation and other restrictive government actions see the item 1a risk factors — international operations section in this 2019 form 10k our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws and regulations on pricing reimbursement and access to our products see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states section in this 2019 form 10k for a discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments depending upon market conditions for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7 f  financial instruments  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2019 financial report which is incorporated by reference as well as item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — financial risk management section in this 2019 form 10k 

marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical businesses we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants and pharmacists mcos that provide insurance coverage such as hospitals integrated delivery systems pbms and health plans and employers and government agencies who hire mcos to provide health benefits to their employees we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies and in the case of our vaccines products in the us we primarily sell directly to the us centers for disease control and prevention wholesalers individual provider offices retail pharmacies and integrated delivery networks we seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and pbm formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the pbms pbms use various benefit designs such as tiered copays for formulary 



products to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions we may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and physicians on key disease areas 

in 2019  our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 37 of our total revenues and approximately 79 of our total us revenues 

 of 2019 total revenues and us revenues from 

major biopharmaceutical wholesalers and other customers 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance to pfizer trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country further patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product for additional information see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states — intellectual property section in this 2019 form 10k 

in various markets a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided to certain drugs upon approval the scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but in general the period of regulatory exclusivity will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic product patent expires including where applicable grant of an additional sixmonth pediatric extension andor the granted patent term extension in the us and japan and supplementary patent certificate in europe are those for the medicines set forth in the table below unless otherwise indicated the years set forth in the table below pertain to the basic product patent expiration for the respective products patent term extensions supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below unless they have been granted by the issuing authority in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions to methods of manufacturing or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect our drug from generic or as applicable biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent 





 

the loss expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of copromotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues many of our branded products have multiple patents that expire at varying dates thereby strengthening our overall patent protection however once patent protection has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge we typically lose exclusivity on these products and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similar products and sell them for a lower price the date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however when generic or biosimilar competition does commence the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products often in a very short period of time in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms or conversion of the active ingredient to otc products 

also if one of our patents is found to be invalid by judicial court or administrative proceedings such as inter partes review postgrant review reexamination or opposition proceedings before the us patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterparts generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products for example several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and postgrant review proceedings in the us for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — patent protection section in this 2019 form 10k 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim either do not infringe our patents or our patents are invalid these include candidates that would compete with among other products eliquis ibrance and xeljanz we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights whenever we deem appropriate for additional

recent losses and expected losses of product exclusivity 

certain of our current products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years for example as a result of a patent litigation settlement teva launched a generic version of viagra in the us in december 2017 lyrica lost patent protection in the us in june 2019 and multisource generic competition began in july 2019 also the basic product patent for chantix in the us will expire in november 2020 see the table above for the basic product patent expiries of our most significant products 

we expect the impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries will be significant in 2020 then moderating downward to a much lower level from 2021 through 2025 for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products section in this 2019 form 10k 

the following table provides information about certain products recently experiencing or expected to experience in 2020  patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the us europe or japan our financial results in 2019 and our financial guidance for 2020 reflect the impact of the loss of exclusivity of various products discussed below 



 

biologic products 

our biologic products including benefix refacto xyntha bavencio prevnar 13prevenar 13 and enbrel we market enbrel outside the us and canada already face or may face in the future competition from biosimilars also referred to as followon biologics in the us such biosimilars would reference our originator biologic products approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a followon recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin that was approved under the ffdca 

biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety purity or potency biosimilars have the potential to offer highquality lowercost alternatives to biologic medicines abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca in 2010 a framework for such approval exists in the us in europe the european commission grants marketing authorizations for biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals 

as part of our business strategy we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths to develop and commercialize biosimilar medicines some of the biosimilars that we currently market include inflectra nivestym retacrit zirabev ruxience and trazimera in the us inflectra retacrit nivestim and trazimera in the eu and ixifi trazimera zirabev and ruxience in japan see the item 1a risk factors — biosimilars section in this 2019 form 10k 



we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biologic products likewise as we develop manufacture and seek to launch biosimilars patents may be asserted against us 

international 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years we have seen some improvement in global protection of intellectual property rights for additional information see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states — intellectual property section in this 2019 form 10k 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased biopharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products 

this competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in rd as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further demonstrating the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians payers and global health authorities we also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs we believe that we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of alternative vaccines for example prevnar 13 may face competition in the form of competitor vaccines including vaccines with additional serotypes or “nextgeneration” pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to or after the expiration of its patents which may adversely affect our future results 

our generics and biosimilars businesses compete with branded products from competitors as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers globally pfizer sells generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain competitors’ solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products we also sell biosimilars of certain inflammation  immunology and oncology biologic medicines globally we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “firsttomarket” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars as a “firsttomarket” position provides customers a lowercost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with potentially higher levels of sales and profitability until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market 

managed care organizations 

the evolution of managed care in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 300 million people in the us now have some form of health insurance coverage due to the expansion of health insurance coverage see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — in the united states section in this 2019 form 10k the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the us continues to grow in importance 

the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate as well as their importance to pfizer 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures mcos typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using 



formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine volume purchasing longterm contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs in addition by placing branded medicines on highertier status in their formularies leading to higher patient copays or nonpreferred tier status mcos transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient resulting in significant outofpocket expenses for the patient especially for chronic treatments this financial disincentive is a tool for mcos to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the mcos mcos also use additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing and “copay accumulator” programs to improve their cost containment efforts we are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them 

due to their generally lower cost generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of mco formularies the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population and beyond consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies however increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a nonpreferred status 

mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

the aca has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes for additional information see the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — in the united states—healthcare reform section in this 2019 form 10k 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time several competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration generic competitors often operate without large rd expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less in china for example we are expected to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2020 which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute for brandname drugs generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs in a small subset of states prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution favoring generics may reduce sales of our branded products 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources in 2019  we experienced periodic shortages of select materials due to constrained capacity or operational challenges with the associated suppliers supplier management activities are ongoing to work to ensure the necessary supply to meet our requirements for these materials no significant impact to our operations is anticipated in 2020 



government regulation and price constraints 

pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business certain laws and regulations that govern pfizer’s business are discussed below 

general  our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our products could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmental bodies for additional information on these proceedings and actions see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 16 a  contingencies and certain commitments — legal proceedings in our 2019 financial report criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties warning letters and product recalls or seizures delays in product approvals as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions could result from such proceedings and actions 

in the united states 

drug regulation  in the us biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre and postmarket regulation by the fda including regulations that govern among other things the safety and efficacy of our medicines clinical trials advertising and promotion manufacturing labeling and record keeping our products are also subject to postmarket surveillance under the ffdca and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs as well as the public health service act and its implementing regulations with respect to biologics 

other us federal agencies including the dea also regulate certain of our products many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec 

biopharmaceutical companies seeking to market a product in the us must first test the product to demonstrate that it is safe and effective for its intended use if after evaluation the fda determines the product is safe ie its benefits outweigh its known risks and effective then the fda will approve the product for marketing issuing a new drug application or biologics license application as appropriate companies seeking to market a generic prescription drug must scientifically demonstrate that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug the abbreviated new drug application or generic drug application must show among other things that the generic drug is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand the manufacturer is capable of making the drug correctly and the proposed label is the same as that of the innovatorbrand drug’s label 

even after a drug or biologic is approved for marketing it may still be subject to postmarketing commitments or postmarketing requirements postmarketing commitments are studies or clinical trials that the drug or biologic sponsor has agreed to conduct but are not required by law andor regulation postmarketing requirements include studies and clinical trials that sponsors are required to conduct by law andor regulation as a condition of approval postmarketing studies or clinical trials can be required in order to assess a known risk or demonstrate clinical benefit for drugs or biologics approved pursuant to accelerated approval if a company fails to meet its postmarketing requirements the fda may assess a civil monetary penalty issue a warning letter or deem the drug or biologic misbranded once a drug or biologic is approved the fda must be notified of any modifications to the product and the fda may also require a manufacturer to submit additional studies or conduct clinical trials in addition we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cgmps as well as advertising and promotion regulations failure to comply with the ffdca may subject us to administrative andor judicial sanctions including warning letters product recalls seizures delays in product approvals injunctions fines civil penalties andor criminal prosecution 

biosimilar regulation the aca created a framework for the approval of biosimilars also known as followon biologics following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic 

the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars through fda approvals and the issuance of draft and final guidance the fda has addressed a number of issues related to the biosimilars approval pathway such as the labeling expectations for biosimilars for example in 2019 the fda issued final guidance regarding the standards for demonstrating interchangeability with a uslicensed reference product in addition in 2017 the biosimilar user fee act was reauthorized for a fiveyear period which led to a significant increase in the fda’s biosimilar user fee revenues thereby providing the fda with additional resources to process biosimilar applications for example since the enactment of the newly authorized fee structure the fda estimates its revenues from biosimilar user fees generally will exceed 40 million 

sales and marketing laws and regulations  the marketing practices of us biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended among other things to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and to protect the integrity of government healthcare programs these laws include antikickback laws and false claims laws antikickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company from soliciting offering receiving or paying anything of value to generate business including purchasing or prescribing of a particular product false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented any claims for payment for goods including drugs or biologics or services to thirdparty payers including medicare and medicaid that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions andor exclusion from federal healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid the federal government 



and various states also have enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies the laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers require disclosure to the federal or state government and the public of such interactions andor require the adoption of compliance standards or programs many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations 

pricing and reimbursement  pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program the 340b drug pricing program and the medicare part d program pfizer must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program and medicare part b the calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose pfizer to penalties see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview section and the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1 g  basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  revenues and trade accounts receivable in our 2019 financial report which are incorporated by reference 

government and private thirdparty payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products including proposed action on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented there continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and measures to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals are being considered by congress the presidential administration and select states for example recent legislation revised how manufacturers calculate the average manufacturer price on branded drugs with authorized generics under the medicaid drug rebate program which the congressional budget office has estimated will reduce medicaid costs by over 3 billion over the next decade proposals for even more farreaching reform such as immediately eliminating or phasing out private health insurance are being proposed by some democratic candidates for us president in particular several states have enacted or are considering transparency laws that require prescription drug manufacturers to report to the state and make public price increases and sometimes to provide a written justification for the increase in addition to new state transparency laws and the introduction of several federal pricing bills we have also seen the presidential administration introduce proposals related to importation and express interest in international reference pricing in medicare part b we expect to see continued focus in regulating pricing resulting in additional legislation and regulation that could adversely impact revenue in addition us government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — us entitlement reform section in this 2019 form 10k also the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under medicaid restrictions exist for some pfizer products under certain state medicaid programs as another example access to our products under the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans with which state medicaid agencies contract to provide services to medicaid beneficiaries states continue to explore options for controlling healthcare costs related to medicaid and other state healthcare programs including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under the medicaid drug rebate program that are tied to patient outcomes in addition we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains and wholesalers who collectively are the primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products in the us and pbms will increase pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers including us for additional information see the item 1a risk factors — managed care trends section in this 2019 form 10k 

the potential for additional pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continues to be significant many employers have adopted high deductible health plans which can increase outofpocket costs for medicines this is a trend that is likely to continue private thirdparty payers such as health plans increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing which could result in lower prices lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets healthcare provider purchasers directly or through group purchasing organizations are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes 

overall there is increasing pressure on us providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes longer term we are seeing a shift in focus away from feeforservice payments towards outcomesbased payments and risksharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes these new payment models can at times lead to lower prices for and restricted access to new medicines at the same time these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions 

we believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes lower costs to the healthcare system and ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system in addition in response to the evolving us and global healthcare spending landscape we work with health authorities health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major us payers throughout the productdevelopment process to better 



understand how these entities value our compounds and products further we seek to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop register and manufacture by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs  

healthcare reform there have been significant efforts at the federal and state levels to reform the healthcare system by enhancing access to healthcare improving the delivery of healthcare and further rationalizing payment for healthcare we face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca there is additional uncertainty given the ruling in december 2019 by the us circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit in texas v azar that the individual mandate which is a significant provision of the aca is unconstitutional the case has been remanded to a lower court to determine whether the individual mandate is inseparable from the entire aca in which case the aca as a whole would be rendered unconstitutional in the meantime the remaining provisions of the law remain in effect the revenues generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion under the aca are not material so the impact of full invalidation of the law is expected to be limited however any future replacement for the aca may adversely affect our business and financial results particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employersponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increases industry taxes and fees any future healthcare reform efforts may adversely affect our business and financial results 

anticorruption the fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations 

data privacy pfizer collects personal data as part of its regular business activities the collection and use of this data is subject to privacy and data security laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies for example we are subject to the california consumer privacy act ccpa the ccpa which came into effect on january 1 2020 imposes numerous obligations on us including a duty to disclose the categories of personal data that we collect sell or share about california consumers and gives those consumers rights regarding their personal data noncompliance with any of these laws could result in the imposition of fines penalties or orders to stop noncompliant activities and could damage our reputation and harm our business 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most countries outside the us 

new drug approvals in the eu the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the mutual recognition procedure the decentralized procedure or the eu centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the european economic area countries norway iceland and liechtenstein the centralized procedure managed by the ema results in one single authorization for the whole eu which provides the most rapid and efficient means of gaining approval across the eu and is the one most commonly used for new products 

in china the regulatory system historically presented numerous challenges for the pharmaceutical industry as its requirements for drug development and registration were often inconsistent with us or other international standards in recent years however china has introduced reforms and draft reforms which are discussed in more detail below that attempt to address these challenges furthermore in 2017 the china regulatory authority the national medical products administration nmpa became a member of the international council for harmonization ich which has resulted in greater adoption of international technical guidelines and practices by the government 2019 was another active year in this respect with a number of reforms coming into effect and more proposals and drafts being issued for consultation 

in japan the pmda is the point of entry for businesses looking to sell drugs in the country the pmda which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities including clinical studies approvals postmarketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety must approve an application before a new drug product may be marketed in japan the pmda also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals 

health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority ie similar to the authority of the fda or the ema before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval 

pharmacovigilance in the eu the ema’s pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the eu authorities eu regulators may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization safety and efficacy studies at the time of approval or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products outside developed markets such as the eu and japan pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive but there is a trend toward increasing regulation 



pricing and reimbursement  certain governments including the different eu member states the uk china japan canada south korea and some other international markets provide healthcare at lowtozero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global financing pressures governments may use a variety of costcontainment measures for our pharmaceutical products including price cuts mandatory rebates health technology assessments forced localization as a condition of market access “international reference pricing” ie the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries quality consistency evaluation processes and volumebased procurement in addition the international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

in particular international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation price variations exacerbated by international reference pricing systems also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries 

in addition several important multilateral organizations such as the united nations including the world health organization who and the organization for economic cooperation and development are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations in 2019 the who continued exerting pressure on pharmaceutical pricing practices by supporting strategies to reduce medicine prices including calling for greater transparency around the cost of research and development and production of medicines as well as disclosure of net prices 

in japan the pricing environment for innovative medicines further deteriorated in 2019 with the introduction of a health technology assessment hta system to inform price adjustments of healthcare technologies after launch expansion of this system for reimbursement decisions as seen in other hta markets remains a risk while significant challenges remain the 2020 drug pricing reform package unlike the last reform package in 2018 is not expected to fundamentally change the access landscape furthermore the eligibility criteria for the price maintenance premium a key policy that protects against price erosion for certain products is expected to be somewhat enhanced while expedited regulatory pathways are codified in law 

in canada the patented medicine prices review board pmprb released draft guidelines to implement new pricing regulations in november 2019 which will go into force in july 2020 these regulations drop the us from the reference basket of countries used to determine price and add economic factors for setting ceiling prices for new medicines an initial analysis of the potential impact of these proposed changes to the pmprb regulations estimated an approximately 26 billion reduction in industry revenues over the next decade 

china pricing pressures  in china healthcare is largely driven by a public payer system with public medical insurance as the largest single payer for pharmaceuticals and pricing pressures have increased in recent years government officials have consistently emphasized the importance of improved health outcomes the need for healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards reform while the government provides basic health insurance for the vast majority of chinese citizens that insurance is not adequate to cover many innovative medicines and alternative funding sources for innovative medicines remain suboptimal 

in 2019 china’s government negotiated with companies to add approximately 90 innovative drugs mainly oncology medicines to the national reimbursement drug list this builds on 60 drugs already added through negotiation in 2017 and 2018 prices for drugs have been reduced dramatically through this governmentled process while these negotiations have included a path to access for companies market access is not assured in addition significant questions about the processes and negotiations for provincial tendering remain as well as the need for multilayered negotiations across provincial municipal and hospital levels 

in the offpatent space in 2013 china began to implement a quality consistency evaluation qce process in order to improve the quality of domesticallymanufactured generic drugs primarily by requiring such drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug typically the originator drug in 2018 numerous local generics were officially deemed bioequivalent under qce a pilot project for centralized volumebased procurement vbp was then initiated including 25 molecules of drugs covering 11 major chinese cities under this procurement model a tender process has been established where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners the program is intended to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed qce which has resulted in dramatic price cuts for offpatent medicines 

upjohn and most offpatent originators were not successful in the first bidding process under this pilot which was finalized in december 2018 and implemented in march 2019 and most contracts went to local generic companies the first bidding process resulted in significant price cuts by the successful bidders with some bidders reducing the price of their products by as much as 96 percent as companies attempted to secure volumes on the chinese pharmaceutical market the drugs that lost the bidding were also requested to reduce their selling price up to 30 percent based on the price difference with the successful bidder china’s government began nationwide expansion of the vbp pilot in december 2019 the expanded model which is being implemented nationwide applies to certain drugs that are purchased for public hospitals as well as some military and private medical institutions as in the first bidding process our upjohn business unit and most originator brands were not successful in 



the bidding process for this nationwide expansion and those contracts mostly went to local chinese generic companies the qcequalified generic makers of atorvastatin and amlodipine bid aggressively lowering prices even further from the march 2019 tender our upjohn business unit continues to take steps to mitigate the revenue impact of these initiatives but anticipates that they will continue to affect our upjohn business in china in the future we expect to utilize our presence in the retail channel private hospitals and tendering capabilities to mitigate some of these pricing pressures in addition we believe that our geographic expansion to underpenetrated and lowertiered cities and counties and additional focus on nontendered products will increase sales volumes in greater china and partially mitigate pressures from qce 

in late 2019 china announced another round of expansion of the national vbp program which covers 33 new molecules including biopharma’s zithromax tablets and diflucan tablets and no upjohn products biopharma was not successful in the bidding process for this expansion 

furthermore the chinese government has discussed moving toward efforts to unify the reimbursement price between qceapproved generic medicines and the applicable original medicines the government currently plans to implement this universal reimbursement price initiative within the next two to three years if this policy is implemented the new reimbursement level for upjohn’s products will likely be lower than the current reimbursement level placing additional pressures on price andor patient copays there remains uncertainty as to whether when and how this policy may be officially implemented the chinese government could also enact other policies that may increase pricing pressures or have the effect of reducing the volume of sales available to upjohn’s products this potential policy and any other policies like it that could increase pricing and copay pressures on upjohn’s drug products in china could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the government has indicated that additional postloe drugs could be subjected to qce qualification in future rounds which could also be tied to volumebased procurement the scope of future qce products and timing of any program expansion is currently unknown making it difficult to determine the impact on pfizer’s business and financial condition we will continue to monitor the market for developments 

eu regulatory changes  the eu adopted a new clinical trials regulation in may 2014 but its implementation has been delayed by the need for the eu authorities to establish new technical systems this regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the administrative processes and governance of clinical trials in the eu and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results it is currently not anticipated to be fully implemented until the first half of 2022 at the earliest 

brexit  in june 2016 the uk electorate voted in a referendum to leave the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk left the eu on january 31 2020 with status quo arrangements through a transition period scheduled to end on december 31 2020 the consequences of the uk leaving the eu and the terms of the future trading relationship continue to be highly uncertain which may pose certain implications to our research commercial and general business operations in the uk and the eu including the approval and supply of our products however both the uk and the eu have issued detailed guidance for the industry on how medicines medical devices and clinical trials will be separately regulated in their respective territories pfizer has substantially completed its preparations for brexit having made the changes necessary to meet relevant regulatory requirements in the eu and the uk through the transition period and afterwards especially in the regulatory research manufacturing and supply chain areas between 2018 and 2021 we expect to spend up to approximately 60 million in onetime costs to make these adaptations for additional information on brexit see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — the global economic environment section in our 2019 financial report  

china regulatory changes  in an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlogs for existing applications for drug approval in recent years the nmpa has unveiled numerous reform initiatives for china’s drug approval system and engaged in significant efforts to build its capabilities the nmpa divides drugs into new drugs and generics with the definition for new drugs changed from “china new” to “global new” this means that drugs previously approved in other markets such as the us or europe are not considered new drugs under china’s regulatory regime this change in definition creates more opportunities for china’s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms because multinational firms have historically had significant competitive advantage in successfully achieving regulatory approvals for drugs first approved outside of china revisions in 2019 made clear however that regulatory approval from the fda or the ema would no longer be required for approval of imported drugs though a notable exception persists for imported vaccines which still require prior approval from a reference regulatory agency such as the fda in 2019 china published a revision to its drug administration law and introduced a “marketing authorization holder” system which grants the nmpa more authority over regulating manufacturers and provides manufacturers more flexibility in contract manufacturing arrangements and manufacturing site transfers 

while challenges remain a number of other policy changes are streamlining and accelerating approvals of domestic and imported drugs in china these reforms along with china’s june 2018 elevation to the ich management committee are expected to pave the way for integration of chinese regulations with global practices these changes include introducing more streamlined processes for maintaining renewal of product registrations reduction in importing testing requirements and establishing an expedited registration pathway for drugs to treat rare diseases and serious lifethreatening illnesses with no effective treatment though certain details on implementation are unclear eg evolving list of qualified rare diseases and no guidance on what qualifies as serious life threatening the nmpa aims to build expedited pathways for certain categories of products similar to the us and european regulatory systems additionally the nmpa published changes to china’s registration requirements that align more with international practices including a 60day review timeline for clinical trial authorizations and 



guidance for acceptance of foreign clinical data and the utilization of real world data in drug development and regulatory decision making 

although a number of regulatory changes better support china’s inclusion in simultaneous global drug development unique regulatory requirements continue to pose challenges for multinational companies including china’s human genetic resources process for exporting clinical trial samples which adds months to starting a clinical trial in china mismatched china pharmacopoeia and manufacturing data requirements that require standards exceeding acceptable practices in the us eu and japan and unpredictable and inconsistent clinical trial inspection practices 

healthcare provider transparency and disclosures a number of countries have implemented laws requiring or their industry associations have recommended disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers for example the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations’ disclosure code requires all members including pfizer to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations 

intellectual property  the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2033 for leastdeveloped countries while we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world some countries have made improvements we include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries 

while the global intellectual property environment has generally improved following wtotrips and bilateralmultilateral trade agreements our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in emerging market countries in particular governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries considerable political and economic pressure exists to weaken current intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions eg new medical treatment methods revocation of patents laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries and helping improve patients’ access to innovative medicines in developed countries as well including the eu we are facing an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment 

as part of the canadaeu comprehensive economic  trade agreement ceta canada now provides sui generis protection commonly referred to as patent term restoration for patent term extensions for basic patents however the extension is capped at two years whereas the international norm is five years in addition the implementing regulations may create obstacles for patentees applying for patent term restoration via a certificate of supplementary protection csp and canada’s proposed drug pricing reforms may negatively impact the benefit of a csp furthermore the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca will when implemented require canada and mexico to make certain improvements to their current intellectual property regimes including the establishment of patent term adjustment for unreasonable delays in the grant of patents 

in china the intellectual property environment has improved in recent years although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with world trade organization provisions although china remained on the us trade representative’s priority watch list for 2019 due to ongoing enforcement challenges and china’s failure to make certain structural reforms further the standards for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in other major markets including the us europe and japan also while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent for example the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage in 2019 the regulatory authority granted marketing approval to generic products while the reference product in each case are still subject to patent protection and there is no effective legal means to resolve patent disputes prior to the marketing of those infringing drugs the us and china recently signed an initial agreement in which china has committed to address some patentrelated concerns and both governments have indicated that they will continue bilateral discussions on implementation of these commitments and other intellectual property issues in 2020 

in brazil and other latin american countries the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents eg national health surveillance agency in brazil restrictive patentability rules ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions such as new medical uses of drug products may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products additionally an increased threat of issuance of compulsory licenses for biopharmaceutical products exists which adds to business uncertainty 

in india we have seen some progress in terms of expediting patent approval processes to reduce pendency rates and implementing training programs to enhance enforcement despite these positive steps gaps remain in terms of addressing longstanding intellectual property concerns for example policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents the tendency of the 



indian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings both pre and postgrant and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to safeguard many of our inventions and our investments in innovation these policies heighten the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population challenges against pfizer patents in india are ongoing 

data privacy outside of the us many countries where we conduct business including the eu have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data and we must comply with these laws and regulations as well one applicable law is the eu’s general data protection regulation gdpr the gdpr imposes detailed obligations on companies that collect use or otherwise process personal data and penalties for noncompliance may include fines of up to 4 percent of the company’s global annual revenue additionally the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt privacy and data security laws any inability to comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards or other legal obligations regarding data protection or privacy could result in additional costs and liability to pfizer as well as reputational harm and may adversely affect our business 

environmental matters 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 16 a3  contingencies and certain commitments — legal proceedings––commercial and other matters in our 2019 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2019 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

climate change presents risks to our operations including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers for example in 2017 our manufacturing and commercial operations in puerto rico were impacted by hurricanes as our three manufacturing sites in puerto rico sustained damage and became inoperable due to issues impacting puerto rico overall all three sites resumed operations and remediation activities were completed in 2018 we cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future however we have a program for reviewing our vulnerability to potential weatherrelated risks and other natural disasters and we update our assessments periodically to date we have concluded that because of our facility locations our existing distribution networks and our controls we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on pfizer in the near term

risks related to our business industry and operations  

managed care trends 

private thirdparty payers such as health plans and other managed care entities such as pbms continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and control the cost of drugs consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private thirdparty payers private thirdparty payers as well as governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our products or failure to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing could adversely impact revenue private thirdparty payers often implement formularies with copayment tiers to encourage utilization of certain drugs and have also been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products private thirdparty payers are also implementing new initiatives like socalled “copay accumulators” policies that provide that the value of copay assistance does not count as outofpocket costs that are applied toward deductibles that can shift more of the cost burden to manufacturers and patients this cost shifting has increased consumer interest and input in medication choices as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals thirdparty payers also use additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing and valuebased pricingcontracting to improve their cost containment efforts and are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us private thirdparty payer market consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues in addition our patented products may face generic competition before patent exclusivity expires including upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products generic competition could lead to our loss of a major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time a number of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years for example lyrica a product in our upjohn business lost patent protection in the us in june 2019 and multisource generic competition began in july 2019 also the basic product patent for chantix in the us will expire in november 2020 in china we are expected to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products 

also generic manufacturers have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents or that our patents are not valid these include candidates that would compete with among other products eliquis ibrance and xeljanz our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or copromotion rights in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 



competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products including new product entrants inline branded products generic products private label products biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our inline drugs and drug candidates the introduction of competitive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of these have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

we also produce generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with products from competitors including other generic and biosimilar manufacturers the ability to launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before the anticipated formation of the generic or biosimilar marketplace is important to that product’s profitability with increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product markets our success will depend on our ability to bring new products to market quickly the fda along with other regulatory agencies around the world has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications which may result in delayed approvals of new generic products over the next few years also we may face access challenges for our biosimilar products where our product may not receive appropriate coveragereimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to the innovator product for example inflectra has experienced access challenges among commercial payers in september 2017 pfizer filed suit in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against johnson  johnson jj alleging that jj’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning remicade ® infliximab violate federal antitrust laws 

dependence on key inline products 

we recorded direct product andor alliance revenues of more than 1 billion for each of eight biopharmaceutical products in 2019 prevnar 13prevenar 13 ibrance eliquis lyrica xeljanz lipitor enbrel and chantixchampix those products accounted for 49 of our total revenues in 2019  if these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection if applicable changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling pricing and access pressures supply shortages or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant a number of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are or have been the subject of pending legal challenges for example as a result of a patent litigation settlement teva pharmaceuticals usa inc launched a generic version of viagra a product in our upjohn business in the us in december 2017 in addition lyrica a product in our upjohn business lost patent protection in the us in june 2019 and multisource generic competition began in july 2019 also the basic product patent for chantix in the us will expire in november 2020 in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products for additional information see the item 1 business––patents and other intellectual property rights section in this 2019 form 10k further our alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and copromotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity as well as to provide for earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers either through internal rd or through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties however balancing current growth investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge the average costs of product development continue to rise as do the regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas which may affect the number of candidates funded as well as the sustainability of the rd portfolio our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in rd for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth 

additionally our rd investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the scientific approach may not succeed for any given program despite the significant investment required for rd and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement 

we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the nearterm and over time these strategies may not deliver the desired result which could affect growth and profitability in the future 



biosimilars 

abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in many international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biologic products our biologic products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow for example enbrel faces ongoing biosimilar competition in most european markets the loss of patent rights due to patent expiration or litigation could trigger competition 

we are developing and commercializing biosimilar medicines risks related to our commercialization of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity coupled with intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products there is also a risk of lower uptake for biosimilars due to various factors that may vary for different biosimilars eg anticompetitive practices physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the originator product or misaligned financial incentives see also the competitive products risk factor above 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities if it receives regulatory approval for example a wider range of studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process however each additional indication and its reimbursement potential must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit the increased complexity of development and manufacturing and the potential delays to approval of the lead indication we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time the degree to which such potential challenges are foreseen and adequately addressed could affect our future results 

international operations 

our international operations could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls economic conditions expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of developed markets leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s global performance as a result we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets however our strategies in emerging markets may not be successful and these countries may not continue to sustain these growth rates for example even though china is growing faster than most emerging markets we face certain challenges in china due to government imposed pricing controls affecting certain pfizer medicines in addition some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending even though we constantly monitor the evolving emerging markets for any unanticipated risk to pfizer certain financial or political events in such markets can adversely affect our results 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products has generated payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector the impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals is increasing a number of factors create a more challenging paradigm for pfizer given our growing specialty business portfolio such as formulary restrictions and increasing use of utilization management tools such as step edits which can lead to higher negotiated rebates or discounts to health plans and pbms in the us as well as the increasing use of health technology assessments and government pressures in markets around the world 

product manufacturing sales and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing sales or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions shutdowns work stoppages or strikes approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions shortages or stockouts reputational harm product liability or unanticipated costs examples of such difficulties or delays include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products the possibility that the supply of component materials is delayed or unavailable and that the quality of such materials are substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout our internal and external supply network andor comply with cgmps and other applicable regulations such as serialization which allows for track and trace of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety 



risks to supply chain continuity and commercial operations as a result of natural including hurricanes earthquakes and floods or manmade disasters including arson or terrorist attacks at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor including those that may be related to climate change failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against economic adulteration product diversion product theft counterfeit goods and cyberattacks as an example we have been experiencing production issues with genotropin that will decrease revenue from that product 

regulatory agencies periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities to evaluate compliance with cgmp or other applicable requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions such as warning letters suspension of manufacturing seizure of product injunctions debarment recall of a product delays or denials of product approvals import bans or denials of import certifications any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in february 2017 for example we received a warning letter from the fda communicating the fda’s view that certain violations of cgmp regulations exist at hospira’s manufacturing facility in mcpherson kansas we undertook corrective actions to address the concerns raised by the fda in january 2018 the fda upgraded the status of pfizer’s mcpherson manufacturing facility to vai based on an october 2017 inspection the change to vai status lifted the compliance hold that the fda placed on approval of pending applications in june 2018 the fda informed us that it had completed an evaluation of corrective actions and closed out the february 2017 warning letter issued to our mcpherson manufacturing facility after determining that we had addressed the violations contained in the warning letter in julyaugust 2018 the fda conducted a followup inspection of our mcpherson facility and issued an inspection report noting several findings pfizer responded to the fda’s findings and is in the process of implementing a corrective and preventive action plan to address the fda’s concerns on the basis of the julyaugust 2018 fda inspection the fda changed the inspection classification of the mcpherson site to official action indicated oai future fda inspections and regulatory activities will further assess the adequacy and sustainability of these corrections implemented at the site communication with the fda on the status of the mcpherson site is ongoing as a result of the current oai classification the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval of applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates related to products manufactured at our mcpherson site until the site status is upgraded which upgrade would be based on a reinspection by the fda we have been experiencing shortages of products from the legacy hospira portfolio among others largely driven by capacity constraints technical issues supplier quality concerns or unanticipated increases in demand we have made considerable progress in remediating issues at legacy hospira facilities manufacturing sterile injectables and have substantially improved supply from most of these sites continuing product shortage interruption at these manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results 

in addition in september 2017 meridian medical technologies inc a subsidiary of pfizer inc received a warning letter from the fda asserting the fda’s view that certain violations of cgmp and quality system regulations exist at meridian’s manufacturing sites in st louis missouri and classifying the site as oai meridian responded to the warning letter and committed to making improvements across the sites we have made considerable progress addressing the concerns raised by the fda and communication with the fda is ongoing future fda inspections and regulatory activities will further assess the adequacy and sustainability of these corrections implemented at the site as a result of the oai classification the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval of applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates related to products manufactured at our st louis sites 

collaborations and other relationships with third parties 

we depend on thirdparty collaborators service providers and others in the research development manufacturing and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into joint ventures and other business development transactions in connection with our business to achieve expected longer term benefits we may make substantial upfront payments in such transactions which may negatively impact our reported earnings we rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development manufacturing and commercialization activities but we do not control many aspects of those activities we also outsource certain services to other parties including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial recruitment and execution clinical lab services nonclinical research safety services integrated facilities management and other areas failure by one or more of these third parties to complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations failure by one or more of these parties to meet their contractual or other obligations to pfizer failure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any disruption in the relationships between pfizer and one or more of these third parties could delay or prevent the development approval manufacturing or commercialization of our products and product candidates could expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables could result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues erroneous data and supply disruptions and could also result in noncompliance with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business 

biopharmaceutical wholesalers 

in 2019  our largest biopharmaceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately 16 of our total revenues and approximately 32 of our total us revenues and our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 37 of our total revenues and approximately 79 of our total us revenues if one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties such wholesaler might decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we might be unable to collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact 



our results of operations in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers including us 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through various forms of business development which can include alliances licenses joint ventures collaborations equity or debtbased investments dispositions divestments mergers and acquisitions however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated timeframes or at all and successfully integrate acquisitions pursuing these opportunities may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing and could result in increased leverage andor a downgrade of our credit ratings where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities such as in connection with our contribution agreement entered into with allogene therapeutics inc the value of those securities will fluctuate and may depreciate in value we may not control the company in which we acquire securities such as in connection with a divestiture or collaborative arrangement and as a result we will have limited ability to determine its management operational decisions and policies further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess legal proceedings or regulatory issues often arise as a result of activities that occurred at acquired companies their partners and other third parties in 2016 for example we paid 7846 million to resolve allegations related to wyeth’s reporting of prices to the government with respect to protonix for activities that occurred prior to our acquisition of wyeth for these and other reasons we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions and expected synergies and accretion may not be realized within the expected timeframes or at all 

counterfeit products 

a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicines can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual patients the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of underregulated wholesalers and repackagers the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facilities as counterfeit medicines are increasingly delivered direct to customers in small parcel packages the tendency to misuse and abuse medicines and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters compared to the large profits that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit medicines further laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

pfizer’s global reputation makes its medicines prime targets for counterfeiting organizations counterfeit medicines continue to pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents counterfeiters have been recently evolving to counterfeit life sustaining medications such as oncology medicines this shift significantly increases the risk to patients who for instance unsuspectingly purchase counterfeit oncology medications from illicit online “pharmacies” operated by criminal counterfeiting organizations failure to mitigate this new threat posed by counterfeit biopharma medicines could adversely impact our business by among other things causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation 

we have an enterprisewide strategy to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines and focused on educating patients and health care providers to reduce demand through awareness increasing engagement and education of global law enforcement customs and regulatory agencies about the growing prevalence of counterfeit life sustaining medicines enhancing online identification and disruption efforts in partnership with pharmaceutical associations to optimize resources and impact educating legislators about the risk to the security of the international drug supply chain by illicit manufacturing and distribution networks operated by transnational criminal organizations supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicines and using data analytics and risk assessment tools to better target the factors that give rise to the counterfeiting problem in the first place however our efforts and the efforts of others may not be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase 



risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings  

pricing and reimbursement 

us and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls and limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies 

in the us many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform some states have implemented and other states are considering pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible there have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products including legislation on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented see the discussion regarding pricing and reimbursement in the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — in the united states — pricing and reimbursement section in this 2019 form 10k 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in certain international markets such as the different eu member states the uk china japan canada and south korea governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices access criteria eg through public or private health technology assessments or other means of cost control particularly under recent global financing pressures as a result we expect that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue for example china in 2013 began to implement a qce process under which numerous local generics have officially been deemed bioequivalents of a qualified reference drug china’s government subsequently initiated a pilot project for centralized vbp in 2018 which included 25 molecules of drugs and covered 11 major chinese cities under this procurement model a tender process was established whereby a certain portion of included molecule volumes were guaranteed to tender winners this tender process was intended to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics and bioequivalents that had passed qce and has resulted in dramatic price cuts for offpatent medicines china’s government began nationwide expansion of the vbp pilot in december 2019 see the discussion regarding these government initiatives in china in the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states — china pricing pressures section in this 2019 form 10k we anticipate that these initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures on our drug products in china in the future 

the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccines business we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business 

us healthcare reform 

the us healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes for example the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and established a major expansion of healthcare coverage financed in part by a number of new rebates discounts and taxes that had a significant effect on our expenses and profitability see the discussion in the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — in the united states section in this 2019 form 10k we face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca there is additional uncertainty given the ruling in december 2019 by the us circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit in texas v azar that the individual mandate which is a significant provision of the aca is unconstitutional the case has been remanded to a lower court to determine whether the individual mandate is inseparable from the entire aca in which case the aca as a whole would be rendered unconstitutional in the meantime the remaining provisions of the law remain in effect the revenues generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion under the aca are not material so the impact of full invalidation of the law is expected to be limited however any future replacement of the aca may adversely affect our business and financial results particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employersponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increases industry taxes and fees any future healthcare reform efforts may adversely affect our business and financial results 

other us federal or state legislative or regulatory action andor policy efforts could adversely affect our business including among others general budget control actions changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries which is among the us presidential administration’s policy proposals revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government programs such as the implementation of international reference pricing for medicare part b drugs or changes to protected class criteria for part d drugs restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 



us entitlement reform 

in the us government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products the congressional budget office routinely releases options for reducing federal spending and the december 2018 release includes proposals to cap federal medicaid payments to the states and to require manufacturers to pay a minimum rebate on drugs covered under medicare part d for lowincome beneficiaries significant medicare reductions could also result if for example congress proceeds with certain proposals to convert the medicare feeforservice program into a premium support program or congress chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by the medicare payment advisory commission which are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of the medicare program these and any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

substantial regulation 

we are subject to extensive complex costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the us principally by the fda and the dea and foreign regulatory authorities failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution monetary penalties and other disciplinary actions including sanctions warning letters product seizures recalls fines injunctions suspension revocation of approvals corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements or exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs as well as reputational harm 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development are timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost the process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process including as the result of unfavorable preclinical and clinical trial results or unfavorable new clinical data and further analyses of existing clinical data including results that may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication we may not be able to meet anticipated preclinical or clinical endpoints commencement andor completion dates for our preclinical or clinical trials regulatory submission dates regulatory approval dates andor launch dates similarly we may not be able to successfully address all of the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the fda and the ema or obtain approval from regulators regulatory approval of drug or biologic products depends on myriad factors including a regulator making a determination as to whether a product’s benefits outweigh its known risks and a determination of the product’s efficacy additionally clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities even after a drug or biologic is approved it could be adversely affected by regulatory decisions impacting labeling manufacturing processes safety andor other matters we may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees such as the advisory committee on immunization practices that may impact the use of our vaccines further claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of inline products and product candidates can result in a negative impact on product sales product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the riskbenefit profile of products as they relate to alreadyapproved products has resulted in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for among other things additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements for these and other reasons discussed in item 1a risk factors  we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase 4 trials could result in the loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product regulatory agencies in countries outside the us often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements for example in july and december 2019 the fda updated the us prescribing information for xeljanz to include three additional boxed warnings as well as changes to the indication and dosing for ulcerative colitis in january 2020 the ema revised the summary of product characteristics smpc for xeljanz to include new warnings and recommendations for use of xeljanz due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and due to an increased risk of infections revised warnings in patients older than 65 years of age these updates were based on the fda’s and ema’s review of data from the ongoing postmarketing requirement rheumatoid arthritis study a3921133 postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products could implicate the entire class of products and this in turn could have an adverse effect on the availability or commercial viability of our products as well as other products in the class 



interactions with healthcare professionals and government officials 

risks and uncertainties apply if we provide offer or promise something of value to a healthcare professional other healthcare provider andor government official requirements or industry standards in the us and certain jurisdictions abroad that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions if an interaction is found to be improper government enforcement actions and penalties could result these risks may increase as both us and foreign enforcement agencies adopt or increase enforcement efforts in respect of existing and new laws and regulations governing product promotion marketing antibribery and kickbacks industry regulations and codes of conduct 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in laws and regulations including among others changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including tax rate changes new tax laws changes to existing tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory clarifications andor interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals including further clarifications andor interpretations of or changes to the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 competition laws privacy laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries for additional information see the provisionbenefit for taxes on income — changes in tax laws and new accounting standards sections and the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1 b basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  adoption of new accounting standards in 2019 in our 2019 financial report 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including patent litigation such as claims that our patents are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer or where one or more third parties seeks damages andor injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities product liability and other productrelated litigation including personal injury consumer offlabel promotion securities antitrust and breach of contract claims commercial environmental government investigations employment tax litigation and other legal proceedings including various means for resolving asbestos litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all of our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations 

like other pharmaceutical companies we are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the us other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the us and other jurisdictions in which we do business in addition in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government 

our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this 2019 form 10k as well as antikickback and false claims laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions like many companies in our industry we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as by consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries for example these claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

in connection with the resolution of a us government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to medicare patients in may 2018 we entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services which is effective for a period of five 



years in the cia we agreed to implement andor maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirements breaches of the cia could result in severe sanctions against us 

for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 16 a  contingencies and certain commitments — legal proceedings in our 2019 financial report 

environmental claims and proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims and proceedings amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accruals for contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks related to intellectual property  

patent protection 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinct patent laws we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including among others claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term 

our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in policies or practices that may weaken its intellectual property framework eg laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches that challenge our patent rights most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products processes or dosage forms are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of or attempts to enforce patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition andor violations of antitrust laws such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents we are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers payers governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry we also are often involved in other proceedings such as inter partes review postgrant review reexamination or opposition proceedings before the us patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others also if one of our patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products for example several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and postgrant review proceedings in the us in october 2017 the patent trial and appeal board ptab refused to initiate proceedings as to two patents in june 2018 the ptab ruled on another patent holding that one claim was valid and that all other claims were invalid the party challenging that patent has appealed the decision in november 2019 the federal circuit vacated the ptab’s ruling and requested that the ptab redecide the challenge in march and june 2019 an additional patent was found invalid in separate proceedings by the ptab we have appealed challenges to other patents remain pending in jurisdictions outside the us the invalidation of all of these patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow a competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks 



and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

third party intellectual property claims 

a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted such challenges may include negotiation and litigation which may not always be successful 

part of our business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities which may involve litigation associated costs and time delays and may ultimately not be successful these opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired where patents have been declared invalid or where products do not infringe the patents of others and in some circumstances we may take action such as litigation asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a “firsttomarket” or early market position for our products 

third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and timeconsuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launches and may result in significant damages we are involved in patentrelated disputes with third parties over our attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic pharmaceuticals products or biosimilars we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings including any appeals have not been resolved ie “atrisk” launch if one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party such third party may be awarded significant damages or we may be prevented from further sales of that product such damages may be enhanced as much as threefold in the event that we or one of our subsidiaries like hospira is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

risk related to technology  

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our businesses in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including but not limited to personal information and intellectual property and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems and those of our thirdparty vendors with whom we contract and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal groups “hacktivists” nation states and others as a global pharmaceutical company our systems are subject to frequent attacks due to the nature of some of these attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology our efforts may not prevent service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 



risks related to our strategic transactions  

strategic acquisitions 

the success of any of our strategic acquisitions will depend in large part on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from combining these businesses with pfizer we for example may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with certain of these acquisitions or such cost savings within the expected time frame similarly the accretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisitions may not be realized or may be delayed integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business including thirdparty relationships or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies we also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control unsuccessful clinical trials regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates including those acquired in these acquisitions hospira for example has experienced manufacturing disruptions and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues manufacturing problems as well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our business development initiatives section in our 2019 financial report 

pending combination of upjohn with mylan 

pfizer mylan and upjohn may be unable to satisfy the conditions or obtain the approvals required to complete the combination of upjohn with mylan the combination and regulatory agencies may delay or impose conditions on approval of the combination which may diminish the anticipated benefits of the combination 

the consummation of the combination is subject to numerous conditions including the receipt by pfizer of an internal revenue service ruling and an opinion of its tax counsel to the effect that among other things certain transactions related to the combination and certain related transactions will constitute a taxfree “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a1d of the internal revenue code the approval of the combination by mylan shareholders and other customary conditions certain of which are dependent upon the actions of third parties as a result of such conditions pfizer cannot make any assurances that the combination will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all 

completion of the combination is also conditioned upon the receipt of certain required government consents and approvals including certain approvals required from regulatory agencies while pfizer mylan and upjohn intend to pursue vigorously all required governmental approvals the requirement to receive these approvals prior to the consummation of the combination could delay the completion of the combination possibly for a significant period of time any delay in the completion of the combination could diminish the anticipated benefits of the combination or result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the combination including delaying pfizer’s ability to capitalize on its strategy of becoming a more focused innovative company as well as upjohn’s ability to optimize the execution of its growth strategies 

pfizer may be subject to shareholder lawsuit or other actions filed in connection with or in opposition to the combination or any related transactions such litigation could have an adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations of pfizer and could prevent or delay the consummation of the combination 

pfizer has expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses due to legal advisory printing and financial services fees related to the combination including costs required to obtain the required government consents or defend or settle actions noted above we expect to incur costs of approximately 500 million in connection with fully separating upjohn inclusive of 145 million incurred in 2019 such charges will include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and anticipated transaction costs many of these expenses must be paid regardless of whether the combination is consummated and even if the expected benefits of the combination are not achieved additionally the completion of the combination including for example obtaining regulatory approvals will require significant time and attention from pfizer management and may divert attention from the daytoday operations of our business 

even if the combination is completed as anticipated pfizer may not realize some or all of the expected benefits furthermore upjohn may experience operational challenges in integrating the upjohn and mylan businesses which may also diminish the anticipated benefits of the combination 

even if the combination is completed the anticipated operational financial strategic and other benefits of the combination may not be achieved there are many factors that could impact the anticipated benefits from the combination including among others strategic adjustments required to reflect the nature of our business following the combination any negative reaction to the combination by our customers and business partners and increased risks resulting from pfizer becoming a company that is more focused on innovative medicines in addition pfizer has agreed to provide certain transition services to the combined company generally for an initial period of 24 months following the completion of the combination with certain possibilities for extension these obligations under the transition agreements may result in additional expenses and may divert 



pfizer’s focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing pfizer’s business an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the combination as well as any delays encountered in the process could have an adverse effect on the revenues level of expenses and operating results of our business 

furthermore the combination is a complex costly and timeconsuming process even if upjohn and mylan successfully integrate pfizer upjohn and mylan cannot predict with certainty if or when the anticipated synergies growth opportunities and benefits resulting from the combination will occur or the extent to which they actually will be achieved for example the benefits from the combination may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies or by required capital expenditures related to the combined businesses in addition the quantification of synergies expected to result from the combination is based on significant estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain realization of any benefits and synergies could be affected by a number of factors beyond pfizer’s mylan’s upjohn’s or the combined company’s control including without limitation general economic conditions increased operating costs regulatory developments and the other risks described in these risk factors the amount of synergies actually realized in the combination if any and the time periods in which any such synergies are realized could differ materially from the synergies anticipated to be realized regardless of whether the two business operations are combined successfully if the integration is unsuccessful or if the combined company is unable to realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the combination there could be a material adverse effect on the combined company’s share price business financial condition and results of operations 

consumer healthcare joint venture with gsk 

on july 31 2019 we completed the transaction in which we and gsk combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the gsk consumer healthcare name following the integration of the combined business gsk intends to separate the joint venture as an independent company via a demerger of its equity interest to its shareholders and a listing of the combined business on the uk equity market in february 2020 gsk announced the initiation of a twoyear program to prepare for the separation of gsk into two companies including a standalone consumer healthcare company until the fifth anniversary of the closing of the transaction gsk will have the sole right to decide whether and when to initiate a separation and listing and may also sell all or part of its stake in the joint venture in a contemporaneous initial public offering should a separation and listing occur during the first five years after closing pfizer has the option to participate through the distribution of some or all of its equity interest in the joint venture to its shareholders following a separation or listing and subject to customary lockup or similar restrictions pfizer will also have the ability to sell its equity interest in the joint venture through the capital markets after the fifth anniversary of the closing of the transaction both gsk and pfizer will have the right to decide whether and when to initiate a separation and public listing of the joint venture the planned separation and public listing transactions may not be initiated or completed within the expected time periods or at all and both the timing and success of any separation and public listing transaction as well as the value generated for pfizer or its shareholders in any such transaction will be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such transaction although pfizer is entitled to participate in any separation and listing transaction initiated by gsk prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing it is not required to do so and any future distribution or sale of pfizer’s equity stake in the joint venture will similarly be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such transaction pfizer’s ability to complete any such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the size of pfizer’s retained equity stake at the time the uncertainty relating to the separation and public listing transactions their implementation their timing and their yet to be determined effects on the joint venture’s business may subject us and the joint venture to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business and financial results 

moreover although we have certain consent board representation and other governance rights with respect to the joint venture pfizer is a minority owner of the joint venture as a result pfizer does not have control over the joint venture its management or its policies and we may have business interests strategies and goals that differ in certain respects from those of gsk or the joint venture 

in addition the joint venture will be subject to the risks associated with the joint venture’s consumer healthcare business and the business financial condition and results of operations of the joint venture may be affected by factors that are different from or in addition to those that previously affected the business financial condition and results of operations of pfizer’s historical consumer healthcare business many of these factors are outside of our and the joint venture’s control and could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the joint venture 

the success of the transaction will also depend in part on the joint venture’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost synergies from the transaction these anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time period the joint venture’s integration of pfizer’s and gsk’s historic consumer healthcare businesses may result in material unanticipated problems costs expenses liabilities competitive responses and loss of customer and other business relationships any material unanticipated issues arising from the integration process could negatively impact our stock price and our or the joint venture’s future business and financial results  



other risks 

the global economic environment 

like all businesses of our size we are exposed to both global and industryspecific economic conditions governments corporations and insurance companies which provide insurance benefits to patients have implemented increases in costsharing and restrictions on access to medicines potentially causing patients to switch to generic or biosimilar products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments as discussed above government financing pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices access criteria eg through public or private health technology assessments or other means of cost control 

the global economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources due to our significant operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions but there can be no guarantee that changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources or impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

we continue to monitor credit capital restrictions and economic situations in volatile regions and markets especially where the ability to obtain us dollars for local currency is unpredictable and challenging we cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in these economic conditions or what impact they may have on our results of operations financial condition or business 

in addition given that a significant portion of our business is conducted in the eu including the uk the formal change in the relationship between the uk and the eu caused by brexit may pose certain implications for our research commercial and general business operations in the uk and the eu including the approval and supply of our products details on how brexit will be finally executed and the impact on the remaining eu countries will dictate how and whether the broader eu will be impacted and what the resulting impact on our business may be for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– the global economic environment section in our 2019 financial report 

public health epidemics or outbreaks could adversely impact our business in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 emerged in wuhan hubei province china  while initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in china and caused significant disruptions to its economy it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally the extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration of the outbreak new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact among others in particular the continued spread of the coronavirus globally could adversely impact our operations including among others our manufacturing and supply chain sales and marketing and clinical trial operations and could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results 

we also continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments if trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economic activity or if other factors lead to a general economic downturn potential impacts could include declining sales increased costs volatility in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments required increases of our pension funding obligations increased government cost control efforts delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

foreign exchange and interest rate risk 

significant portions of our revenues costs and expenses as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 54 of our total 2019 revenues were derived from international operations including 21 from europe and 24 from china japan and the rest of asia as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the chinese renminbi the japanese yen the canadian dollar the uk pound and approximately 100 other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses if the us dollar were to weaken against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would increase having a positive impact on earnings and our overall expenses would increase having a negative impact on earnings conversely if the us dollar were to strengthen against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would decrease having a negative impact on earnings and our overall expenses would decrease having a positive impact on earnings therefore significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations including venezuela and argentina can impact our results and financial guidance  for additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk see the item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign exchange risk section in this 2019 form 10k and the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and 



outlook –– our financial guidance for 2020 and analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources sections in our 2019 financial report 

in addition our interestbearing investments and borrowings and our pension benefit obligations net and our postretirement benefit obligations net are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks related to interestbearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — financial risk management section in this 2019 form 10k for additional details see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions ––benefit plans section and the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7 f  financial instruments  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and — note 11  pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans in our 2019 financial report which are incorporated by reference 

from time to time we issue variable rate debt based on libor or undertake interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor the uk financial conduct authority announced in july 2017 that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates that are currently used to calculate libor after 2021 various governing parties including government agencies are working on a benchmark transition plan for libor and other interbank offered rates globally  we are monitoring their progress and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected additionally uncertainty as to the nature of a potential discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks for additional information see the analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources — selected measures of liquidity and capital resources — libor section in our 2019 financial report 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

market fluctuations in our equity investments 

in 2018 we adopted a new accounting standard whereby certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value now recognized in net income we expect the adoption of this new accounting standard may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of certain equity investments for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 4 other incomedeductions — net in our 2019 financial report and the item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — financial risk management section in this 2019 form 10k 

our pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations net of our plan assets are subject to volatility from changes in fair value of equity investments and other investment risk for additional information see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions — benefit plans section and the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 11 pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans in our 2019 financial report 

cost and expense controlunusual eventsfailure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitions 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings internal reorganizations product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of i our costreduction and productivity initiatives ii the reorganization of our commercial operations in 2019 iii any other corporate strategic initiatives and iv any acquisitions divestitures or other initiatives such as our agreement to combine upjohn with mylan creating a new global pharmaceutical company which is anticipated to close in mid2020 our acquisition of array and the formation of the new consumer healthcare joint venture with gsk 

intangible assets goodwill and equitymethod investments 

our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future if the associated rd effort is abandoned the related iprd assets will likely be writtenoff and we will record an impairment charge for goodwill all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity any such charge may be significant our other intangible 



assets including developed technology rights and brands face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assets may be significant as well for additional details see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions section in our 2019 financial report 

we also regularly review our equitymethod investments for impairment an impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments we may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment events related to particular customers or asset types challenging market conditions or decisions by management 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas

financial risk management 

the objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings we manage these financial exposures through operational means and through the use of thirdparty instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

foreign exchange risk 

we operate globally and as such we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations as well as in our financial assets investments and liabilities borrowings our net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to currency risk 

on the commercial side a significant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — the global economic environment section in our 2019 financial report for the key currencies in which we operate we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing samecurrency revenues in relation to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets in relation to samecurrency liabilities where foreign exchange risk cannot be mitigated via operational means we may use foreign currency forwardexchange contracts andor foreign currency swaps to manage that risk 

with respect to our financial assets and liabilities our primary foreign exchange exposure arises predominantly from shortterm and longterm intercompany receivables and payables and to a lesser extent from shortterm and longterm investments and debt where the assets andor liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business entity 

we also hedge some forecasted intercompany sales denominated in euro japanese yen chinese renminbi uk pound canadian dollar and australian dollar to protect against longerterm movements 

in addition under certain market conditions we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities in these cases we may use foreign currency swaps foreign currency forwardexchange contracts andor foreign currency debt 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair valuation methodologies see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7a financial instruments  fair value measurements in our 2019 financial report 

the fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not have any effect on another currency’s rates relative to the us dollar if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10 as of december 31 2019  the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and on our borrowings we manage interest rate risk in the aggregate while focusing on pfizer’s immediate and intermediate liquidity needs 

with respect to our investments we strive to maintain a predominantly floatingrate basis position but our strategy may change based on prevailing market conditions our floatingrate assets are subject to the risk that shortterm interest rates may fall and as a result the investments would generate less interest income fixedrate investments provide a known amount of interest income regardless of a change in interest rates we sometimes use interest rate swaps in our financial investment portfolio 



we borrow primarily on a longterm fixedrate basis from time to time depending on market conditions we will change the profile of our outstanding debt by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair valuation methodologies see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7a financial instruments  fair value measurements in our 2019 financial report 

the fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes in this sensitivity analysis holding all other assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments if there were a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates as of december 31 2019  the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant 

equity price risk 

we hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions while we are holding such securities we are subject to equity price risk and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments from time to time we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations which may include limiting our price risk

commercial operations 

from the second quarter of our 2016 fiscal year until the end of 2018 we managed our commercial operations through two distinct business segments pfizer innovative health ih and pfizer essential health eh the ih and eh operating segments were each led by a single manager each operating segment had responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain iprd projects for new investigational products and additional indications for inline products that generally have achieved proofofconcept each business had a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets   

at the beginning of our fiscal year 2019 we began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of three businesses each of which is led by a single manager—pfizer biopharmaceuticals group biopharma upjohn and consumer healthcare we designed this new global structure to take advantage of new growth opportunities driven by the evolving and unique dynamics of relevant markets 

some additional information about each business follows 

 

results for 2018 and prior periods in our 2018 form 10k are reported on the basis under which we managed our businesses in 2018 and do not reflect the 2019 reorganization beginning with our firstquarter 2019 financial results our financial reporting will reflect the new organizational structure

collaboration and copromotion agreements 

we are party to collaboration andor copromotion agreements relating to certain biopharmaceutical products including among others eliquis  xtandi  and bavencio  revenues from eliquis  except in certain markets where we have direct sales  xtandi  and bavencio  are included in alliance revenues 

eliquis  has been jointly developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with bms pfizer funds between 50 and 60 of all development costs depending on the study profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis except in certain countries where pfizer commercializes eliquis  and pays bms compensation based on a percentage of net sales we have full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets bms supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to endcustomers in these markets eliquis  is part of the novel oral anticoagulant market the agents in this class were developed as alternative treatment options to warfarin in appropriate patients 

xtandi  is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with astellas the two companies share equally in the gross profits losses related to us net sales of xtandi  subject to certain exceptions pfizer and astellas also share equally all xtandi  commercialization costs attributable to the us market in addition pfizer and astellas share certain development and other collaboration expenses and pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international xtandi  net sales recorded in other incomedeductions––net  xtandi  is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells 

bavencio  avelumab is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with merck kgaa both companies jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs and split equally any profits generated from selling any products containing avelumab from this collaboration bavencio  is currently approved in metastatic merkel cell carcinoma and for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in certain countries and in development as a potential treatment for multiple other types of cancer 

research and development 

innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable   our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs 

our rd priorities and strategy 

our rd priorities include 

 

to that end our research and development primarily focuses on 

 

in january 2018 we announced our decision to end internal neuroscience discovery and early development efforts and reallocate funding to other areas where we have stronger scientific leadership the development of tanezumab and potential treatments for rare neuromuscular disorders is not impacted by this decision in june 2018 we announced our plan to invest up to 600 million in biotechnology and other emerging growth companies through pfizer ventures our venture investment vehicle in september 2018 we and bain capital entered into a transaction to create a new biopharmaceutical company cerevel to continue development of a portfolio of clinical and preclinical stage neuroscience assets primarily targeting disorders of the central nervous system including parkinson’s disease epilepsy alzheimer’s disease schizophrenia and addiction for additional information on the transaction with bain capital see the notes to consolidated financial statements–– note 2b acquisitions divestitures assets and liabilities held for sale licensing arrangements research and development and collaborative arrangements equitymethod investments and privately held investment divestitures  in our 2018 financial report 

while a significant portion of rd is done internally we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines by entering into collaboration alliance and license agreements with other companies as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity or debtbased investments these agreements enable us to codevelop license or acquire promising compounds technologies or capabilities we also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of the development costs of one or more of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments revenue sharing payments profit sharing payments andor royalties collaboration alliance license and funding agreements and equity or debtbased investments allow us to share risk and cost and to access external scientific and technological expertise and provide us the opportunity to advance our own products as well as the inlicensed or acquired products 

our rd operations 

we conduct rd internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms in 2018 we continued to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time   

our rd spending in 2018 was conducted through a number of matrix organizations 

 

at the beginning of 2019 we reorganized our rd operations as part of our organizing for growth reorganization 

 

for discussion regarding these rd matrix organizations and additional information on our rd operations and expenses see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our strategy — description of research and development operations   and costs and expenses — research and development rd expenses  sections in our 2018  financial report 

our rd pipeline and competition 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development the process from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years 

as of january 29 2019  we had the following number of projects in various stages of rd 

development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs while these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products in addition to discovering and developing new products our rd efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — product developments––biopharmaceutical  section in our 2018  financial report which is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to rd we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence in addition several of our competitors operate without large rd expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration for additional information see the competition  and item 1a risk factors — competitive products  sections below 

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the us in 2018 operations in developed and emerging markets were managed through our two business segments ih and eh emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastestgrowing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets urbanization in emerging markets particularly in asia is creating additional access opportunities for our medicines 

we sell our products in over 125 countries revenues from operations outside the us of 283 billion  accounted for 53  of our total revenues in 2018  by total revenues china and japan are our two largest national markets outside the us for a geographic breakdown of revenues see the table captioned geographic information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  in our 2018  financial report and the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview  and   — revenues by segment and geography  sections in our 2018  financial report 



our international operations are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries including among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations and expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors — international operations  below our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws and regulations on pricing reimbursement and access to our products see item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states  below for a discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments depending upon market conditions for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7 f  financial instruments  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2018  financial report as well as the   forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section in our 2018  financial report those sections of our 2018  financial report are incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical businesses we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants and pharmacists mcos that provide insurance coverage such as hospitals integrated delivery systems pharmacy benefit managers and health plans and employers and government agencies who hire mcos to provide health benefits to their employees we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies and in the case of our vaccines products in the us we primarily sell directly to the us centers for disease control and prevention wholesalers individual provider offices retail pharmacies and integrated delivery networks we seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and pbm formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the pbms pbms use various benefit designs such as tiered copays for formulary products to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions we may also work with payers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

in 2018  our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 37  of our total revenues and approximately 76  of our total us revenues 

 of 2018  total revenues and us revenues from 

major biopharmaceutical wholesalers and other customers 

our global consumer healthcare business uses its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products and occasionally uses distributors and agents principally in smaller markets the advertising and promotions for our consumer healthcare business are generally disseminated to consumers through television print digital and other media advertising as well as through instore promotion consumer healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies retail chains and grocery and convenience stores our consumer healthcare business generates a significant portion of its sales from several large customers the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the consumer healthcare business 



patents and other intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance to pfizer trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country further patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product for additional information see item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states — intellectual property  below 

in various markets a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided to certain therapeutics upon approval the scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but in general the period of regulatory exclusivity will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the therapeutic 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period andor the granted patent term extension are those for the medicines set forth in the table below unless otherwise indicated the years set forth in the table below pertain to the basic product patent expiration for the respective products patent term extensions supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below unless they have been granted by the issuing authority in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions to methods of manufacturing or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect our drug from generic or as applicable biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent 



 

a number of our current products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years for additional information including further discussion of our products experiencing or expected to experience in 2019  patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the us europe or japan see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights   section in our 2018  financial report and item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products   below 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents these include candidates that would compete with among other products eliquis  xeljanz  and xtandi  we also are often involved in other proceedings such as inter partes review postgrant review reexamination or opposition proceedings before the us patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others  for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 a1  contingencies and certain commitments — legal proceedings––patent litigation  in our 2018  financial report 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms or conversion of the active ingredient to otc products 

biologic products 

our biologic products including benefix  refacto  xyntha  bavencio  prevnar 13prevenar 13  and enbrel  we market enbrel  outside the us and canada may face in the future or already face competition from biosimilars also referred to as followon biologics in the us such biosimilars would reference our originator biologic products approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a followon recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin  that was approved under the ffdca 

biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety purity or potency biosimilars have the potential to offer highquality lowercost alternatives to biologic medicines abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca in 2010 a framework for such approval exists in the us in europe the european commission grants marketing authorizations for biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals 

as part of our business strategy we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths to develop and commercialize biosimilar medicines see item 1a risk factors — biologic products  below 

we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biologic products likewise as we develop manufacture and seek to launch biosimilars patents may be asserted against us 

international 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years we have seen some improvement in global protection of intellectual property rights for additional information see item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states — intellectual property  below 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications  the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased biopharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products 

this competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in rd as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians payers and global health authorities we also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs we believe that we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines for example prevnar 13  may face competition in the form of alternative 13valent or additional valent nextgeneration pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents which may adversely affect our future results 

our generics and biosimilars businesses compete with branded products from competitors as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers globally pfizer sells generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain competitors’ solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products as well as biosimilars we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “firstto 



market” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars as a “firsttomarket” position provides customers a lowercost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with potentially higher levels of sales and profitability until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market 

our consumer healthcare business faces competition from otc business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies and retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources customer acceptance product quality our and our competitors’ introduction of new products ingredients claims dosage forms or other forms of innovation and pricing regulatory and legislative matters such as product labeling patient access and prescription to otc switches 

managed care organizations 

the evolution of managed care in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 298 million people in the us now have some form of health insurance coverage due to the expansion of health insurance coverage see item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — in the united states  below the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the us continues to grow in importance 

the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate as well as their importance to pfizer 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures mcos typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine volume purchasing longterm contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs in addition by placing branded medicines on highertier status in their formularies leading to higher patient copays or nonpreferred tier status mcos transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient resulting in significant outofpocket expenses for the patient especially for chronic treatments this financial disincentive is a tool for mcos to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the mcos mcos also use additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing “copay accumulator” programs and valuebased pricingcontracting to improve their cost containment efforts we are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them 

due to their generally lower cost generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of mco formularies the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos are currently evaluating the appropriate placement of biosimilars on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies however increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a nonpreferred status 

mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

the aca has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes we anticipate continued congressional interest in modifying provisions of the aca particularly given the recent ruling in texas v azar to invalidate the law as unconstitutional though we believe it is unlikely congress will find bipartisan consensus to advance any significant changes to the aca until the legal process unfolds we are monitoring any such actions to see if any changes to the aca will be enacted that would impact our business 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time several competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product 



patents before their expiration generic competitors often operate without large rd expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less in china for example we are expected to face strong competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2019 which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute for brandname drugs generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs in a small subset of states prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution favoring generics may reduce sales of our branded products 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources in 2018  we experienced periodic shortages of select materials due to constrained capacity or operational challenges with the associated suppliers supplier management activities are ongoing to work to ensure the necessary supply to meet our requirements for these materials no significant impact to our operations is anticipated in 2019 

government regulation and price constraints 

pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business certain laws and regulations that govern pfizer’s business are discussed below 

general   our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our products could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmental bodies for additional information on these proceedings and actions see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 a  contingencies and certain commitments — legal proceedings  in our 2018  financial report criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties warning letters and product recalls or seizures delays in product approvals as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions could result from such proceedings and actions 

in the united states 

drug regulation   in the us biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre and postmarket regulation by the fda including regulations that govern among other things the safety and efficacy of our medicines clinical trials advertising and promotion manufacturing labeling and record keeping our products are also subject to postmarket surveillance under the ffdca and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs as well as the public health service act and its implementing regulations with respect to biologics our consumer healthcare products are also subject to fda regulation 

other us federal agencies including the dea also regulate certain of our products the us federal trade commission has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products including otc drugs and dietary supplements many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec 

biopharmaceutical companies seeking to market a product in the us must first test the product to demonstrate that it is safe and effective for its intended use if after evaluation the fda determines the product is safe ie its benefits outweigh its known risks and effective then the fda will approve the product for marketing issuing a nda or bla as appropriate companies seeking to market a generic prescription drug must scientifically demonstrate that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug the anda or generic drug application must show among other things that the generic drug is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand the manufacturer is capable of making the drug correctly and the proposed label is the same as that of the innovatorbrand drug’s label 

even after a drug or biologic is approved for marketing it may still be subject to postmarketing commitments or postmarketing requirements postmarketing commitments are studies or clinical trials that the drug or biologic sponsor has agreed to conduct but are not required by law andor regulation postmarketing requirements include studies and clinical trials that sponsors are required to conduct by law andor regulation as a condition of approval postmarketing studies or clinical trials can be required in order to assess a known risk or demonstrate clinical benefit for drugs or biologics approved pursuant to accelerated approval if a company fails to meet its postmarketing requirements the fda may assess a civil monetary penalty issue a warning letter or deem the drug or biologic misbranded once a drug or biologic is approved any modifications to the product must be notified to the fda and may also require a manufacturer to submit additional studies or conduct clinical trials in addition we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cgmps as well as advertising and promotion regulations failure to comply with the ffdca may subject us to administrative andor judicial sanctions including warning letters product recalls seizures delays in product approvals injunctions fines civil penalties andor criminal prosecution 

biosimilar regulation  the aca created a framework for the approval of biosimilars also known as followon biologics following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic 

the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars through fda approvals and the issuance of draft and final guidance the fda has addressed a number of issues related to the biosimilars approval pathway such as the labeling expectations for biosimilars over the next several years the fda is expected to issue additional draft and final guidance documents impacting biosimilars including updated draft or final guidance regarding the standards for demonstrating interchangeability with a uslicensed reference product in addition in 2017 the biosimilar user fee act was reauthorized for a fiveyear period which should lead to a significant increase in the fda’s biosimilar user fee revenues thereby providing the fda with additional resources to process biosimilar applications for example in the first year under the newly authorized fee structure the fda estimates its revenues from biosimilar user fees will increase by more than 10 million 

sales and marketing laws and regulations   the marketing practices of us biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended among other things to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and to protect the integrity of government healthcare programs these laws include antikickback laws and false claims laws antikickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company from soliciting offering receiving or paying anything of value to generate business including purchasing or prescribing of a particular product false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented any claims for payment for goods including drugs or biologics or services to thirdparty payers including medicare and medicaid that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions andor exclusion from federal healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid the federal government and various states also have enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies the laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers require disclosure to the federal or state government and the public of such interactions andor require the adoption of compliance standards or programs many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations 

pricing and reimbursement   pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program the 340b drug pricing program and the medicare part d program pfizer must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program and medicare part b the calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose pfizer to penalties see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview   section in our 2018  financial report and in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1 g  basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  revenues and trade accounts receivable   in our 2018  financial report which are incorporated by reference 

government and private thirdparty payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products for example the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under medicaid restrictions exist for some pfizer products under certain state medicaid programs as another example access to our products under the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans with which state medicaid agencies contract to provide services to medicaid beneficiaries given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises a growing number of states are considering a variety of costcontrol strategies including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers who are the primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products in the us will increase pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers including us 

efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products including legislation on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented recently there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals at the federal level for example in may 2018 president trump released his blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce outofpocket costs blueprint certain proposals in the blueprint and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry as another example in october 2018 the centers for medicare and medicaid services solicited public comments on potential changes to payment for certain medicare part b drugs including reducing the medicare payment amount for selected medicare part b drugs to more closely align with international drug prices in addition in january 2019 the white house office of management and budget released the long awaited proposed rule submitted by the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services to remove safe harbor protections for drug rebates paid to insurance plans and pbms for medicare part d and managed medicaid and to create new safe harbors among other changes the proposed rule would explicitly exclude the reductions in price offered by drug manufacturers to pbms in medicare part d and managed medicaid plans from protection under the “discount” safe harbor it would also create a new safe harbor designed specifically for price reductions in pharmaceutical products but only those that are fully reflected in the price to the patient at the pharmacy counter additionally a new safe harbor was proposed to protect administrative fees paid to pbms which must be at fair market value a fixed fee and not based upon a percentage of volume or list price manufacturers could continue to negotiate price reductions with pbms and medicare part d and managed medicaid plans if their reductions meet that criterion the proposed rule represents a large step toward significantly altering the current rebate model in place with mcos we are in the process of evaluating the implications of the proposed rule on our operations and processes as well as the infrastructure that will be required in order to implement the rule once it is finalized there have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices certain state legislation has been subject to legal challenges adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing at the federal or state level could further affect demand for or pricing of our products 

we believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we will continue to work with lawmakers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes lower costs to the healthcare system and ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system 

healthcare reform  there have been significant efforts at the federal and state levels to reform the healthcare system by enhancing access to healthcare improving the delivery of healthcare and further rationalizing payment for healthcare for example we face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca for example tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017 eliminates the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 the socalled “individual mandate” we anticipate continued congressional interest in modifying provisions of the aca particularly given the recent ruling in texas v azar to invalidate the law as unconstitutional at this time the law remains in effect pending appeals of the decision given the outcomes of the 2018 us midterm elections with democrats taking over the us house of representatives and republicans growing their majority in the us senate we believe it is unlikely congress will find bipartisan consensus to advance any significant changes to the aca until the legal process unfolds the revenues generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion under the aca are not material so the impact of the change in law and similar recent administration actions is expected to be limited any future replacement modification or repeal of the aca may adversely affect our business and financial results particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employersponsored insurance coverage as another example the bipartisan budget act of 2018 which increased the discount we pay in the medicare part d “coverage gap” from 50 to 70 will modestly increase our future medicare part d rebates any future healthcare reform efforts may adversely affect our business and financial results 

anticorruption   the fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations 

outside the united states   

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries 

new drug approvals  in the eu the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the mutual recognition procedure the decentralized procedure or the eu centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the european economic area countries norway iceland and liechtenstein the centralized procedure managed by the ema results in one single authorization for the whole eu which provides the most rapid and efficient means of gaining approval across the eu and is the one most commonly used for new products 

in china the regulatory system historically presented numerous challenges for the pharmaceutical industry as its requirements for drug development and registration were often inconsistent with us or other international standards in recent years however china has introduced reforms and draft reforms which are discussed in more detail below that attempt to address these challenges 2018 was another active year in this respect with a number of reforms coming into effect and more proposals and drafts being issued for consultation also in 2018 a significant government restructuring resulted in the creation of the national medical product administration nmpa replacing the former cfda 

in japan the pmda is the point of entry for businesses looking to sell drugs in the country the pmda which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities including clinical studies approvals postmarketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety must approve an application before a new drug product may be marketed in japan the pmda also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals 

health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority ie similar to the authority of the fda or the ema before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval 

pharmacovigilance   in the eu detailed legislation and guidance on pharmacovigilance has increased and strengthened in recent years the ema’s pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the eu authorities eu regulators may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization safety and efficacy studies at the time of approval or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products outside developed markets such as the eu and japan pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive but there is a trend toward increasing regulation 

pricing and reimbursement  in europe japan china canada south korea and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at lowtozero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global economic pressures  governments may use a variety of costcontainment measures for our pharmaceutical products including price cuts mandatory rebates health technology assessments forced localization as a condition of market access and international reference pricing ie the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries this international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying health outcomes and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

in particular international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation price variations exacerbated by international reference pricing systems also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries 

in addition several important multilateral organizations such as the united nations un including the world health organization who and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations eg 2016 un high level panel report on access to medicines  late in 2018 two new reports critical of the pharmaceutical industry’s pricing practices were published oecd’s  pharmaceutical innovation and access to medicines and who’s pricing of cancer medicines and its impacts  these reports and upcoming public forums focused on their recommendations will continue to exert additional pricing pressures 

in china pricing pressures have increased in recent years top chinese government officials have consistently emphasized the importance of improved health outcomes the need for healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as a key indicator of progress towards reform even though the government provides basic health insurance for the vast majority of chinese citizens the insurance is not adequate to cover innovative medicines alternative funding sources for innovative medicines remain suboptimal as private health insurance growth is restrained by issues with access to healthcare data potential corruption concerns and control over providers 

in 2017 and 2018 chinese authorities entered into special negotiations with china’s national medical security bureau to add approximately 60 highvalue drugs mainly oncology medicines to the national reimbursement drug list prices for drugs were reduced dramatically through these negotiations some by as much as 70 percent while these negotiations included a path to access for companies market access is not strictly assured in addition significant questions about the processes and negotiations for provincial tendering remain in addition multilayered negotiations are required across provincial municipal and hospital levels and the linkage of price negotiations to reimbursement is inconsistent in the offpatent space in 2013 china began to implement a quality consistency qce process in order to improve the quality of domesticallymanufactured generic drugs primarily by requiring such drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug typically the originator drug in 2018 numerous local generics were officially deemed bioequivalent under the qce a pilot project for centralized procurement of 31 categories of drugs covering 11 major chinese cities now drives patients to generics that have passed the qce which has resulted in dramatic price cuts for offpatent drugs 

in japan the access environment for innovative medicines continued to deteriorate in 2018 with tighter restrictions around the criteria to gain a price maintenance premium and a push by the japanese government to adopt healthcare technology assessments based on rigid costeffectiveness criteria for repricing of reimbursed medicines additionally the japanese government has officially requested the ministry of health labour and welfare to look into using costeffectiveness analyses to make reimbursement decisions at the launch of a drug 

eu regulatory changes   the eu adopted a new clinical trials regulation in may 2014 which is expected to come into effect sometime in late 2019 this regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the eu and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results 

brexit  in june 2016 the uk electorate voted in a referendum to leave the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government formally notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu after it triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty to begin the twoyear negotiation process establishing the terms of the exit and outlining the future relationship between the uk and the eu formal negotiations officially started in june 2017 this process continues to be highly complex and the end result of these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research commercial and general business operations in the uk and the eu including the approval and supply of our products the ema will be relocating from london uk to amsterdam netherlands by the scheduled date of brexit at the end of march 2019 at present it is still unclear whether and to what extent the uk will remain within or aligned to the eu system of medicines regulation andor what separate requirements will be imposed in the uk after it leaves the eu however both the uk and the eu have issued detailed guidance for the industry on how medicines medical devices and clinical trials will be separately regulated in their respective territories in the event of a ‘hard brexit’ meaning an outcome where no negotiated settlement is reached  for additional information on brexit see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — the global economic environment   in our 2018  financial report  

china regulatory changes   in an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlogs for existing applications for drug approval the nmpa has unveiled numerous reform initiatives for china’s drug approval system and engaged in significant efforts to build its capabilities the nmpa now divides drugs into new drugs and generics with the definition for new drugs changed from “china new” to “global new” this means that drugs previously approved in other markets such as the us or europe will not be considered new drugs under china’s regulatory regime this change in definition creates more opportunities for china’s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms because multinational firms have historically had significant competitive advantage in successfully achieving regulatory approvals for drugs first approved outside of china revisions in 2017 made clear however that regulatory approval from the fda or the ema would no longer be required for approval of imported drugs though a notable exception persists for imported vaccines which still require prior approval from a relevant regulatory agency the “marketing authorization holder” system which will allow for more flexibility in contract manufacturing arrangements and asset transfers is now being piloted in ten chinese provinces but not yet for imported drugs 

while challenges remain a number of other policy changes are streamlining and accelerating approvals of domestic and imported drugs in china these reforms along with china’s june 2018 entry into the management committee of the international council for harmonisation of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use are expected to pave the way for integration of chinese regulations with global practices these changes include introducing an umbrella clinical trial authorization for all three phases of registration studies instead of the original phasebyphase approvals a filingrecordation system for bioequivalence studies on generics instead of the original review and approval system admitting more categories of drugs as innovative drugs eligible for the fast track“green channel” approval pathway and ongoing implementation of previously announced regulatory reforms in 2018 the review timeline for clinical trial authorizations was shortened to 60 working days due to the introduction of a clinical trial notification system and china’s fast track policy was finalized for a specific group of products selected by the center for drug evaluation part of the nmpa 

in addition china’s human genetic resources administrative office strictly scrutinizes clinical trials involving the collection storage export and use of human genetic resources and relevant deriving data from the chinese population adding an extra layer of review in addition to that of the nmpa 

healthcare provider transparency and disclosures   a number of countries have implemented laws requiring or their industry associations have recommended disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers for example the efpia’s disclosure code requires all members including pfizer to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations 

intellectual property   the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2033 for leastdeveloped countries while we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world some countries have made improvements we include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries 

while the global intellectual property environment has generally improved following wtotrips and bilateralmultilateral trade agreements our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in emerging market countries in particular governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries considerable political and economic pressure exists to weaken current intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions eg new medical treatment methods revocation of patents issuance and threat of issuance of compulsory licenses weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries in developed countries as well including the eu we are facing an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment 

canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity currently eight years plus sixmonth pediatric extension but it lacks the predictability and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide through intense negotiations as part of the canadaeu comprehensive economic  trade agreement ceta canadian authorities have amended the patent medicines notice of compliance regulations to provide the innovator a right of appeal and canada now provides sui generis  protection for patent term extensions of up to two years for basic patents furthermore the usmexicocanada agreement usmca if ratified and implemented would establish 10 years of data protection for biologics and patent term adjustment for unreasonable or unnecessary delays in the grant of patents 

in china the intellectual property environment has improved although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with world trade organization provisions and several companies including pfizer have established rd centers in china due to increased confidence in china’s intellectual property environment despite this china remained on the us trade representative’s priority watch list for 2018 further the standards for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in other major markets including the us europe and japan also while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent for example the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage 

in brazil and other latin american countries the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents eg national health surveillance agency in brazil restrictive patentability rules ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions such as new medical uses of drug products may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products additionally an increased threat of issuance of compulsory licenses for biopharmaceutical products exists which adds to business uncertainty 

in india we have seen some progress in terms of expediting patent approval processes to reduce pendency rates and implementing training programs to enhance enforcement despite these positive steps gaps remain in terms of addressing longstanding intellectual property concerns for example policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents the tendency of the indian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings both pre and postgrant and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to safeguard many of our inventions and our investments in innovation these policies heighten the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population challenges against pfizer patents in india are ongoing 

environmental matters 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 a3  contingencies and certain commitments — legal proceedings––commercial and other matters  in our 2018  financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2018  for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

climate change presents risks to our operations including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers for example in 2017 our manufacturing and commercial operations in puerto rico were impacted by hurricanes for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our business — impact of hurricanes in puerto rico  section of the 2018  financial report we cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future however we have a program for reviewing our vulnerability to potential weatherrelated risks and we update our assessments periodically to date we have concluded that because of our facility locations our existing distribution networks and our controls we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on pfizer in the near term

risks related to our business industry and operations  

managed care trends 

private thirdparty payers and other managed care entities such as pharmacy benefit managers continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and control the cost of drugs consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private thirdparty payers private thirdparty payers as well as governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement failure to obtain or maintain timely adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our products or failure to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing could adversely impact revenue private thirdparty payers including selfinsured employers often implement formularies with copayment tiers to encourage utilization of certain drugs and have also been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products private thirdparty payers are also implementing new initiatives like socalled “copay accumulators” policies that provide that the value of copay assistance does not count as outofpocket costs that are applied toward deductibles that can shift more of the cost burden to manufacturers and patients this cost shifting has increased consumer interest and input in medication choices as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals private thirdparty payers also use additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing and valuebased pricingcontracting to improve their cost containment efforts private thirdparty payers also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us payer market consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues the date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires  however upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time which can adversely affect our business a number of our products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years in china for example we are expected to face strong competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2019 which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products 

also generic manufacturers have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents these include candidates that would compete with among other products eliquis xeljanz  and xtandi  our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or copromotion rights in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products including new product entrants inline branded products generic products private label products biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our inline drugs and drug candidates the introduction of competitive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of these have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

we also produce generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with products from competitors including other generic and biosimilar manufacturers the ability to launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before the anticipated formation of the generic or biosimilar marketplace is important to that product’s profitability prices for products typically decline sometimes dramatically following generic or biosimilar entry and as additional companies receive approvals to market that product competition intensifies if a company’s generic or biosimilar product can be “firsttomarket” such that its only competition is the branded drug for a period of time higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market with increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product market the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products will increase in importance our success will depend on our ability to bring new products to market quickly the fda along with other regulatory agencies around the world has been 



experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications which may result in delayed approvals of new generic products while the fda is taking steps to address the backlog of pending applications continued approval delays may be experienced by generic drug applicants over the next few years also we may face access challenges for our biosimilar products where our product may not receive appropriate formulary access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to the innovator product for example inflectraremsima  has experienced access challenges among commercial payers in september 2017 pfizer filed suit in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against johnson  johnson jj alleging that jj’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning remicade® infliximab violate federal antitrust laws

we recorded direct product andor alliance revenues of more than 1 billion for each of ten biopharmaceutical products in 2018 prevnar 13prevenar 13  lyrica  ibrance  eliquis  enbrel  lipitor  xeljanz  chantixchampix sutent  and norvasc  those products accounted for 51  of our total revenues in 2018  if these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection if applicable changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling pricing and access pressures supply shortages or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant a number of our current products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years including some of our billiondollar and previously billiondollar products and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are or have been the subject of pending legal challenges for example as a result of a patent litigation settlement teva pharmaceuticals usa inc launched a generic version of viagra  in the us in december 2017 in addition the basic product patent for lyrica  in the us will expire in june 2019 which includes the fda’s grant of pediatric exclusivity that extended the period of market exclusivity in the us for lyrica  for an additional six months from december 2018 in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights — recent losses and expected losses of product exclusivity   section in our 2018  financial report further our alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and copromotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity as well as to provide for earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers either through internal rd or through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties however balancing current growth investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge the average costs of product development continue to rise as do the regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas which may affect the number of candidates funded as well as the sustainability of the rd portfolio our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in rd for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth 

additionally our rd investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the scientific approach may not succeed for any given program despite the significant investment required for rd and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement 

we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the nearterm and over time these strategies may not deliver the desired result which could affect growth and profitability in the future 

biologic products 

abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in many international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biologic products our biologic products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow for example enbrel  faces ongoing biosimilar competition in most developed europe markets the expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant regulatory exclusivity period has expired we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biologic products 



we are developing biosimilar medicines risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity or as in the case of inflectraremsima  exclusionary contracting by the originator that leads to a lack of payer coverage and lower uptake coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products there is also a risk of lower uptake for biosimilars due to various factors that may vary for different biosimilars eg anticompetitive practices physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the originator product or misaligned financial incentives see also the competitive products risk factor above 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities if it receives regulatory approval for example a wider range of studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process however each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit the increased complexity of development and manufacturing and the potential delays to approval of the lead indication we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time the degree to which such potential challenges are foreseen and adequately addressed could affect our future results 

international operations 

our international operations could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls economic conditions expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of developed markets leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s global performance as a result we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets however our strategies in emerging markets may not be successful and these countries may not continue to sustain these growth rates for example even though china is growing faster than most emerging markets we face certain challenges in china due to government imposed pricing controls affecting certain pfizer medicines in addition some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending even though we constantly monitor the evolving emerging markets for any unanticipated risk to pfizer certain financial or political events in such markets as discussed above can adversely affect our results 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products has generated payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector the impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals is increasing for pfizer to date a number of factors create a more challenging paradigm given our growing specialty business portfolio these include formulary restrictions and increasing use of utilization management tools such as step edits which can lead to higher negotiated rebates or discounts to health plans and pbms in the us as well as the increasing use of health technology assessments in markets around the world 

consumer healthcare 

the consumer healthcare business may be impacted by economic volatility the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal reformulation andor relabeling of certain products eg coughcold products see consumer healthcare joint venture with gsk  and the global economic environment   risk factors below 

product manufacturing sales and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing sales or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions shutdowns work stoppages or strikes approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions or shortages reputational harm product liability unanticipated costs or otherwise examples of such difficulties or delays include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network andor comply with cgmps and 



other applicable regulations such as serialization which allows for track and trace of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety risks to supply chain continuity and commercial operations as a result of natural including hurricanes earthquakes and floods or manmade disasters including arson or terrorist attacks at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor including those that may be related to climate change or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration product diversion product theft counterfeit goods and cyberattacks 

regulatory agencies periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities to evaluate compliance with applicable cgmp requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions such as warning letters suspension of manufacturing seizure of product injunctions debarment voluntary recall of a product or failure to secure product approvals any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in february 2017 for example we received a warning letter from the fda communicating the fda’s view that certain violations of cgmp regulations exist at hospira’s manufacturing facility in mcpherson kansas we are undertaking corrective actions to address the concerns raised by the fda in january 2018 the fda upgraded the status of pfizer’s mcpherson manufacturing facility to vai based on an october 2017 inspection the change to vai status lifted the compliance hold that the fda placed on approval of pending applications in june 2018 the fda informed us that it had completed an evaluation of corrective actions and closed out the february 2017 warning letter issued to our mcpherson manufacturing facility after determining that we had addressed the violations contained in the warning letter in julyaugust 2018 the fda conducted a followup inspection of our mcpherson facility and issued an inspection report noting several findings pfizer responded to the fda’s findings and is in the process of implementing a corrective and preventive action plan to address the fda’s concerns on the basis of the julyaugust 2018 fda inspection the fda changed the inspection classification status of the mcpherson site to official action indicated oai future fda inspections and regulatory activities will further assess the adequacy and sustainability of these corrections communication with the fda on the status of the mcpherson site is ongoing as a result of this status the fda has refused and may continue to refuse to grant premarket approval of applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates related to products manufactured at our mcpherson site until the site status is upgraded which will require a successful reinspection by the fda the product shortages we have been experiencing within our portfolio are primarily for products from the legacy hospira portfolio and are largely driven by capacity constraints technical issues and supplier quality concerns we continue to remediate issues at legacy hospira facilities manufacturing sterile injectables any continuing product shortage interruption at these manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results specifically in our sterile injectable pharmaceuticals portfolio 

in addition in september 2017 meridian medical technologies inc a subsidiary of pfizer inc received a warning letter from the fda asserting the fda’s view that certain violations of cgmp and quality system regulations exist at meridian’s manufacturing sites in st louis missouri meridian responded to the warning letter and committed to making improvements across the sites we are undertaking corrective actions to address the concerns raised by the fda and communication with the fda is ongoing until the corrective actions are implemented and confirmed by the fda following a reinspection the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval of applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates related to products manufactured at our st louis sites 

outsourcing 

we outsource certain services to other parties including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial recruitment and execution clinical lab services nonclinical research safety services integrated facilities management and other areas outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables and potentially result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues erroneous data supply disruptions noncompliance including with applicable legal or regulatory requirements and industry standards andor reputational harm with potential negative effects on our results 

collaborations and other relationships with third parties   

we depend on thirdparty collaborators service providers and others in the research development manufacturing and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into joint ventures and other business development transactions in connection with our business to achieve expected longer term benefits we may make substantial upfront payments in such transactions which may negatively impact our reported earnings we rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development manufacturing and commercialization activities but we do not control many aspects of those activities third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual or other obligations to pfizer failure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any disruption in the relationships between pfizer and one or more of these third parties could delay or prevent the development approval manufacturing or commercialization of our products and product candidates and could also result in noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business 

biopharmaceutical wholesalers 

in 2018  our largest biopharmaceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately 15  of our total revenues and approximately 31  of our total us revenues and our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 37  of our total 



revenues and approximately 76  of our total us revenues if one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties such wholesaler might decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we might be unable to collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers including us 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through various forms of business development which can include alliances licenses joint ventures collaborations equity or debtbased investments dispositions divestments mergers and acquisitions however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated timeframes or at all and successfully integrate acquisitions pursuing these opportunities may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing and could result in increased leverage andor a downgrade of our credit ratings where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities such as in connection with our contribution agreement entered into with allogene therapeutics inc the value of those securities will fluctuate and may depreciate in value we may not control the company in which we acquire securities such as in connection with a divestiture or collaborative arrangement and as a result we will have limited ability to determine its management operational decisions and policies further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess legal proceedings or regulatory issues often arise as a result of activities that occurred at acquired companies their partners and other third parties in 2016 for example we paid 7846 million to resolve allegations related to wyeth’s reporting of prices to the government with respect to protonix for activities that occurred prior to our acquisition of wyeth for these and other reasons we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions and expected synergies and accretion may not be realized within the expected timeframes or at all 

counterfeit products 

a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicines can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual patients the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of underregulated wholesalers and repackagers the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facilities as counterfeit medicines are increasingly delivered direct to customers in small parcel packages the tendency to misuse and abuse medicines and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters compared to the large profits that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit medicines further laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

pfizer’s global reputation makes its medicines prime targets for counterfeiting organizations counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact our business by among other things causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation 

we undertake significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines including among other things working with the fda and other regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicines implementing business practices designed to protect patient health promoting public policies intended to hinder counterfeiting working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines working collaboratively with wholesalers pharmacies customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and repackagers and using data analytics and risk assessment tools to better target the factors that give rise to the counterfeiting problem in the first place however our efforts and the efforts of others may not be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase 



risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings  

pricing and reimbursement 

us and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls and limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies 

in the us many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform some states have implemented and other states are considering pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible there have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payments for pharmaceutical products including legislation on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented see the discussion regarding pricing and reimbursement in the item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — in the united states — pricing and reimbursement section   of this 2018  form 10k private thirdparty payers such as health plans increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing which could result in lower prices lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets healthcare provider purchasers directly or through group purchasing organizations are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in certain international markets such as the different eu member states japan china canada and south korea governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices access criteria eg through public or private health technology assessments or other means of cost control particularly under recent global financing pressures as a result we expect that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue 

the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our products or failure to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccines business we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business 

us healthcare reform 

the us healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes for example the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and established a major expansion of healthcare coverage financed in part by a number of new rebates discounts and taxes that had a significant effect on our expenses and profitability see the discussion under the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — regulatory environmentpricing and access––us healthcare legislation  section in our 2018  financial report and in item 1 business — government regulation and price constraints — in the united states  we face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca for example tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017 eliminates the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 the socalled “individual mandate” we anticipate continued congressional interest in modifying provisions of the aca particularly given the recent ruling in texas v azar  to invalidate the law as unconstitutional at this time the law remains in effect pending appeals of the decision given the outcomes of the 2018 us midterm elections with democrats taking over the us house of representatives and republicans growing their majority in the us senate we believe it is unlikely congress will find bipartisan consensus to advance any significant changes to the aca until the legal process unfolds the revenues generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion under the aca are not material so the impact of the change in law and similar recent administration actions is expected to be limited any future replacement modification or repeal of the aca may adversely affect our business and financial results particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employersponsored insurance coverage and we cannot predict how other future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business 

other us federal or state legislative or regulatory action andor policy efforts could adversely affect our business including among others general budget control actions changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries which is among the us presidential administration’s policy proposals revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government programs such as the implementation of international reference pricing for medicare part b drugs or changes to protected class criteria for part d drugs restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 



us entitlement reform 

in the us government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products the congressional budget office routinely releases options for reducing federal spending and the december 2018 release includes proposals to cap federal medicaid payments to the states and to require manufacturers to pay a minimum rebate on drugs covered under medicare part d for lowincome beneficiaries significant medicare reductions could also result if for example congress proceeds with certain proposals to convert the medicare feeforservice program into a premium support program or congress chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by the medicare payment advisory commission which are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of the medicare program these and any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

substantial regulation 

we are subject to extensive complex costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the us principally by the fda and the dea and foreign regulatory authorities failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution monetary penalties and other disciplinary actions including sanctions warning letters product seizures recalls fines injunctions suspension revocation of approvals corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements or exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs as well as reputational harm 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable  the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost the process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process including as the result of unfavorable preclinical and clinical trial results or unfavorable new clinical data and further analyses of existing clinical data including results that may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication we may not be able to meet anticipated preclinical or clinical endpoints commencement andor completion dates for our preclinical or clinical trials regulatory submission dates regulatory approval dates andor launch dates similarly we may not be able to successfully address all of the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the fda and the ema or obtain approval from regulators regulatory approval of drug or biologic products depends on myriad factors including a regulator making a determination as to whether a product’s benefits outweigh its known risks and a determination of the product’s efficacy additionally clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities even after a drug or biologic is approved it could be adversely affected by regulatory decisions impacting labeling manufacturing processes safety andor other matters we may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees such as the advisory committee on immunization practices that may impact the use of our vaccines for example during the october 2018 acip meeting the us centers for disease control and prevention presented initial data and indicated formal evaluation of evidence grading and a potential vote on the maintenance of the 65 years and older recommendation for prevnar 13 would likely happen in 2019 a potential adverse change in the acip recommendation would negatively impact future prevnar 13 revenues for additional information see the  analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — selected product discussion  section of our 2018 financial report further claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of inline products and product candidates can result in a negative impact on product sales product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the riskbenefit profile of products as they relate to alreadyapproved products has resulted in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for among other things additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements for these and other reasons discussed in item 1a risk factors  we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase 4 trials could result in the loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product regulatory agencies in countries outside the us often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products could implicate the entire class of products and this in turn could have an adverse effect on the availability or commercial viability of our products as well as other products in the class 



interactions with healthcare professionals and government officials 

risks and uncertainties apply if we provide offer or promise something of value to a healthcare professional other healthcare provider andor government official requirements or industry standards in the us and certain jurisdictions abroad that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions if an interaction is found to be improper government enforcement actions and penalties could result these risks may increase as both us and foreign enforcement agencies adopt or increase enforcement efforts in respect of existing and new laws and regulations governing product promotion marketing antibribery and kickbacks industry regulations and codes of conduct 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in laws and regulations including among others changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including tax rate changes new tax laws changes to existing tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory clarifications andor interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals including further clarifications andor interpretations of the tax cuts and jobs act competition laws privacy laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries for additional information see the provisionbenefit for taxes on income — changes in tax laws   and new accounting standards   sections and notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1 b   basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  adoption of new accounting standards in 2018  in our 2018  financial report 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including patent litigation such as claims that our patents are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer or where one or more third parties seeks damages andor injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities product liability and other productrelated litigation including personal injury consumer offlabel promotion securities antitrust and breach of contract claims commercial environmental government investigations employment tax litigation and other legal proceedings including various means for resolving asbestos litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all of our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations 

like other pharmaceutical companies we are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the us other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate as a result we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in addition in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government 

our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this 2018  form 10k as well as antikickback and false claims laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions like many companies in our industry we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as by consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries for example these claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

in connection with the resolution of a us government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to medicare patients in may 2018 we entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services which is effective for a period of five 



years in the cia we agreed to implement andor maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirements breaches of the cia could result in severe sanctions against us 

for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 a  contingencies and certain commitments — legal proceedings   in our 2018  financial report 

environmental claims and proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims and proceedings amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions  while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accruals for contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks related to intellectual property  

patent protection 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinct patent laws we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including among others claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term 

our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in policies or practices that may weaken its intellectual property framework eg a policy of routine compulsory licensing or threat of compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches that challenge our patent rights most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products processes or dosage forms are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of or attempts to enforce patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition andor violations of antitrust laws such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents we are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers payers governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry we also are often involved in other proceedings such as inter partes review postgrant review reexamination or opposition proceedings before the us patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others also if one of our patents is found to be invalid by such proceedings generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products for example several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and postgrant review proceedings in the us in june 2018 the patent trial and appeal board ruled on one patent holding that one claim was valid and that all other claims were invalid the party challenging that patent has appealed the decision challenges to other patents remain pending before the us patent and trademark office the invalidation of these patents could potentially allow a competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by 



requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

third party intellectual property claims 

a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted such challenges may include negotiation and litigation which may not always be successful 

part of our business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities which may involve litigation associated costs and time delays and may ultimately not be successful these opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired where patents have been declared invalid or where products do not infringe the patents of others to achieve a “firsttomarket” or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars we may take action such as litigation asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable 

third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and timeconsuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launches and may result in significant damages we are involved in patentrelated disputes with third parties over our attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic pharmaceuticals products or biosimilars we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings including any appeals have not been resolved ie “atrisk” launch if one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party such third party may be awarded significant damages or we may be prevented from further sales of that product such damages may be enhanced as much as threefold in the event that we or one of our subsidiaries like hospira is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party  any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

risk related to technology  

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our businesses in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including but not limited to personal information and intellectual property and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems and those of our thirdparty vendors with whom we contract and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal groups “hacktivists” nation states and others as a global pharmaceutical company our systems are subject to frequent attacks due to the nature of some of these attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology our efforts may not prevent service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 



risks related to our strategic transactions  

strategic acquisitions 

the success of any of our strategic acquisitions will depend in large part on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from combining these businesses with pfizer we for example may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with certain of these acquisitions or such cost savings within the expected time frame similarly the accretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisitions may not be realized or may be delayed integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business including thirdparty relationships or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies we also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control unsuccessful clinical trials regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates including those acquired in these acquisitions hospira for example has experienced manufacturing disruptions and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues manufacturing problems as well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our business — product manufacturing   section in our 2018  financial report 

consumer healthcare joint venture with gsk 

the required shareholder and regulatory approvals may not be obtained or the regulatory approvals may contain materially burdensome conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or the joint venture or the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all 

completion of the proposed transaction is subject to a number of conditions including among others the approval of gsk’s shareholders and the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and the receipt of all required approvals under the antitrust laws of certain other jurisdictions including the eu although pfizer and gsk have agreed to do all things necessary under applicable antitrust laws to complete the proposed transaction as promptly as reasonably practicable there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all or that the other conditions to closing will be satisfied in addition in connection with obtaining the required regulatory approvals governmental authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the proposed transaction or require changes to the terms of the proposed transaction if any such conditions or changes are imposed they may jeopardize or delay completion of the proposed transaction reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction or allow the parties to terminate the stock and asset purchase agreement which could negatively impact our stock price and our or the joint venture’s as applicable future business and financial results 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction 

the success of the proposed transaction will depend in part on the joint venture’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost synergies from the proposed transaction these anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time period the joint venture’s integration of pfizer’s and gsk’s consumer healthcare businesses may result in material unanticipated problems costs expenses liabilities competitive responses and loss of customer and other business relationships any material unanticipated issues arising from the integration process could negatively impact our stock price and our or the joint venture’s as applicable future business and financial results 

moreover uncertainty about the effect of the proposed transaction on employees customers suppliers distributors and other business partners may have an adverse effect on us and the joint venture these uncertainties may impair our andor the joint venture’s ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the transaction is consummated and for a period of time thereafter and could cause customers suppliers distributors and others who deal with us andor the joint venture to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us andor the joint venture or fail to renew existing relationships employee retention may be challenging during the pendency of the proposed transaction as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles if key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined business our business and the business of the joint venture following the completion of the transaction could be adversely affected 

following the integration of the combined business gsk intends to separate the joint venture as an independent company via a demerger of its equity interest to its shareholders and a listing of the combined business on the uk equity market gsk will have the sole right to decide whether and when to initiate a separation and listing for a period of five years from closing of the proposed transaction gsk may also sell all or part of its stake in the joint venture in a contemporaneous initial public offering should a separation and listing occur during the first five years after closing pfizer has the option to participate through the distribution of some or all of its equity interest in the joint venture to its shareholders following a separation or listing and subject to customary lockup or similar restrictions pfizer will also have the ability to sell its equity interest in the joint venture through the capital markets after the fifth anniversary of the closing of the proposed transaction both gsk and pfizer will have the right to decide whether and when to initiate a separation and public listing of the joint venture the planned separation and 



public listing transactions may not be initiated or completed within the expected time periods or at all and both the timing and success of any separation and public listing transaction as well as the value generated for pfizer or its shareholders in any such transaction will be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such transaction although pfizer is entitled to participate in any separation and listing transaction initiated by gsk during the first five years after closing it is not required to do so and any future distribution or sale of pfizer’s equity stake in the joint venture will similarly be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such transaction pfizer’s ability to complete any such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the size of pfizer’s retained equity stake at the time the uncertainty relating to the separation and public listing transactions their implementation their timing and their yet to be determined effects on the joint venture’s business may subject us and the joint venture to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business and financial results 

the joint venture may be subject to additional risks beyond those associated with pfizer’s consumer healthcare business 

after completion of the transaction the joint venture will be subject to the risks associated with gsk’s consumer healthcare business in addition to the risks associated with pfizer’s consumer healthcare business and the business financial condition and results of operations of the joint venture may be affected by factors that are different from or in addition to those currently affecting the independent business financial condition and results of operations of pfizer’s consumer healthcare business many of these factors are outside of our and the joint venture’s control and could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the joint venture moreover although we will have certain consent board representation and other governance rights with respect to the joint venture pfizer will be a minority owner of the joint venture following the completion of the proposed transaction as a result pfizer will not have control over the joint venture its management or its policies and we may have business interests strategies and goals that differ in certain respects from those of gsk or the joint venture 

the market value of our common stock may be adversely affected as a result of expected and unexpected costs associated with the proposed transaction and integration of the businesses 

we have incurred and expect to incur transaction and integrationrelated costs in connection with the proposed transaction we expect that a substantial portion of these transaction and integrationrelated costs will be comprised of nonrecurring fees for professional services to complete the proposed transaction facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs although certain unanticipated costs and expenses may be incurred as well if the stock and asset purchase agreement is terminated we would have incurred many of these costs fees and expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the transaction these costs fees and expenses could adversely affect our financial results 

other risks 

the global economic environment 

like all businesses of our size we are exposed to both global and industryspecific economic conditions governments corporations and insurance companies which provide insurance benefits to patients have implemented increases in costsharing and restrictions on access to medicines potentially causing patients to switch to generic or biosimilar products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments government financing pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices access criteria eg through public or private health technology assessments or other means of cost control examples include the different eu member states japan china canada south korea and a number of other international markets the us continues to maintain competitive insurance markets but has also seen significant increases in patient costsharing and growing government influence as government programs continue to grow as a source of coverage 

the global economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources due to our significant operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions but there can be no guarantee that changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources or impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

we continue to monitor credit capital restrictions and economic situations in volatile regions and markets especially where the ability to obtain us dollars for local currency is unpredictable and challenging we cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in these economic conditions or what impact they may have on our results of operations financial condition or business 

in addition given that a significant portion of our business is conducted in the eu including the uk the formal change in the relationship between the uk and the eu caused by brexit may pose certain implications for our research commercial and general business operations in the uk and the eu including the approval and supply of our products details on how brexit will be executed and the impact on the remaining eu countries will dictate how and whether the broader eu will be impacted 



and what the resulting impact on our business may be for additional information see the see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our operating environment — the global economic environment   section in our 2018  financial report 

we also continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments if trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economic activity or if other factors lead to a general economic downturn potential impacts could include declining sales increased costs volatility in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments required increases of our pension funding obligations increased government cost control efforts delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

foreign exchange and interest rate risk 

significant portions of our revenues costs and expenses as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 53  of our total 2018  revenues were derived from international operations including 21  from europe and 22  from china japan and the rest of asia as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the uk pound the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses if the us dollar were to weaken against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would increase having a positive impact on earnings and our overall expenses would increase having a negative impact on earnings conversely if the us dollar were to strengthen against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would decrease having a negative impact on earnings and our overall expenses would decrease having a positive impact on earnings therefore significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations including venezuela and argentina can impact our results and financial guidance  for additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our financial guidance for   2019  and analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources   sections in our 2018  financial report 

in addition our interestbearing investments and borrowings and our pension benefit obligations net and our postretirement benefit obligations net are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks related to interestbearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section in our 2018  financial report for additional details see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7 f  financial instruments  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and — note 11  pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans   in our 2018  financial report and the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions ––benefit plans  section in our 2018  financial report those sections of our 2018  financial report are incorporated by reference 

from time to time we issue variable rate debt based on libor or undertake interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor there is currently uncertainty around whether libor will continue to exist after 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to amend certain agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected additionally uncertainty as to the nature of a potential discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks for additional information see analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources — selected measures of liquidity and capital resources — libor  

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

market fluctuations in our equity investments 

in the first quarter of 2018 we adopted a new accounting standard whereby certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value now recognized in net income we expect the adoption of this new accounting standard may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments for additional information see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1 b   basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  adoption of new accounting standards in 2018  and the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  sections in our 2018  financial report 



our pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations net of our plan assets are subject to volatility from changes in fair value of equity investments and other investment risk for additional information see notes to consolidated financial statements— note 11 pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans and the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions — benefit plans section in our 2018 financial report 

cost and expense controlunusual eventsfailure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitions 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings internal reorganizations product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of i our costreduction and productivity initiatives ii the reorganization of our commercial operations into three businesses effective at the beginning of the company’s 2019 fiscal year iii any other corporate strategic initiatives and iv any acquisitions divestitures or other initiatives such as our proposed transaction with gsk to combine our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture 

intangible assets goodwill and equitymethod investments 

our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future if the associated rd effort is abandoned the related iprd assets will likely be writtenoff and we will record an impairment charge for goodwill all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity any such charge may be significant our other intangible assets including developed technology rights and brands face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assets may be significant as well for additional details see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions  section in our 2018  financial report 

we also regularly review our equitymethod investments for impairment an impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments we may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment events related to particular customers or asset types challenging market conditions or decisions by management 

internal control over financial reporting 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures could undermine the ability to provide accurate disclosure including with respect to financial information on a timely basis which could cause investors to lose confidence in our disclosures including with respect to financial information require significant resources to remediate the lapse or deficiency and expose us to legal or regulatory proceedings 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas

research and development 

our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs 

our rd priorities and strategy 

our rd priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies and vaccines with the greatest medical and commercial potential advancing our capabilities that can position pfizer for longterm leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity to that end our research and development primarily focuses on 

 

in january 2018 we announced our decision to end internal neuroscience discovery and early development efforts and reallocate funding to other areas where we have stronger scientific leadership we plan to create a dedicated neuroscience venture fund to support continued efforts to advance the field the development of tanezumab and potential treatments for rare neuromuscular disorders is not impacted by this decision 

while a significant portion of rd is done internally we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines by entering into collaborations alliances and license agreements with other companies as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity or debtbased investments we also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of the development costs of one of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments revenue sharing payments profit sharing payments andor royalties for additional information on these collaborations agreements and investments see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our strategy — description of research and development operations section in our 2017 financial report 

our rd operations 

we conduct rd internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time 

our rd spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations research units within our worldwide research and development wrd organization are generally responsible for research and earlystage development assets for our ih business assets that have not yet achieved proofofconcept our sciencebased and other platformservices organizations where a significant portion of our rd spending occurs provide endtoend scientific and technical expertise and other services to the various rd projects and are organized into sciencebased functions which are part of our wrd organization such as pharmaceutical sciences medicinal chemistry regulatory and drug safety and nonsciencebased functions such as facilities business technology and finance our rd organization within the eh business supports the large base of eh products and is expected to develop potential new sterile injectable drugs and therapeutic solutions as well as biosimilars our global product development organization is a unified center for latestage development for our innovative products and is generally responsible for the operational execution of clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our wrd and innovative portfolios 

for discussion regarding these rd matrix organizations and additional information on our rd operations see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our strategy — description of research and development operations and  costs and expenses — research and development rd expenses  sections in our 2017  financial report 

our rd pipeline and competition 

innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable according to the pharmaceutical benchmarking forum out of 17 compounds entering preclinical development on average only one is approved by a regulatory authority in a major market us the eu or japan the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development 

as of january 30 2018  we had the following number of projects in various stages of rd 

development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs while these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products in addition to discovering and developing new products our rd efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income—product developments — biopharmaceutical  section in our 2017  financial report which is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to rd we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence in addition several of our competitors operate without large rd expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration for additional information see the competition  and item 1a risk factors — competitive products  sections below 



international operations 

we have significant operations outside the us operations in developed and emerging markets are managed through our two business segments ih and eh emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastestgrowing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets 

we sell our products in over 125 countries revenues from operations outside the us of 265 billion  accounted for 50  of our total revenues in 2017  by total revenues japan and china are our two largest national markets outside the us for a geographic breakdown of revenues see the table captioned geographic information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  in our 2017  financial report and the table captioned revenues by segment and geography  in our 2017  financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

our international operations are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries including among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations and expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors — risks affecting international operations  below our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws and regulations on pricing reimbursement and access to our products see government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states  below for a discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments depending upon market conditions for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7f financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2017  financial report as well as the  forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section in our 2017  financial report those sections of our 2017  financial report are incorporated by reference 



marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical businesses we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants and pharmacists managed care organizations that provide insurance coverage such as hospitals integrated delivery systems pharmacy benefit managers and health plans and employers and government agencies who hire mcos to provide health benefits to their employees we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies and in the case of our vaccines products in the us we primarily sell directly to the centers for disease control and prevention wholesalers and individual provider offices we seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and mco formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos mcos use various benefit designs such as tiered copays for formulary products to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions we also work with mcos to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

in 2017  our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 38  of our total revenues and approximately 79  of our total us revenues 

 of 2017  total revenues and us revenues from 

major biopharmaceutical wholesalers and other customers 

our global consumer healthcare business uses its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products and occasionally uses distributors and agents principally in smaller markets the advertising and promotions for our consumer healthcare business are generally disseminated to consumers through television print digital and other media advertising as well as through instore promotion consumer healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies retail chains and grocery and convenience stores our consumer healthcare business generates a significant portion of its sales from several large customers the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the consumer healthcare business 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance to pfizer trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country further patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product for additional information see government regulation and price constraints—intellectual property below 

in various markets a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided to certain therapeutics upon approval the scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but in general the period of regulatory exclusivity will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the therapeutic 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period andor the granted patent term extension are those for the medicines set forth in the table below unless otherwise indicated the years set forth in the table below pertain to the basic product patent expiration for the respective products patent term extensions supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below unless they have been granted by the issuing authority in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions to methods of manufacturing or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect our drug from generic or as applicable biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent 



 

a number of our current products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years for additional information including a description of certain of our expired copromotion agreements and a further discussion of our products experiencing or expected to experience in 2018  patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the us europe or japan see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights section in our 2017  financial report and item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products below 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents these include candidates that would compete with among other products xeljanz  and xtandi    we also are often involved in other proceedings such as inter partes review postgrant review reexamination or opposition proceedings before the us patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a1 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—patent litigation  in our 2017  financial report 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms or conversion of the active ingredient to otc products 

biotechnology products 

our biotechnology products including benefix  refacto  xyntha  bavencio  prevnar 13prevenar 13  and enbrel  we market enbrel  outside the us and canada may face in the future or already face competition from biosimilars also referred to as followon biologics in the us such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a followon recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin  which was approved under the ffdca 

biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and to have no clinically meaningful differences biosimilars have the potential to offer highquality lowercost alternatives to biologic medicines abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage in 2010 of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us 

in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years 

as part of our business strategy we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths to develop biosimilar medicines see item 1a risk factors — biotechnology products  below 

we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products likewise as we develop and manufacture biosimilars and seek to launch products patents may be asserted against us 

international 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased biopharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products 

this competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in rd as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also seek to continually 



enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs we believe that we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines for example prevnar 13  may face competition in the form of alternative 13valent or additional valent nextgeneration pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents which may adversely affect our future results 

our generics and biosimilars businesses compete with branded products from competitors as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers globally pfizer sells generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain competitors’ solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products as well as biosimilars we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “firsttomarket” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars as a “firsttomarket” position provides customers a lowercost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with potentially higher levels of sales and profitability until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market 

our consumer healthcare business faces competition from otc business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies and retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources customer acceptance product quality our and our competitors’ introduction of new products ingredients claims dosage forms or other forms of innovation and pricing regulatory and legislative matters such as product labeling patient access and prescription to otc switches 

managed care organizations 

the evolution of managed care in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 291 million people in the us now have some form of health insurance coverage due to the expansion of health insurance coverage see government regulation and price constraints — in the united states  below the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the us continues to grow in importance 

the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate as well as their importance to pfizer 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures mcos typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine volume purchasing longterm contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs in addition by placing branded medicines on highertier status in their formularies leading to higher patient copays or nonpreferred tier status mcos transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient resulting in significant outofpocket expenses for the patient especially for chronic treatments this financial disincentive is a tool for mcos to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the mcos mcos also use additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing copay accumulator programs and valuebased pricingcontracting to improve their cost containment efforts we are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them 

due to their generally lower cost generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of mco formularies the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos are currently evaluating the appropriate placement of biosimilars on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies however increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a nonpreferred status 



mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

the aca has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes under the trump administration there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the aca although the current likelihood of repeal of the aca appears low given the failure of the senate’s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of aca provisions we are monitoring any such actions to see if any changes to the aca will be enacted that would impact our business 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time several competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration generic competitors often operate without large rd expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic competitors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute for brandname drugs generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs in a small subset of states prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources in 2017  we experienced periodic shortages of select materials due to constrained capacity or operational challenges with the associated suppliers supplier management activities are ongoing to work to ensure the necessary supply to meet our requirements for these materials no significant impact to our operations is anticipated in 2018 

government regulation and price constraints 

pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business certain laws and regulations that govern pfizer’s business are discussed below 

general   our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our products could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmental bodies for additional information on these proceedings and actions see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings  in our 2017  financial report criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties warning letters and product recalls or seizures delays in product approvals as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions could result from such proceedings and actions 

in the united states 

drug regulation   in the us biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre and postmarket regulations by the fda including regulations that govern the testing manufacturing safety efficacy labeling and storage of our products record keeping advertising and promotion our products are also subject to postmarket surveillance under the ffdca and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs as well as the public health service act and its implementing regulations with respect to biologics the fda also regulates our consumer healthcare products 

other us federal agencies including the dea also regulate certain of our products the us federal trade commission has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products including otc drugs and dietary supplements many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec 

before a new biopharmaceutical product may be marketed in the us the fda must approve an nda for a new drug or a bla for a biologic the steps required before the fda will approve an nda or bla generally include preclinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the study sponsor sponsor submission of the application to the fda for review the fda’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness and the fda’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured 

before a generic drug may be marketed in the us the fda must approve an anda the anda review process typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the referenced drug previously approved through the nda process the anda process however does require the sponsor to conduct one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the anda drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved referenced brand drug submission of an application to the fda for review and the fda’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured 

as a condition of product approval the fda may require a sponsor to conduct postmarketing clinical studies known as phase 4 studies and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of the approved product the fda may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarket studies and programs any modifications to a drug or biologic including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities may require the submission and approval of a new or supplemental nda or bla before the modification can be implemented which may require that we develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs and biologics is subject to continuing regulation by the fda including recordkeeping requirements reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product and adherence to cgmps which regulate all aspects of the manufacturing process we are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics including but not limited to standards and regulations for directtoconsumer advertising failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions including warning letters product recalls or seizures delays in product approvals injunctions fines civil penalties andor criminal prosecution 

biosimilar regulation  the aca created a framework for the approval of biosimilars also known as followon biologics following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic 

the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars through those approvals and the issuance of draft and final guidance the fda has begun to address open questions about the naming convention for biosimilars and the use of data from a nonuslicensed comparator to demonstrate biosimilarity andor interchangeability with a uslicensed reference product over the next several years the fda is expected to issue additional draft and final guidance documents impacting biosimilars in addition in 2017 the biosimilar user fee act was reauthorized for a fiveyear period which should lead to a significant increase in the fda’s biosimilar user fee revenues thereby providing the fda with additional resources to process biosimilar applications also there have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca while none of those efforts have focused on changes to the provisions of the aca related to the biosimilar regulatory framework if those efforts continue in 2018 and if the aca is repealed substantially modified or invalidated it is unclear what if any impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation 

sales and marketing   the marketing practices of us biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs these laws include antikickback laws and false claims laws antikickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business including the purchase or prescription of a particular product false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented any claims for payment for goods including drugs or services to thirdparty payers including medicare and medicaid that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions andor exclusion from federal healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid the federal government and various states also have enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies the laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of such interactions andor require the adoption of compliance standards or programs many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations 

pricing and reimbursement   pricing for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program the 340b drug pricing program and the medicare part d program pfizer must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program and medicare part b the calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose pfizer to penalties see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview section in our 2017  financial report and in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1g basis of presentation and significant accounting policies revenues and trade accounts receivable in our 2017  financial report which are incorporated by reference 

government and private thirdparty payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products for example the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under medicaid restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states as another example access to our products under the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans with which state medicaid agencies contract to provide services to medicaid beneficiaries given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises a growing number of states are considering a variety of costcontrol strategies including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers who are the primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products in the us will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers including us 

efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products including legislation on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented recently there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals there have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices recent legislation enacted includes for example a 2017 maryland law that prohibits a generic drug manufacturer or wholesale distributor from engaging in price gouging in the sale of certain offpatent or generic drugs and a 2017 california law that requires manufacturers to provide advanced notification of price increases to certain purchasers and report specified drug pricing information to the state   certain state legislation like the maryland law has been subject to legal challenges  

adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand for or pricing of our products we believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we will continue to work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes lower costs to the healthcare system and ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system 

healthcare reform  the us and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry for example in march 2010 the us congress enacted the aca that expanded healthcare coverage through medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual health insurance exchanges and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs 

under president trump’s administration there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the aca although the current likelihood of repeal of the aca appears low given the failure of the senate’s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of aca provisions in october 2017 the president signed an executive order directing federal agencies to look for ways to authorize more health plans that could be less expensive because the plans would not have to meet all of the aca’s coverage requirements and announced that his administration will withhold the costsharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchange plans serving lowincome enrollees in december 2017 the comprehensive tax reform package signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act includes a provision that effectively repealed the aca’s individual mandate by removing the penalties these and similar actions by the administration are widely expected to lead to fewer americans having comprehensive acacompliant health insurance even in the absence of a full legislative repeal the revenues generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchanges under the aca are minor so the impact of the recent administration actions is expected to be limited we also may face uncertainties if our industry is looked to for savings to fund certain legislation such as lifting the debt ceiling one recent example is the bipartisan budget act of 2018 which increased the discount we pay in the medicare part d coverage gap from 50 to 70 which will modestly reduce our future medicare part d revenues 

we cannot predict the ultimate content timing or effect of any changes to the aca or other federal and state reform efforts there is no assurance that federal or state healthcare reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results 

anticorruption   the fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries 

new drug approvals  in the eu the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the mutual recognition procedure the decentralized procedure or the eu centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the european economic area countries norway iceland and liechtenstein the centralized procedure managed by the ema results in one single authorization for the whole eu which provides the most rapid and efficient means of gaining approval across the eu and is the one most commonly used for new products 

in japan the pmda is the point of entry for businesses looking to sell drugs in the country the pmda which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities including clinical studies approvals postmarketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety must approve an application before a new drug product may be marketed in japan the pmda also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals 

historically china’s regulatory system has presented numerous challenges for the pharmaceutical industry as its requirements for drug development and registration have not always been consistent with us or other international standards the cfda however has introduced reforms and draft reforms in recent years which are discussed in more detail below that attempt to address these challenges with 2017 being an especially active year in this respect in the past it has been common to see treatments entering the chinese market two to eight years behind first marketing in the us and europe because historically china has only issued import drug licenses to treatments approved by mature regulatory authorities such as the fda or the ema in addition to obtain marketing approvals for new drugs in china a clinical trial authorization issued by the cfda has historically been required for the conduct of phase i to iii clinical trials applications for approval of imported drugs that included chinaoriginated data in their multiregional clinical trials and met the relevant technical review requirements were allowed to receive local clinical trial waivers on a casebycase basis historically oral generics only had to undergo bioequivalence studies upon a filing for record with the cfda while sterile injectable generics often needed local confirmatory trials for regulatory approval a chinese drug license would only be granted if following review the cfda determines that the clinical data confirm the drug’s safety and effectiveness 

health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority ie similar to the authority of the fda or the ema before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval these requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the us and europe 

pharmacovigilance   in the eu there is detailed legislation and guidance on pharmacovigilance which has been increased and strengthened in recent years the ema’s pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the eu authorities eu regulators may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization safety and efficacy studies at the time of approval or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products outside developed markets such as the eu and japan pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive but there is a trend toward increasing regulation 

pricing and reimbursement  in europe japan china canada south korea and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at lowtozero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global economic pressures governments including the different eu member states may use a variety of costcontainment measures for our pharmaceutical products including price cuts mandatory rebates health technology assessments and international reference pricing ie the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries this international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in different countries varying health outcomes and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

in particular international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and can hinder patient access and innovation price variations exacerbated by international reference pricing systems also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries 

in addition several important multilateral organizations such as the united nations un and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations eg 2016 un high level panel report on access to medicines  and 2017 oecd report on new health technologies — managing access value and sustainability  government adoption of these recommendations may lead to additional pricing pressures 

in japan the government recently released a basic framework for pharmaceutical pricing that will lead to the adoption of cost effectiveness assessments in some form quarterly pricing reviews for new indications and severe narrowing of the criteria to gain a price maintenance premium in china despite removal of governmentset price caps the government continues to exercise indirect price control by setting reimbursement standards through a negotiation mechanism between drug manufacturers and social insurance administrations provincial biddings crossregional procurement and secondary hospital price negotiations are likely to intensify as government cost containment efforts continue 

eu regulatory changes   the eu adopted a new clinical trials regulation in may 2014 which is expected to come into effect some time in late 2019 this regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the eu and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results 

under its publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use policy the ema proactively publishes clinical trial data from application dossiers for new marketing authorizations including data from trials taking place outside the eu after the ema has made a decision on the marketing authorization the policy includes limited exceptions for commercially confidential information and the exclusion of any protected personal data 

brexit  in june 2016 the uk electorate voted in a referendum to leave the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government formally notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu after it triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty to begin the twoyear negotiation process establishing the terms of the exit and outlining the future relationship between the uk and the eu formal negotiations officially started in june 2017 this process continues to be highly complex and the end result of these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research commercial and general business operations in the uk and the eu including the approval and supply of our products it was announced in november 2017 that the ema will be relocating from london uk to amsterdam netherlands by the expected date of brexit in march 2019 at present it is still unclear whether and to what extent the uk will remain within or aligned to the eu system of medicines regulation andor what separate requirements will be imposed in the uk after it leaves the eu for additional information on brexit see the analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources — global economic conditions — uk in our 2017 financial report  

china regulatory changes   in an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlogs for existing applications for drug approval the cfda has unveiled numerous reform initiatives for china’s drug approval system and engaged in significant efforts to build its capabilities the cfda now divides drugs into new drugs and generics with the definition for new drugs changed from “china new” to “global new” this means that drugs previously approved in other markets such as the us or europe will not be considered new drugs under china’s regulatory regime with the exception of drugs introduced within one year of approval in mature markets this change in definition creates more opportunities for china’s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms because multinational firms have historically had significant competitive advantage in successfully achieving regulatory approvals for drugs first approved outside of china the 2017 revisions made clear however that regulatory approval from the fda or the ema would no longer be required for approval of imported drugs though a notable exception persists for imported vaccines which still require prior approval from a relevant regulatory agency the “marketing authorization holder” system which will allow for more flexibility in contract manufacturing arrangements and asset transfers now applies to all drugs developed and manufactured in china but not yet to imported drugs 

while challenges remain a number of other policy changes are streamlining and accelerating approvals of domestic and imported drugs in china these reforms along with china’s june 2017 entry into the international council for harmonisation of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use are expected to pave the way for integration of cfda’s regulations with global practices these changes include introducing an umbrella clinical trial authorization for all three phases of registration studies instead of the original phasebyphase approvals a filingrecordation system for bioequivalence studies on generics instead of the original review and approval system admitting more categories of drugs as innovative drugs eligible for the fast track“green channel” approval pathway and ongoing implementation of previously announced regulatory reforms 

healthcare provider transparency and disclosures   a number of countries have implemented laws requiring or their industry associations have recommended disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers for example the efpia’s disclosure code requires all members including pfizer to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations 

intellectual property   the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2033 for leastdeveloped countries while we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world some countries have made improvements we include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries 

while the global intellectual property environment has generally improved following wtotrips and bilateralmultilateral trade agreements our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in emerging market countries in particular governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries there is considerable political and economic pressure to weaken existing intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions eg new medical treatment methods revocation of patents issuance and threat of issuance of compulsory licenses weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries in developed countries as well including the eu we are facing an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment 

canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity eight years plus sixmonth pediatric extension but it lacks the predictability and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide through intense negotiations as part of the canadaeu comprehensive economic  trade agreement ceta canadian authorities reluctantly agreed to introduce a right of appeal a form of patent term restoration and to elevate the current data protection to a treaty obligation further aligning its intellectual property regime to the eu in particular ceta article 2025 provides sui generis  protection for patent term extensions of two to five years for basic patents subject to various rules and limitations 

in china the intellectual property environment has improved although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with world trade organization provisions and several companies including pfizer have established rd centers in china due to increased confidence in china’s intellectual property environment despite this china remained on the us trade representative’s priority watch list for 2017 further the standards for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in other major markets including the us europe and japan also while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent for example the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage 

in brazil and other latin american countries the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents eg national health surveillance agency in brazil restrictive patentability rules ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions such as new medical uses of drug products may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products 

in india we have seen some progress in terms of expediting patent approval processes to reduce pendency rates and implementing training programs to enhance enforcement despite these positive steps gaps remain in terms of addressing longstanding intellectual property concerns for example policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents the tendency of the indian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings both pre and postgrant and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to safeguard many of our inventions and our investments in innovation these policies heighten the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population challenges against pfizer patents in india are ongoing 

environmental matters 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a3 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—commercial and other matters  in our 2017  financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2017  for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

climate change presents risks to our operations including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers for example in 2017 our manufacturing and commercial operations in puerto rico were impacted by hurricanes for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our business — impact of recent hurricanes in puerto rico  section of the 2017 financial report we cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future however we have a program for reviewing our vulnerability to potential weatherrelated risks and we update our assessments periodically to date we have concluded that because of our facility locations our existing distribution networks and our controls we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on pfizer in the near term

employees 

in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 90200  people in our operations throughout the world 



disclosure pursuant to section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

section 219 of iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra requires disclosure by public companies of certain transactions involving the government of iran as well as entities and individuals designated under executive order 13382 and executive order 13224 the executive orders in some instances itrshra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they were permissible under us law or were conducted by a nonus affiliate in accordance with the local law under which such entity operates 

as a global biopharmaceutical company we conduct business in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world during 2017  our activities included supplying lifesaving medicines medical products and consumer products pfizer products for patient and consumer use in iran we ship pfizer products to iran and conduct related activities in accordance with licenses issued by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and other us and nonus governmental entities and in line with our corporate policies we will continue our global activities to improve the health and wellbeing of patients and consumers in a manner consistent with applicable laws and our corporate policies to our knowledge none of our activities during 2017  are required to be disclosed pursuant to itrshra

risks related to our business industry and operations  

managed care trends 

consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private insurers private thirdparty insurers as well as governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue in addition to formulary tier copay differentials private health insurance companies and selfinsured employers have been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products they are also trying newer programs like copay accumulators to shift more of the cost burden to manufacturers and patients this cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medication choices as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals mcos also use additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing and valuebased pricingcontracting to improve their cost containment efforts private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us payer market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues the date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time which can adversely affect our business a number of our products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years 

also generic manufacturers have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents these include candidates that would compete with among other products xeljanz  and xtandi  our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or copromotion rights in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products including new product entrants inline branded products generic products private label products biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our inline drugs and drug candidates the introduction of competitive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

we also produce generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with products from competitors including other generic and biosimilar manufacturers the ability to launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before the anticipated formation of the generic or biosimilar marketplace is important to that product’s profitability prices for products typically decline sometimes dramatically following generic or biosimilar entry and as additional companies receive approvals to market that product competition intensifies if a company’s generic or biosimilar product can be “firsttomarket” such that its only competition is the branded drug for a period of time higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market with increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product market the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products will increase in importance our success will depend on our ability to bring new products to market quickly also we may face access challenges for our biosimilar products where our product may not receive access at parity to the innovator product and remains in a disadvantaged position for example inflectraremsima  has experienced access challenges among commercial payers in september 2017 pfizer filed suit in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against johnson  johnson jj alleging that jj’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning remicade® infliximab violate federal antitrust laws

we recorded direct product andor alliance revenues of more than 1 billion for each of nine biopharmaceutical products in 2017 prevnar 13prevenar 13  lyrica  ibrance  eliquis  enbrel  lipitor  xeljanz  viagra and sutent  those products accounted for 46  of our total revenues in 2017  if these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection if applicable changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling access pressures or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years including some of our billiondollar and previously billiondollar products and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are or have been the subject of pending legal challenges for example as a result of a patent litigation settlement teva pharmaceuticals usa inc launched a generic version of viagra  in the us in december 2017 in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights — recent losses and expected losses of product exclusivity section in our 2017  financial report 

further our alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and copromotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time for additional information on recent losses of collaborations rights see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights — recent losses of collaboration rights section in our 2017  financial report 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity as well as to provide for earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers either through internal rd or through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties however balancing current growth investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge the average costs of product development continue to rise as do the regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas which may affect the number of candidates funded as well as the sustainability of the rd portfolio our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in rd for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth 

additionally our rd investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipeline could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the science may not work for any given program despite the significant investment required for rd and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement 

we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time there can be no assurance that these strategies will deliver the desired result which could affect profitability in the future 

biotechnology products 

abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow for example enbrel  faces ongoing biosimilar competition in most developed europe markets which is expected to continue the expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant regulatory exclusivity period has expired we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products 

we are developing biosimilar medicines the evolving pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products by the fda and regulatory authorities in certain other countries could diminish the value of our investments in biosimilars other risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products there is also a risk of lower prescriptions for biosimilars due to potential concerns over comparability with innovator medicines see also the competitive products risk factor above 



research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities if it receives regulatory approval for example a wider range of studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process however each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit the increased complexity of development and the potential delays to approval of the lead indication we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time the degree to which such potential challenges are foreseen and addressed could affect our future results 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of developed markets leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s global performance as a result we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets however there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that these countries will continue to sustain these growth rates in addition some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending even though we constantly monitor the evolving emerging markets for any unanticipated risk to pfizer certain financial or political events in such markets as discussed above can adversely affect our results 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products has generated payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector the impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals is increasing for pfizer to date a number of factors create a more challenging paradigm given our growing specialty business portfolio these include formulary restrictions and dispensation barriers such as step edits leading to higher negotiated rebates or discounts to health plans and pbms in the us as well as the increasing use of health technology assessments in markets around the world 

consumer healthcare 

the consumer healthcare business may be impacted by economic volatility the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal reformulation andor relabeling of certain products eg coughcold products see the global economic environment  and strategic alternatives for pfizer consumer healthcare risk factors below 

product manufacturing sales and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing sales or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions shutdowns approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions or shortages reputational harm product liability unanticipated costs or otherwise examples of such difficulties or delays include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network andor comply with cgmps and other applicable regulations such as serialization which allows for track and trace of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety risks to supply chain continuity and commercial operations as a result of natural including hurricanes earthquakes and floods or manmade disasters at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor including those that may be related to climate change or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration product diversion product theft counterfeit goods and cyberattacks 

regulatory agencies periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities to evaluate compliance with applicable cgmp requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions such as warning letters suspension of manufacturing seizure of product injunctions debarment or voluntary recall of a product any of 



which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in february 2017 we received a warning letter from the fda communicating the fda’s view that certain violations of cgmp regulations exist at hospira’s manufacturing facility in mcpherson kansas we are undertaking corrective actions to address the concerns raised by the fda in january 2018 the fda upgraded the status of pfizer’s mcpherson kansas manufacturing facility to voluntary action indicated vai based on an october 2017 inspection the change to vai status will lift the compliance hold that the fda placed on approval of pending applications and is an important step toward resolving the issues cited in the february 2017 fda warning letter in addition in september 2017 meridian a subsidiary of pfizer inc received a warning letter from the fda asserting the fda’s view that certain violations of cgmp and quality system regulations exist at meridian’s manufacturing sites in st louis missouri we are undertaking corrective actions to address the concerns raised by the fda and communication with the fda is ongoing until the corrective actions are implemented and approved by the fda the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval of applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates related to products manufactured at our st louis missouri sites 

outsourcing and enterprise resource planning 

we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial execution clinical lab services nonclinical research safety services integrated facilities management and other areas for example in 2017 we placed the majority of our clinical trial execution services with four clinical research organizations cros service performance issues with these cros may adversely impact the progression of our clinical trial programs outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables which may result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues erroneous data supply disruptions noncompliance including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards or reputational harm with potential negative implications for our results 

we are migrating to a consistent enterprise resource planning system across the organization these are enhancements of ongoing activities to standardize our financial systems if any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of our enterprise resource planning system were to occur they could adversely affect our operations including among other ways through a failure to meet demand for our products or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations 

collaborations and other relationships with third parties 

we depend on thirdparty collaborators service providers and others in the research development and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into joint ventures and other business development transactions in connection with our business to achieve expected longer term benefits we may make substantial upfront payments in such transactions which may negatively impact our reported earnings we rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development manufacturing and commercialization activities but we do not control many aspects of those activities third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual or other obligations to pfizer failure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any disruption in the relationships between pfizer and one or more of these third parties could delay or prevent the development approval or commercialization of our products and product candidates and could also result in noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business 

biopharmaceutical wholesalers 

in 2017  our largest biopharmaceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately 16  of our total revenues and approximately 33  of our total us revenues and our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 38  of our total revenues and approximately 79  of our total us revenues if one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties such wholesaler might decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we might be unable to collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers including us 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through collaborations alliances license and funding agreements joint ventures equity or debtbased investments mergers and acquisitions however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated timeframe or at all and integrate acquisitions further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess legal proceedings or regulatory issues often arise as a result of activities that occurred at acquired companies their partners and other third parties in 2016 for example we paid 7846 million to resolve allegations related to wyeth’s reporting of prices to the government with respect to protonix for activities that occurred prior to our 



acquisition of wyeth additionally we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions including the possibility that expected synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time frame 

counterfeit products 

a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicines can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual patients the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of underregulated wholesalers and repackagers the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facilities as counterfeit medicines are increasingly delivered direct to customers in small parcel packages and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters compared to the large profits that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit medicines further laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

pfizer’s global reputation makes its medicines prime targets for counterfeiting organizations counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact our business by among other things causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation 

we undertake significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines including among other things working with the fda and other regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicines implementing business practices designed to protect patient health promoting public policies intended to hinder counterfeiting working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines and working collaboratively with wholesalers pharmacies customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and repackagers no assurance can be given however that our efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase 

risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings  

pricing and reimbursement 

us and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls and limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies 

in the us many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform some states have implemented and other states are considering pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payments for pharmaceutical products including legislation on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented private thirdparty payers such as health plans increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing which could result in lower prices lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets healthcare provider purchasers directly or through group purchasing organizations are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in certain international markets such as europe japan china canada and south korea governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices access criteria eg through public or private health technology assessments or other means of cost control particularly under recent global financing pressures as a result we expect that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue 

the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccines business we participate in a tender process in many 



countries for participation in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business 

us healthcare reformhealthcare legislation 

the us healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes for example the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and established a major expansion of healthcare coverage financed in part by a number of new rebates discounts and taxes that had a significant effect on our expenses and profitability see the discussion under the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — regulatory environmentpricing and access — us healthcare legislation  section in our 2017  financial report and in item 1 business  under the caption government regulation and price constraints—in the united states  we face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca the likelihood of such a repeal currently appears low given the recent failure of the senate’s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of such aca provisions in october 2017 the president signed an executive order directing federal agencies to look for ways to authorize more health plans that could be less expensive because the plans would not have to meet all of the aca’s coverage requirements and announced that his administration will withhold the costsharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchange plans serving lowincome enrollees these and similar actions by the administration are widely expected to lead to fewer americans having comprehensive acacompliant health insurance even in the absence of a legislative repeal the revenues generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchanges under the aca are minor so the impact of the recent administration actions is expected to be limited there is no assurance that any future replacement modification or repeal of the aca will not adversely affect our business and financial results particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employersponsored insurance coverage and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business 

other us federal or state legislative or regulatory action andor policy efforts could adversely affect our business including among others changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries which is among the us presidential administration’s policy proposals restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 

us entitlement reform 

in the us government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products the congressional budget office routinely releases options for reducing federal spending and the december 2016 release includes proposals to cap medicaid grants to the states and to require manufacturers to pay a minimum rebate on drugs covered under part d of medicare for lowincome beneficiaries significant medicare reductions could also result if congress proceeds with certain proposals to convert the medicare feeforservice program into a premium support program or congress chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by the medicare payment advisory commission which are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of the medicare program these and any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

substantial regulation 

we are subject to extensive complex costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the us principally by the fda and the dea and foreign regulatory authorities failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution monetary penalties and other disciplinary actions including sanctions warning letters product seizures recalls fines injunctions suspension revocation of approvals or exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process including as the result of unfavorable preclinical and clinical trial results including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data there can be no assurance regarding our ability to meet anticipated preclinical and clinical trial commencement and completion dates regulatory submission and approval dates and launch dates for product candidates or as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products which will depend on the assessment by regulatory authorities of the benefitrisk profile suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products there is no assurance that we will be able to address 



the comments received by us from regulatory authorities such as the fda and the ema with respect to certain of our drug applications to the satisfaction of those authorities that any of our pipeline products will receive regulatory approval and if approved be commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets andor be commercially successful there is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings should they occur in addition there are risks associated with preliminary early stage or interim data including the risk that final results of studies for which preliminary early stage or interim data have been provided andor additional clinical trials may be different from including less favorable than the preliminary early stage or interim data results and may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication in addition clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety andor effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an inline product regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether 

there are many considerations that can affect the marketing of our products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete or adequately design and implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that can adversely affect our business further claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of inline products and product candidates can result in a negative impact on product sales product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the riskbenefit profile of products as they relate to alreadyapproved products has resulted in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for among other things additional clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies 

in addition failure to put in place adequate controls andor resources for effective collection reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance in compliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety regulatory actions and risks to product sales 

the fda along with other regulatory agencies around the world has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications which may result in delayed approvals of new generic products while the fda is taking steps to address the backlog of pending applications continued approval delays may be experienced by generic drug applicants over the next few years 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase 4 trials could result in the loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product regulatory agencies in countries outside the us often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate or are perceived to implicate an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on the availability or commercial potential of the affected products accordingly new data about our products or products similar to our products could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in updated labeling restrictions on use product withdrawal or recall 

interactions with healthcare professionals and government officials 

risks and uncertainties apply if we provide something of value to a healthcare professional other healthcare provider andor government official if the interaction is found to be improper government enforcement actions and penalties could result these risks may increase as nonus jurisdictions adopt or increase enforcement efforts of new antibribery laws and regulations requirements or industry standards in the us and certain jurisdictions abroad that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in laws and regulations including among others changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including tax rate changes new tax laws changes to existing tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory clarifications andor interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals including further clarifications andor interpretations of the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act competition laws privacy laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries for additional information see the  provisionbenefit for taxes on income — changes in tax laws and new accounting standards sections and notes to consolidated financial 



statements— note 1b basis of presentation and significant accounting policies adoption of new accounting standards in 2017  in our 2017  financial report 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings including patent product liability and other productrelated litigation including personal injury consumer offlabel promotion securities antitrust and breach of contract claims commercial environmental government investigations employment tax litigation and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all of our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations 

like other pharmaceutical companies we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the us other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate as a result we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations 

our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this 2017  form 10k as well as antikickback and false claims laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions like many companies in our industry we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as by consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries for example these claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

environmental claims and proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims and proceedings amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accruals for contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks related to intellectual property  

patent protection 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our branded products using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinct patent laws we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including among others claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term 



our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as a result of local political pressure or in the case of national emergencies in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products processes or dosage forms are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of or attempts to enforce patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition andor violations of antitrust laws such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents we are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers payers governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry we also are often involved in other proceedings such as inter partes review postgrant review reexamination or opposition proceedings before the us patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others also if one of our patents is found to be invalid by such proceedings generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products for example several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and postgrant review proceedings in the us the invalidation of these patents could potentially allow a competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

third party intellectual property claims 

a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted such challenges may include negotiation and litigation which may not be successful 

part of our eh business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities which may involve litigation associated costs and time delays and may ultimately not be successful these opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired where patents have been declared invalid or where products do not infringe the patents of others to achieve a “firsttomarket” or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars we may take action such as litigation asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable 

third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and timeconsuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launches and may result in significant damages we are involved in patentrelated disputes with third parties over our attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic pharmaceuticals products or biosimilars we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings including any appeals have not been resolved ie “atrisk” launch if one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party such third party may be awarded significant damages or we may be prevented from further sales of that product such damages may be enhanced as much as threefold in the event that we or one of our subsidiaries like hospira is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 



risk related to technology  

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our businesses in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including but not limited to personal information and intellectual property and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems and those of our thirdparty vendors with whom we contract and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal groups “hacktivists” nation states and others as a global pharmaceutical company our systems are subject to frequent attacks due to the nature of some of these attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

risks related to our strategic transactions  

strategic acquisitions 

the success of our acquisitions of hospira anacor medivation and astrazeneca’s small molecule antiinfectives business will depend in large part on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from combining these businesses with pfizer we for example may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with the acquisition of hospira or such cost savings within the expected time frame similarly the accretive impact anticipated from the acquisitions of hospira anacor and medivation may not be realized or may be delayed integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business including thirdparty relationships or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies we also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control unsuccessful clinical trials regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates including those acquired in these acquisitions hospira for example has experienced manufacturing disruptions and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues including receiving a warning letter from the fda in february 2017 communicating the fda ’ s view that certain violations of cgmp regulations exist at hospira ’ s manufacturing facility in mcpherson kansas manufacturing problems as well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our business — product manufacturing section in our 2017  financial report also the success of our acquisition of medivation depends on our ability to grow revenues for xtandi  and expand xtandi  into the nonmetastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer setting 

strategic alternatives for pfizer consumer healthcare 

in october 2017 we announced plans to review a range of strategic alternatives for our consumer healthcare business including a full or partial separation of the consumer healthcare business from pfizer through a spinoff sale or other transaction as well as the possibility that we may ultimately determine to retain the business we expect that a decision regarding strategic alternatives for the consumer healthcare business would be made in 2018 

we will incur expenses in connection with the review of strategic alternatives and are likely to incur significant expenses if we determine to move forward with any strategic alternatives our future results may be affected by the impact of our review and if applicable consummation of strategic alternatives for our consumer healthcare business which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including among other things the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic alternatives we may pursue the potential for disruption to our business and diversion of management’s attention from other aspects of our business the possibility that such strategic alternatives will not be completed on terms that are advantageous to pfizer and the possibility that we may be unable to realize a higher value for our consumer healthcare through strategic alternatives 



other risks 

the global economic environment 

like all businesses we are exposed to both global and industryspecific economic conditions governments corporations and insurance companies which provide insurance benefits to patients have implemented increases in costsharing and restrictions on access to medicines potentially causing patients to switch to generic or biosimilar products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments government financing pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices access criteria eg through public or private health technology assessments or other means of cost control examples include europe japan china canada south korea and a number of other international markets the us continues to maintain competitive insurance markets but has also seen significant increases in patient costsharing and growing government influence as government programs continue to grow as a source of coverage 

the global economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources due to our significant operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions but there can be no guarantee that changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources or impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

we continue to monitor credit capital restrictions and economic situations in volatile regions and markets especially where the ability to obtain us dollars for local currency is unpredictable and challenging we cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in these economic conditions or what impact they may have on our results of operations financial condition or business 

in addition given that a significant portion of our business is conducted in the eu including the uk the formal change in the relationship between the uk and the eu caused by brexit may pose certain implications to our research commercial and general business operations in the uk and the eu including the approval and supply of our products details on how brexit will be executed and the impact on the remaining eu countries will dictate how and whether the broader eu will be impacted and what the resulting impact on our business may be for additional information see the analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources — global economic conditions — uk section in our 2017  financial report 

we also continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts if trade restrictions reduce global economic activity or if other factors lead to a general economic downturn potential impacts could include declining sales increased costs volatility in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments required increases of our pension funding obligations increased government cost control efforts delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

foreign exchange and interest rate risk 

significant portions of our revenues costs and expenses as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 50  of our total 2017  revenues were derived from international operations including 21  from europe and 20  from japan and the rest of asia as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the uk pound the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses if the us dollar were to weaken against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would increase having a positive impact on earnings and our overall expenses would increase having a negative impact on earnings conversely if the us dollar were to strengthen against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would decrease having a negative impact on earnings and our overall expenses would decrease having a positive impact on earnings therefore significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results and financial guidance for additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook––our financial guidance for 2018  and analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources sections in our 2017  financial report 

in addition our interestbearing investments and borrowings and our pension benefit obligations net and our postretirement benefit obligations net are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section in our 2017  financial report for additional details see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7f financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and — note 11 pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans in our 2017  financial report and the 



significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions––benefit plans  section in our 2017  financial report those sections of our 2017  financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

cost and expense controlunusual eventsfailure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitions 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings internal reorganizations product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of i our costreduction and productivity initiatives ii our internal separation of our commercial operations into our current operating structure iii any other corporate strategic initiatives such as our evaluation of strategic alternatives for our consumer healthcare business and iv any acquisitions divestitures or other initiatives such as our acquisitions of hospira anacor medivation and astrazeneca’s small molecule antiinfectives business 

intangible assets goodwill and equitymethod investments 

our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future for goodwill all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity any such charge may be significant our other intangible assets including developed technology rights and brands face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assets may be significant as well for additional details see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions  section in our 2017  financial report 

we also regularly review our equitymethod investments for impairment an impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments we may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment events related to particular customers or asset types challenging market conditions or decisions by management 

internal control over financial reporting 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures could undermine the ability to provide accurate disclosure including with respect to financial information on a timely basis which could cause investors to lose confidence in our disclosures including with respect to financial information require significant resources to remediate the lapse or deficiency and expose us to legal or regulatory proceedings 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas

commercial operations 

we manage our commercial operations through two distinct business segments pfizer innovative health ih and pfizer essential health eh which was previously known as established products beginning in the second quarter of 2016 we reorganized our operating segments to reflect that we now manage our innovative pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare operations as one business segment ih   from the beginning of our fiscal year 2014 until the second quarter of 2016 these operations were managed as two business segments the global innovative products segment and the vaccines oncology and consumer healthcare segment we have revised priorperiod information to reflect the reorganization  the ih and eh operating segments are each led by a single manager each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain iprd projects for new investigational products and additional indications for inline products that generally have achieved proof of concept each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets 

some additional information about our business segments follows 



we expect that the ih biopharmaceutical portfolio of innovative largely patentprotected inline and newly launched products will be sustained by ongoing investments to develop promising assets and targeted business development in areas of focus to ensure a pipeline of highlydifferentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need the assets managed by ih are sciencedriven highly differentiated and generally require a high level of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers 

eh is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective lowercost highvalue treatments eh leverages our biologic development regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio additionally eh leverages capabilities in formulation development and manufacturing expertise to help advance its generic sterile injectables portfolio eh may also engage in targeted business development to further enable its commercial strategies

research and development 

innovation by our rd organization is very important to our success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs 

our rd operations 

we conduct rd internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms our rd spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations our wrd organization is generally responsible for research projects for our ih business until proofofconcept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the ih segment via the gpd organization which was formed in early 2016 for possible clinical and commercial development 

the gpd organization is a new unified center for latestage development for our innovative products gpd is expected to enable more efficient and effective development and enhance our ability to accelerate and progress assets through our pipeline gpd combines certain previously separate developmentrelated functions from the ih business and the wrd organization to achieve a development capability that is expected to deliver highquality efficient and wellexecuted clinical programs by enabling greater speed greater cost efficiencies and reduced complexity across our development portfolio 

the wrd and gpd organizations also have responsibility for certain sciencebased and other endtoend platformservices organizations which provide technical expertise and other services to the various rd projects including eh rd projects these organizations include sciencebased functions which are part of our wrd organization such as pharmaceutical sciences medicinal chemistry regulatory and drug safety as a result within each of these functions we are able to migrate resources among projects candidates andor targets in any therapeutic area and in most phases of development allowing us to react quickly in response to evolving needs 

we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time for additional information regarding our rd operations see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our strategy — research and development operations and  costs and expenses — research and development rd expenses — description of research and  development operations  sections in our 2016 financial report 

our rd priorities and strategy 

our rd priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies and vaccines with the greatest medical and commercial promise innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for longterm leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity to that end our research primarily focuses on 

 

we also seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines by entering into collaborations and alliance and license agreements with other companies as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity or debtbased investments these agreements enable us to codevelop license or acquire promising compounds technologies or capabilities we also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of the development costs of one or more of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments revenue sharing payments profit sharing payments andor royalties collaboration alliance license and funding agreements and equity or debtbased investments allow us to share risk and cost and to access external scientific and technological expertise and enable us to advance our own products as well as inlicensed or acquired products 

our rd pipeline and competition 

innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable according to the pharmaceutical benchmarking forum out of 20 compounds entering preclinical development only one is approved by a regulatory authority in a major market us the eu or japan the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development 

as of january 31 2017 we had the following number of projects in various stages of rd 

development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs while these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products in addition to discovering and developing new products our rd efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income—product developments — biopharmaceutical  section in our 2016  financial report which is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to rd we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence in addition several of our competitors operate without large rd expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration for additional information see the competition  and item 1a risk factors — competitive products  sections below 



international operations 

we have significant operations outside the us operations in developed and emerging markets are managed through our two business segments ih and eh emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastestgrowing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets 

we sell our products in over 125 countries revenues from operations outside the us of 265 billion  accounted for 50  of our total revenues in 2016  japan is our largest national market outside the us for a geographic breakdown of revenues see the table captioned geographic information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  in our 2016  financial report and the table captioned revenues by segment and geographic area  in our 2016  financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

revenues by national market 

our international operations are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors — risks affecting international operations  below our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws and regulations on pricing reimbursement and access to our products see government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states  below for a discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments depending upon market conditions for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7e financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2016  financial report as well as the  forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section in our 2016  financial report those sections of our 2016  financial report are incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical businesses we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants and pharmacists mcos that provide insurance coverage such as hospitals integrated delivery systems pbms and health plans and employers and government agencies who hire mcos to provide health benefits to their employees we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 



our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies and in the case of our vaccines products in the us we primarily sell directly to the centers for disease control and prevention wholesalers and individual provider offices we seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and mco formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos mcos use various benefit designs such as tiered copays for formulary products to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions we also work with mcos to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

in 2016 our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 39  of our total revenues and approximately 76  of our total us revenues 

 of 2016 total revenues and us revenues from 

major biopharmaceutical wholesalers and other customers 

our global consumer healthcare business uses its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products and occasionally uses distributors and agents principally in smaller markets the advertising and promotions for our consumer healthcare business are generally disseminated to consumers through television print digital and other media advertising as well as through instore promotion consumer healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies retail chains and grocery and convenience stores our consumer healthcare business generates a significant portion of its sales from several large customers the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the consumer healthcare business 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance to pfizer trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country further patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period andor the granted patent term extension are those for the medicines set forth in the table below patent term extensions supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below unless they have been granted by the issuing authority in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions to methods of manufacturing or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect our drug from generic or as applicable biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent 



 

a number of our current products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years for additional information including a description of certain of our copromotion agreements and their expiration dates and a further discussion of our products experiencing or expected to experience in 2017 patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the us europe or japan see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights section in our 2016 financial report and item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products below 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents these include candidates that would compete with among other products xeljanz  and xtandi    for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a1 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—patent litigation  in our 2016  financial report 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms or conversion of the active ingredient to otc products 

biotechnology products 

our biotechnology products including benefix  refacto  xyntha  and enbrel  we market enbrel  outside the us and canada may face in the future or already face competition from biosimilars also referred to as followon biologics in the us such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a followon recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin  which was approved under the ffdca 

biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and to have no clinically meaningful differences biosimilars have the potential to offer highquality lowercost alternatives to biologic medicines abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage in 2010 of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us the regulatory implementation of these aca provisions is ongoing and since 2015 the fda approved a number of biosimilars including inflectra  infliximabdyyb pfizer has exclusive commercialization rights to inflectra  from celltrion inc and celltrion healthcare co ltd collectively celltrion in the us canada and certain other territories pfizer also shares inflectra  commercialization rights with celltrion in europe for additional information on inflectra  see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income –– revenues –– selected product descriptions –– inflectraremsima  section in our 2016 financial report for additional information on the aca’s approval framework for biosimilars see government regulation and price constraints — biosimilar regulation  below 

in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in 2013 the ema approved the first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody and in january 2016 the european commission approved an etanercept biosimilar referencing pfizer’s enbrel  in japan the regulatory authority has granted marketing authorizations for certain biosimilars pursuant to a guideline for biosimilar approvals issued in 2009 

if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars that reference our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired however biosimilar manufacturing is complex at least initially upon approval of a biosimilar competitor biosimilar competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as generic competition with respect to small molecule drugs 

as part of our business strategy we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths to develop biosimilar medicines as such a betterdefined biosimilars approval pathway will assist us in pursuing approval of our own biosimilar products in the us see item 1a risk factors — biotechnology products  below 

we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products likewise as we develop and manufacture biosimilars and seek to launch products patents may be asserted against us 

international 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased biopharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products 

this competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in rd as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 



operating conditions have become more challenging under mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs we believe that we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

our consumer healthcare business faces competition from otc business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies and retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources customer acceptance product quality our and our competitors’ introduction of new products ingredients claims dosage forms or other forms of innovation and pricing regulatory and legislative matters such as product labeling patient access and prescription to otc switches 

our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines for example prevnar 13 may face competition in the form of alternative 13valent or additional valent nextgeneration pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents which may adversely affect our future results 

our generics and biosimilars businesses compete with branded products from competitors as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers globally pfizer sells generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain competitors’ solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products as well as biosimilars we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “firsttomarket” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars as a “firsttomarket” position provides customers a lowercost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with a period of exclusivity as the only generic or biosimilar provider 

managed care organizations 

the evolution of managed care in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 283 million people in the us now have some form of health insurance coverage due to the expansion of health insurance coverage see government regulation and price constraints — in the united states  below the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the us continues to grow in importance 

the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate as well as their importance to pfizer 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures mcos typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine volume purchasing longterm contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs in addition by placing branded medicines on highertier status in their formularies leading to higher patient copays or nonpreferred tier status mcos transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient resulting in significant outofpocket expenses for the patient especially for chronic treatments this financial disincentive is a tool for mcos to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the mcos mcos have recently introduced additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing and valuebased pricingcontracting to improve their cost containment efforts we are closely monitoring these new approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them 

due to their generally lower cost generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of mco formularies the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems in 2015 the fda approved the first biosimilar and mcos are evaluating the appropriate placement of these new agents on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies however increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a nonpreferred status 

mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are 



carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

the aca has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes in 2017 there likely will be federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca we are monitoring any such actions to see if any changes to the aca will be enacted that would impact our business 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time several competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration generic competitors often operate without large rd expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic competitors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute for brandname drugs generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs in a small subset of states prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2016  and none are expected in 2017  we have successfully secured the materials necessary to meet our requirements where there have been shortterm imbalances between supply and demand but generally at higher prices than those historically paid 

government regulation and price constraints 

pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business certain laws and regulations that govern pfizer’s business are discussed below 

general   our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our products could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmental bodies for additional information on these proceedings and actions see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings  in our 2016 financial report criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties warning letters and product recalls or seizures as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions could result from such proceedings and actions 

in the united states 

drug regulation   in the us biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre and postmarket regulations by the fda including regulations that govern the testing manufacturing safety efficacy labeling and storage of our products record keeping advertising and promotion our products are also subject to postmarket surveillance under the ffdca and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs as well as the public health service act and its implementing regulations with respect to biologics the fda also regulates our consumer healthcare products 

other us federal agencies including the dea also regulate certain of our products the us federal trade commission has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products including otc drugs and dietary supplements many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec 

before a new biopharmaceutical product may be marketed in the us the fda must approve an nda for a new drug or a bla for a biologic the steps required before the fda will approve an nda or bla generally include preclinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the study sponsor sponsor submission of the application to the fda for review the fda’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness and the fda’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured 

before a generic drug may be marketed in the us the fda must approve an anda the anda review process typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the referenced drug previously approved through the nda process the anda process however does require the sponsor to conduct one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the anda drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved referenced brand drug submission of an application to the fda for review and the fda’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured 

as a condition of product approval the fda may require a sponsor to conduct postmarketing clinical studies known as phase 4 studies and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of the approved product the fda may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarket studies and programs any modifications to a drug or biologic including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities may require the submission and approval of a new or supplemental nda or bla before the modification can be implemented which may require that we develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs and biologics is subject to continuing regulation by the fda including recordkeeping requirements reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product and adherence to cgmps which regulate all aspects of the manufacturing process we are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics including but not limited to standards and regulations for directtoconsumer advertising failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions including warning letters product recalls or seizures injunctions fines civil penalties andor criminal prosecution 

biosimilar regulation  the aca created a framework for the approval of biosimilars also known as followon biologics following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic 

the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation and since 2015 approved a number of biosimilars including inflectra  through those approvals and the issuance of draft and final guidance the fda has begun to address open questions about the naming convention for biosimilars and the use of data from a nonuslicensed comparator to demonstrate biosimilarity andor interchangeability with a uslicensed reference product over the next several years the fda is expected to issue additional draft and final guidance documents impacting biosimilars in 2017 there likely will be federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca if the aca is repealed substantially modified or invalidated it is unclear what if any impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation 

sales and marketing   the marketing practices of us biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs these laws include antikickback laws and false claims laws antikickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business including the purchase or prescription of a particular product false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented any claims for payment for goods including drugs or services to thirdparty payers including medicare and medicaid that are false or fraudulent although the specific provisions of these laws vary their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to any particular industry practices including the marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions andor exclusion from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid the federal government and various states have also enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies the laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of such interactions andor require the adoption of compliance standards or programs many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations 

pricing and reimbursement   pricing for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program the 340b drug pricing program and the medicare part d program pfizer must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program and medicare part b the calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose pfizer to penalties see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview section in our 2016 financial report and in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1g basis of presentation and significant accounting policies revenues and trade accounts receivable in our 2016 financial report which are incorporated by reference 

government and private thirdparty payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products for example the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under medicaid restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states as another example access to our products under the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans with which state medicaid agencies contract to provide services to medicaid beneficiaries given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises a growing number of states are considering a variety of costcontrol strategies including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers who are the primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products in the us will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers including us 

healthcare reform  the us and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry in march 2010 the us congress enacted the aca which included changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical industries such as 

 

the aca included provisions designed to increase the number of americans covered by health insurance specifically since 2014 the aca has required most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or potentially to pay a penalty for noncompliance and has offered states the option of expanding medicaid coverage to additional individuals the implementation of the coverage expansion had a negligible impact on pfizer’s 2016 revenues 

the aca also establishes an independent payment advisory board ipab to reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending by proposing changes to medicare payments if expenditures exceed certain targets the threshold for triggering ipab proposals was not reached in 2016 so no adjustments will be made under the ipab until 2019 at the earliest if no ipab members are nominated the duties of the ipab will default to the secretary of the department of health and human services 

additionally efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products could adversely affect our business if implemented there has recently been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals we believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we continue to work with stakeholders to ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system 

adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand for or pricing of our products in 2017 we may face uncertainties because there likely will be federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca there is no assurance that the aca as currently enacted or as amended in the future will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business we will continue to actively work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes and lower costs to the healthcare system 

anticorruption   the fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries 

new drug approvals and pharmacovigilance  in the eu the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the mutual recognition procedure the decentralized procedure or the eu centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the european economic area countries norway iceland and liechtenstein the centralized procedure managed by the ema results in one single authorization for the whole eu which provides the most rapid and efficient means of gaining approval across the eu and is the one most commonly used for new products 

in japan the pmda is the point of entry for businesses looking to sell drugs in the country the pmda which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities including clinical studies approvals postmarketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety must approve an application before a new drug product may be marketed in japan the pmda also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals 

health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority ie similar to the authority of the fda or the ema before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval these requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the us and europe 

china’s regulatory system is unique in many ways and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with us or other international standards it is common to see treatments entering the chinese market two to eight years behind first marketing in the us and europe because historically china has only issued import drug licenses to treatments approved by a foreign regulatory authority in addition to obtain marketing approvals for new drugs in china a clinical trial authorization issued by the cfda is required for the conduct of phase i to iii clinical trials foreign applicants of imported drugs if including chinaoriginated data in their multiregional clinical trials and meeting the relevant technical review requirements may receive casebycase additional local clinical trial waivers oral generics on the other hand only need to undergo bioequivalence studies upon a filing for record with the cfda while sterile injectable generics may need local confirmatory trials for regulatory approval a chinese drug license will only be granted if following review the cfda determines that the clinical data confirm the drug’s safety and effectiveness 

in the eu there is detailed legislation and guidance on pharmacovigilance which has been increased and strengthened in recent years the ema’s pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the eu authorities eu regulators may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization safety and efficacy studies at the time of approval or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products outside developed markets such as the eu and japan pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive but there is a trend toward increasing regulation 

pricing and reimbursement  in europe japan china canada south korea and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global economic pressures governments including the different eu member states may use a variety of costcontainment measures for our pharmaceutical products including price cuts mandatory rebates valuebased pricing and international reference pricing ie the practice of many countries linking their regulated medicine prices to those of other countries this international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in different countries and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

in particular international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation price variations exacerbated by international reference pricing systems also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries 

in addition several important multilateral organizations such as the united nations un and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are increasing policy pressures and scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations eg 2016 un high level panel report on access to medicines  and 2017 oecd report on new health technologies — managing access value and sustainability  government adoption of these recommendations may lead to additional pricing pressures 

in japan the government recently released a basic framework for pharmaceutical pricing that may lead to the adoption of cost effectiveness assessments and pricing reviews in china governmentset price caps were lifted for the vast majority of drug products on june 1 2015 however the government continues to exercise indirect price control by setting reimbursement standards through a negotiation mechanism between drug manufacturers and social insurance administrations in addition the cfda is now asking some companies to enter into pricing commitments as a condition for regulatory approval 

eu regulatory changes   the eu adopted a new clinical trials regulation in may 2014 which is expected to come into effect by october 2018 this new regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the eu and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results 

in another effort to increase the public availability of clinical trial results the ema adopted a new policy on publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use which became effective january 1 2015 and is now being actively implemented under this policy the ema now proactively publishes clinical trial data from application dossiers for new marketing authorizations including data from trials taking place outside the eu after the ema has made a decision on the marketing authorization the policy includes limited exceptions for commercially confidential information and the exclusion of any protected personal data 

brexit  in june 2016 the uk electorate voted in a referendum to leave the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” at present it is unclear whether the uk will remain within or affiliated to the eu system of medicines approval and regulation or separate itself completely immediately following brexit eu laws are expected to continue to apply until amended or repealed by the uk parliament it is however probable that the ema currently in london will have to relocate to an eu member state many of which have already bid to become the new host country for additional information on brexit see the analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources — global economic conditions — uk in our 2016 financial report  

china regulatory changes   in an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce the existing drug approval backlogs the cfda unveiled several reform initiatives for china’s drug approval system the regulator now divides drugs into new drugs and generics with the definition for new drugs changed from “drugs never marketed in china” to “drugs that are neither marketed in or outside china” this change in definition creates more incentives for china’s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms because imported drugs first marketed outside china are no longer considered new drugs furthermore the revised rules do not clarify whether foreign regulatory approval is still required for imported drug final approval in china another major initiative is the piloting of the “marketing authorization holder” system in ten provinces in china where the market authorizationdrug license holders are no longer required to be the actual manufacturers the “marketing authorization holder” system will allow for more flexibilities in contract manufacturing arrangements and asset transfers but it is not applicable to imported drugs 

a number of other policy changes are expected to be able to streamline and accelerate domestic and imported drug approvals in china these changes include introducing an umbrella clinical trial authorization for all three phases of registration studies instead of the original phasebyphase approvals implementing a filingrecordation system for bioequivalence studies on generics instead of the original review and approval system and admitting more types of drugs as innovative drugs eligible for the fast trackgreen channel approval pathway 

healthcare provider transparency and disclosures   a number of countries have implemented laws requiring or their industry associations have recommended disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers for example in 2013 the efpia released its disclosure code of transfers of value to healthcare professionals and organizations the code requires all members of efpia including pfizer to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations beginning in 2016 covering the relevant transfers in 2015 

intellectual property   the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2033 for leastdeveloped countries while we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world a number of countries have made improvements we include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries 

while the global intellectual property environment has improved following wtotrips and bilateralmultilateral trade agreements our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in emerging market countries in particular governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries there is considerable political and economic pressure to weaken existing intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions eg new medical treatment methods revocation of patents issuance and threat of issuance of compulsory licenses weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries 

canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity eight years plus sixmonth pediatric extension but it lacks the predictability and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide through intense negotiations as part of the canadaeu comprehensive economic  trade agreement canadian authorities reluctantly agreed to introduce a right of appeal a form of patent term restoration and to elevate the current data protection to a treaty obligation further aligning its intellectual property regime to the eu 

in china the intellectual property environment has improved although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with world trade organization provisions and several companies including pfizer have established rd centers in china due to increased confidence in china’s intellectual property environment despite this china remained on the us trade representative’s priority watch list for 2016 further the standards for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in other major markets including the us europe and japan also while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent for example the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage 

in brazil and other latin american countries the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents eg national health surveillance agency in brazil restrictive patentability rules ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions such as new medical uses of drug products may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products 

in india policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents the increasing tendency of the indian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings both pre and postgrant and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to safeguard many of our inventions and our investments in innovation these policies heighten the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population challenges against pfizer patents in india are ongoing 

in south korea the laws and regulations for the patentregulatory approval linkage system was implemented as part of the uskorea free trade agreement in 2012 the korean patentregulatory approval linkage system includes biologics 

environmental matters 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a3 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—commercial and other matters  in our 2016  financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2016  for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

climate change presents risks to our operations including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers we cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future however we have a program for reviewing our vulnerability to these potential risks and we update our assessments periodically to date we have concluded that because of our facility locations our existing distribution networks and our controls we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on pfizer in the near term

risks related to our business industry and operations  

managed care trends 

consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private insurers private thirdparty insurers as well as governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue in addition to formulary tier copay differentials private health insurance companies and selfinsured employers have been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products this cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medication choices as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals mcos have recently introduced additional measures such as newtomarket blocks exclusion lists indicationbased pricing and valuebased pricingcontracting to improve their cost containment efforts private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us payer market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form biopharmaceutical companies may face greater 



pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues the date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time which can adversely affect our business a number of our products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years 

also generic manufacturers have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents these include candidates that would compete with among other products xeljanz  and xtandi  our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering several of their products that may impact our licenses or copromotion rights to such products in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products including new product entrants inline branded products generic products private label products biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our inline drugs and drug candidates the introduction of competitive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

we also produce generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with branded products from competitors as well as other generic and biosimilar manufacturers the ability to launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before anticipated generic or biosimilar market formation is important to that product’s profitability prices for products typically decline sometimes dramatically following generic market formation and as additional companies receive approvals to market that product competition intensifies if a company’s generic or biosimilar product can be “firsttomarket” such that its only competition is the branded drug for a period of time higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market with increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product market the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products will increase in importance our success will depend on our ability to bring new products to market quickly 

dependence on key inline products 

we recorded direct product revenues of more than 1 billion for each of eight biopharmaceutical products prevnar 13prevenar 13  lyrica  enbrel  ibrance  lipitor  viagra  sutent and the premarin  family of products as well as more than 1 billion in alliance revenues primarily eliquis  in 2016 those products and alliance revenues accounted for 43 of our total revenues in 2016 if these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection if applicable changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years including some of our billiondollar and previously billiondollar products and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are or have been the subject of pending legal challenges for example pursuant to terms of a settlement agreement certain formulations of zyvox  became subject to generic competition in the us in january 2015 in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights — recent losses and expected losses of product exclusivity section in our 2016 financial report 

further our alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and copromotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time for additional information on recent losses of collaborations rights see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights — recent losses of collaboration rights section in our 2016 financial report 



research and development investment 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity as well as to provide for earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers either through internal rd or through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties however balancing current growth investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge the average costs of product development continue to rise as do the regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas which may affect the number of candidates funded as well as the sustainability of the rd portfolio our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in rd for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth 

additionally our rd investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipeline could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the science may not work for any given program despite the significant investment required for rd and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement 

we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time there can be no assurance that these strategies will deliver the desired result which could affect profitability in the future 

biotechnology products 

abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow the expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products 

we are developing biosimilar medicines the evolving pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products by the fda and regulatory authorities in certain other countries could diminish the value of our investments in biosimilars other risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products there is also a risk of lower prescriptions of biosimilars due to potential concerns over comparability with innovator medicines 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities if it receives regulatory approval for example a wider range of studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process however each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit the increased complexity of development and the potential delays to approval of the lead indication we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time the degree to which such potential challenges are foreseen and addressed could affect our future results 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of developed markets leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s global performance as a result we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets including the full integration of emerging markets into each of our two distinct operating segments ih and eh however there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that these countries will continue to sustain these growth rates in addition some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending even though we constantly 



monitor the evolving emerging markets for any unanticipated risk to pfizer certain financial or political events in such markets as discussed above can adversely affect our results 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products has generated payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector while the impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has had limited impact on pfizer to date a number of factors may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future given our growing specialty business portfolio these include the increasing use of health technology assessments in markets around the world us pbms seeking to negotiate greater discounts deteriorating finances of certain governments the uptake of biosimilars as they become available and efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products 

consumer healthcare 

the consumer healthcare business may be impacted by economic volatility the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal reformulation andor relabeling of certain products eg coughcold products see the global economic environment  risk factor below 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions shutdowns approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions or shortages reputational harm product liability unanticipated costs or otherwise examples of such difficulties or delays include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network andor comply with cgmps and other applicable regulations such as serialization which allows for track and trace of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety risks to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or manmade disasters at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor including those that may be related to climate change or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration product diversion product theft and counterfeit goods 

regulatory agencies periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cgmp requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions such as warning letters suspension of manufacturing seizure of product injunctions or voluntary recall of a product any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in february 2017 we received a warning letter from the fda communicating fda’s view that certain violations of cgmp regulations exist at hospira’s manufacturing facility in mcpherson kansas hospira is undertaking corrective actions to address the concerns raised by the fda communication with the fda is ongoing until the violations are corrected the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates related to products manufactured at mcpherson kansas 

outsourcing and enterprise resource planning 

we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial execution clinical lab services nonclinical research safety services integrated facilities management and other areas for example in 2016 we placed the majority of our clinical trial execution services with four strategic clinical research organizations cros service performance issues with these cros may adversely impact the progression of our clinical trial programs outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables which may result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues erroneous data supply disruptions noncompliance including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards or reputational harm with potential negative implications for our results 

we continue to pursue a multiyear initiative to outsource some transactionprocessing activities within certain accounting processes and are migrating to a consistent enterprise resource planning system across the organization these are enhancements of ongoing activities to support the growth of our financial shared service capabilities and standardize our financial systems if any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of our enterprise resource planning system were to occur they could adversely affect our operations including among other ways through a failure to meet demand for our products or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations 



collaborations and other relationships with third parties 

we depend on thirdparty collaborators service providers and others in the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into joint ventures and other business development transactions in connection with our business to achieve expected longer term benefits we may make substantial upfront payments in such transactions which may negatively impact our reported earnings we rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development and commercialization activities but we do not control many aspects of those activities third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to pfizer or any disruption in the relationships between pfizer and these third parties could delay or prevent the development approval or commercialization of our products and product candidates and could also result in noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business 

difficulties of our biopharmaceutical wholesalers 

in 2016 our largest biopharmaceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately 16  of our total revenues and approximately 31 of our total us revenues and our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 39  of our total revenues and approximately 76  of our total us revenues if one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties such wholesaler might decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we might be unable to collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through collaborations alliances licenses joint ventures equity or debtbased investments mergers and acquisitions however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated timeframe or at all and integrate acquisitions further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess additionally we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions including the possibility that expected synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time frame 

counterfeit products 

a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicines can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual patients the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of underregulated wholesalers and repackagers the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facilities as counterfeit medicines are increasingly delivered direct to customers in small parcel packages and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters further laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

pfizer’s global reputation makes its medicines prime targets for counterfeiting organizations counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact our business by among other things causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation 

we undertake significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines including among other things working with the fda and other regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicines implementing business practices designed to protect patient health promoting public policies intended to hinder counterfeiting working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines and working collaboratively with wholesalers pharmacies customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and repackagers no 



assurance can be given however that our efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase 

risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings  

pricing and reimbursement 

us and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls and limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies 

in the us many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform some states have implemented and other states are considering pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible additionally efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products could adversely affect our business if implemented private thirdparty payers such as health plans increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing which could result in lower prices lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets healthcare provider purchasers directly or through group purchasing organizations are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in certain international markets such as europe japan china canada and south korea governments take an active role in setting prices access criteria eg through public or private health technology assessments or other means of cost control particularly under recent global financing pressures as a result we expect that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue 

the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions failure to obtain timely or adequate governmentapproved pricing or formulary placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccines business we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business 

us healthcare reformhealthcare legislation 

the us healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes for example the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and established a major expansion of health care coverage financed in part by a number of new rebates discounts and taxes that had a significant effect on our expenses and profitability see the discussion under the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — regulatory environmentpricing and access — us healthcare legislation  section in our 2016 financial report and in item 1 business  under the caption government regulation and price constraints—in the united states  in 2017 we may face uncertainties because there likely will be federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca although the revenues generated for pfizer by the medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges under the aca have been exceeded by the new rebates discounts and taxes there is no assurance that repeal or replacement of the aca will not adversely affect our business and financial results particularly if replacement legislation reduces incentives for employersponsored insurance coverage and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business 

other us federal or state legislative or regulatory action andor policy efforts could adversely affect our business including among others changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries which is among the us presidential administration’s policy proposals restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 

us deficitreduction actions 

in the us government actions to reduce the national deficit may affect payment by government programs for our products or services provided using our products the congressional budget office routinely releases options for reducing the federal deficit and the december 2016 release includes proposals to cap medicaid grants to the states and to require manufacturers to pay a minimum rebate on drugs covered under part d of medicare for lowincome beneficiaries significant medicare reductions could also result if congress proceeds with certain proposals to convert the medicare feeforservice program into a premium support program or it chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by the medicare payment advisory commission which are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of the medicare program these and any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health 



programs that may be implemented andor any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us as part of any broad deficitreduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

substantial regulation 

we are subject to extensive complex costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the us principally by the fda and the dea and foreign regulatory authorities failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution monetary penalties and other disciplinary actions including sanctions warning letters product seizures recalls fines injunctions suspension revocation of approvals or exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

innovation is critical to the success of our company the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process including as the result of unfavorable preclinical and clinical trial results including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data there can be no assurance regarding our ability to meet anticipated preclinical and clinical trial commencement and completion dates regulatory submission and approval dates and launch dates for product candidates or as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products which will depend on the assessment by regulatory authorities of the benefitrisk profile suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products there is no assurance that we will be able to address the comments in complete response letters received by us with respect to certain of our drug applications to the satisfaction of the fda that any of our late stage pipeline products will receive regulatory approval andor be commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets andor be commercially successful there is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings should they occur in addition there are risks associated with interim data including the risk that final results of studies for which interim data have been provided andor additional clinical trials may be different from including less favorable than the interim data results and may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication 

there are many considerations that can affect the marketing of our products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete or adequately design and implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that can adversely affect our business further claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in a negative impact on product sales product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the riskbenefit profile of products as they relate to alreadyapproved products has resulted in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for among other things additional clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies 

in addition failure to put in place adequate controls andor resources for effective collection reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance in compliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety regulatory actions and risks to product sales 

the fda along with other regulatory agencies around the world has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications which has delayed approvals of new generic products these delays have become longer and while the fda has stated that it is taking steps to address the backlog of pending applications continued approval delays may be experienced by generic drug applicants over the next few years 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase 4 trials could result in the loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product regulatory agencies in countries outside the us often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate or are perceived to implicate an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on the availability or commercial potential of the affected products accordingly new data about our products or products similar to our products could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or 



perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in updated labeling restrictions on use product withdrawal or recall 

interactions with healthcare professionals and government officials 

risks and uncertainties apply if we provide something of value to a healthcare professional andor government official if the interaction is found to be improper government enforcement actions and penalties could result these risks may increase as nonus jurisdictions adopt or increase enforcement efforts of new antibribery laws and regulations 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in laws and regulations including among others changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including tax rate changes new tax laws changes to existing tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals competition laws privacy laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries for additional information see the  provision for taxes on income — changes in tax law and new accounting standards sections and notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1b basis of presentation and significant accounting policies adoption of new accounting standards  in our 2016 financial report 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities antitrust environmental employment and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all of our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations 

like other pharmaceutical companies we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the us other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate as a result we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis criminal charges and substantial fines andor civil penalties as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions could result from government investigations 

our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this 2016 form 10k as well as antikickback and false claims laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions like many companies in our industry we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as by consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries for example these claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

environmental claims and proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims and proceedings amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accruals for contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations 



risks related to intellectual property  

patent protection 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our branded products using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinct patent laws we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including among others claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term 

our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as a result of local political pressure or in the case of national emergencies in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights most of the suits by generic drug manufacturers involve claims that patents covering our products processes or dosage forms are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer also counterclaims as well as various independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of or attempts to enforce patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition andor violations of antitrust laws we are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers payers governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

third party intellectual property claims 

a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted such challenges may include negotiation and litigation which may not be successful 

part of our eh business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities which may involve litigation associated costs and time delays and may ultimately not be successful these opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired where patents have been declared invalid or where products do not infringe the patents of others to achieve a “firsttomarket” or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars we may take action such as litigation asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable 

third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and timeconsuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launches and may result in significant damages we are involved in patentrelated disputes with third parties over our attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic 



pharmaceuticals products or biosimilars we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings including any appeals have not been resolved ie “atrisk” launch if those proceedings ultimately determine that our products infringe the patent rights of third parties we may face patent infringement damages including the possibility of owing the third party a reasonable royalty or the lost profits from the sale of the branded product remedies also may include or consist of an injunction preventing us from further manufacture or sales of the affected product during the term of one or more of the valid infringed patents any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

risk related to technology  

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our businesses in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including but not limited to personal information and intellectual property and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems and those of our thirdparty vendors with whom we contract and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal groups “hacktivists” nation states and others as a global pharmaceutical company our systems are subject to frequent attacks due to the nature of some of these attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

risks related to our strategic transactions  

strategic acquisitions 

the success of our acquisitions of hospira anacor medivation and astrazeneca’s small molecule antiinfectives business will depend in large part on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from combining these businesses with pfizer we for example may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with the acquisition of hospira or such cost savings within the expected time frame similarly the accretive impact anticipated from the acquisitions of hospira anacor and medivation may not be realized or may be delayed integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business including thirdparty relationships or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies we also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control unsuccessful clinical trials regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges regularly adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates including those acquired in these acquisitions hospira for example has experienced manufacturing disruptions device remediations and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues including receiving a warning letter from the fda in february 2017 communicating fda ’ s view that certain violations of cgmp regulations exist at hospira ’ s manufacturing facility in mcpherson kansas manufacturing problems as well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs 

other risks 

the global economic environment 

like all businesses we are exposed to both global and industryspecific economic conditions governments corporations and insurance companies which provide insurance benefits to patients have implemented increases in costsharing and restrictions on access to medicines potentially causing patients to switch to generic products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments government financing pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices access criteria eg through public or private health technology assessments or other means of cost control examples include europe japan china canada south korea and a number of other international markets the us continues to maintain competitive insurance markets but has also seen significant 



increases in patient costsharing and growing government influence as government programs continue to grow as a source of coverage 

the global economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate that it will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources due to our significant operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions but there can be no guarantee that changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources or impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

we continue to monitor credit capital restrictions and economic situations in volatile regions and markets especially where the ability to obtain us dollars for local currency is unpredictable and challenging we cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in these economic conditions or what impact they may have on our results of operations financial condition or business 

in addition given that a significant portion of our business is conducted in the eu including the uk the formal change in the relationship between the uk and the eu caused by brexit may pose certain implications to our research commercial and general business operations in the uk and the eu details on how brexit will be executed and the impact on the remaining eu countries will dictate how and whether the broader eu will be impacted and what the resulting impact on our business may be especially in eu nations with weaker economic conditions such as greece for additional information see the analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources — global economic conditions — uk section in our 2016 financial report 

we also continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts if trade restrictions reduce global economic activity or if other factors lead to a general economic downturn potential impacts could include declining sales increased costs volatility in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments required increases of our pension funding obligations increased government cost control efforts delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

foreign exchange and interest rate risk 

significant portions of our revenues and earnings as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 50  of our total 2016 revenues were derived from international operations including 21 from europe and 20 from japan and the rest of asia as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the uk pound the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses if the us dollar were to weaken against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would increase having a positive impact on earnings and our overall expenses would increase having a negative impact on earnings conversely if the us dollar were to strengthen against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would decrease having a negative impact on earnings and our overall expenses would decrease having a positive impact on earnings therefore significant changes in foreign exchange rates including those changes resulting from the volatility following the uk referendum in which voters approved brexit can impact our results and our financial guidance 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results and financial guidance for additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook––our financial guidance for 2017  and analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources sections in our 2016 financial report 

in addition our interestbearing investments and borrowings and our pension benefit obligations net and our postretirement benefit obligations net are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section in our 2016 financial report for additional details see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7e financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and — note 11 pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans in our 2016 financial report and the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions––benefit plans  section in our 2016 financial report those sections of our 2016 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 



cost and expense controlunusual eventsfailure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitionsintangible assets goodwill and equitymethod investments 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings internal reorganizations product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of i our costreduction and productivity initiatives ii our internal separation of our commercial operations into our current operating structure iii any other corporate strategic initiatives and iv any acquisitions divestitures or other initiatives such as our acquisitions of hospira anacor medivation and astrazeneca’s small molecule antiinfectives business 

in addition our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future for goodwill all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity any such charge may be significant our other intangible assets including developed technology rights and brands face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assets may be significant as well for additional details see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions  section in our 2016 financial report 

we also regularly review our equitymethod investments for impairment an impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments we may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment events related to particular customers or asset types challenging market conditions or decisions by management 

internal control over financial reporting 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures could undermine the ability to provide accurate disclosure including with respect to financial information on a timely basis which could cause investors to lose confidence in our disclosures including with respect to financial information require significant resources to remediate the lapse or deficiency and expose us to legal or regulatory proceedings 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas

research and development 

innovation by our rd organization is very important to our success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs 

we conduct rd internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms our wrd organization is generally responsible for research projects until proofofconcept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the appropriate business unit for possible clinical and commercial development the wrd organization also has responsibility for certain sciencebased and other platformservices organizations which provide technical expertise and other services to the various rd projects wrd is also responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies including all safetyevent activities 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    6 

our rd primarily focuses on six highpriority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules—immunology and inflammation cardiovascular and metabolic diseases oncology vaccines neuroscience and pain and rare diseases another area of focus is biosimilars with the acquisition of hospira we have expanded our biosimilars pipeline and added rd capabilities for sterile injectables and infusion systems 

we also seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines by entering into collaborations and alliance and license agreements with other companies as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity or debtbased investments these agreements enable us to codevelop license or acquire promising compounds technologies or capabilities collaboration alliance and license agreements and equity or debtbased investments allow us to share risk and cost to access external scientific and technological expertise and enable us to advance our own products as well as inlicensed or acquired products 

drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable according to the pharmaceutical benchmarking forum out of 20 compounds entering preclinical development only one is approved by a regulatory authority in a major market us the eu or japan the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

as of february 2 2016 we had the following number of projects in various stages of rd 

development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products in addition to discovering and developing new products our rd efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income—product developments — biopharmaceutical  section in our 2015  financial report which is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to rd we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence in addition several of our competitors operate without large rd expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration for additional information see the competition  and item 1a risk factors — competitive products  sections below 

we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time our rd priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for longterm leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period andor the granted patent term extension are those for the medicines set forth in the table below patent term extensions supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below unless they have been granted by the issuing authority in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions to methods of manufacturing or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect our drug from generic or as applicable biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent

a number of our current products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years for additional information including a description of certain of our copromotion agreements and their expiration dates and a further discussion of our products experiencing or expected to experience in 2016 patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the us europe or japan see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights section in our 2015 financial report and item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products below 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products sutent  epipen  toviaz   tygacil  extendedrelease capsules and precedex premix    for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a1 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—patent litigation  in our 2015  financial report 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to otc products

biotechnology products 

our biotechnology products including benefix  refacto  xyntha  and enbrel  we market enbrel  outside the us and canada may face competition in the future from biosimilars also referred to as followon biologics in the us such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a followon recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin  which was approved under the ffdca 

biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and to have no clinically meaningful differences biosimilars have the potential to offer highquality lowercost alternatives to biologic medicines abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage in 2010 of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us the regulatory implementation of these aca provisions is ongoing and the fda has issued draft guidance on subjects such as nonproprietary naming of biologic products and reference product exclusivity and final guidance on a number of subjects such as scientific considerations in demonstrating biosimilarity moreover in 2015 the fda approved the first biosimilar and currently has several other biosimilar applications under review see government regulation and price constraints — biosimilar regulation  below for additional information on the aca’s approval framework for biosimilars 

in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in 2013 the ema approved the first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody in japan the regulatory authority has granted marketing authorizations for certain biosimilars including our monoclonal antibody infliximab pursuant to a guideline for biosimilar approvals issued in 2009 

if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars that reference our biotechnology products our products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired however biosimilar manufacturing is complex at least initially upon approval of a biosimilar competitor biosimilar competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as generic competition with respect to small molecule drugs 

as part of our business strategy we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths to develop biosimilar medicines as such a betterdefined biosimilars approval pathway will assist us in pursuing approval of our own biosimilar products in the us see item 1a risk factors — biotechnology products  below 

we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products likewise as we develop and manufacture biosimilars and seek to launch products patents may be asserted against us 

international 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased biopharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products 

this competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in rd as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also seek to continually 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    11 

enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs we believe that we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

our consumer healthcare business faces competition from otc business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies and retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources customer acceptance product quality our and our competitors’ introduction of new products ingredients claims dosage forms or other forms of innovation and pricing regulatory and legislative matters such as product labeling patient access and prescription to otc switches 

our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines for example prevnar 13 may face competition in the form of alternative 13valent or additional valent nextgeneration pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents which may adversely affect our future results 

our generics and biosimilars businesses compete with branded products from competitors as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary and pfizer injectables team sell generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain competitors’ solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products respectively upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate additionally as a result of the hospira acquisition pfizer also sells generic versions of sterile injectable products as well as biosimilars globally we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “firsttomarket” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars as a “firsttomarket” position provides customers a lowercost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with a period of exclusivity as the only generic or biosimilar provider 

our infusion systems business faces competition from companies that manufacture and distribute similar products to our infusion systems for our infusion systems business we seek to differentiate our products through technological innovation and an integrated approach to drug delivery 

managed care organizations 

the evolution of managed care in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 283 million people in the us now have some form of health insurance coverage due to the expansion of health insurance coverage see government regulation and price constraints — in the united states  below the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the us continues to grow in importance 

the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate as well as their importance to pfizer 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures mcos typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine volume purchasing longterm contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs in addition by placing branded medicines on highertier status in their formularies leading to higher patient copays or nonpreferred tier status mcos transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient resulting in significant outofpocket expenses for the patient especially for chronic treatments this financial disincentive is a tool for mcos to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the mcos 

due to their generally lower cost generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of mco formularies the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    12 

universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies however increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a nonpreferred status 

mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

the aca has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration unlike us generic competitors often operate without large rd expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic competitors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute for brandname drugs generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs in a small subset of states prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2015  and none are expected in 2016  we have successfully secured the materials necessary to meet our requirements where there have been shortterm imbalances between supply and demand but generally at higher prices than those historically paid 

government regulation and price constraints 

pharmaceutical and medical device companies are subject to extensive laws and regulations by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business certain laws and regulations that govern pfizer’s business are discussed below 

general   our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our products could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmental bodies for additional information on these proceedings and actions see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings  in our 2015 financial report criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties warning letters and product recalls or seizures as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions could result from such proceedings and actions 

in the united states 

drug regulation   in the us biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre and postmarket regulations by the fda including regulations that govern the testing manufacturing safety efficacy labeling and storage of our products record keeping advertising and promotion our products are also subject to postmarket surveillance under the ffdca and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs as well as the public health service act and its implementing regulations with respect to biologics the fda also regulates our consumer healthcare products 

other us federal agencies including the dea also regulate certain of our products the ftc has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products including otc drugs and dietary supplements many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    13 

before a new biopharmaceutical product may be marketed in the us the fda must approve an nda for a new drug or a bla for a biologic the steps required before the fda will approve an nda or bla generally include preclinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the study sponsor sponsor submission of the application to the fda for review the fda’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness and the fda’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured 

before a generic drug may be marketed in the us the fda must approve an anda the anda review process typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the referenced drug previously approved through the nda process the anda process however does require the sponsor to conduct one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the anda drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved referenced brand drug submission of an application to the fda for review and the fda’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured 

as a condition of product approval the fda may require a sponsor to conduct postmarketing clinical studies known as phase 4 studies and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of the approved product the fda may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarket studies and programs any modifications to a drug or biologic including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities may require the submission and approval of a new or supplemental nda or bla before the modification can be implemented which may require that we develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs and biologics is subject to continuing regulation by the fda including recordkeeping requirements reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product and adherence to cgmps which regulate all aspects of the manufacturing process we are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics including but not limited to standards and regulations for directtoconsumer advertising failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions including warning letters product recalls or seizures injunctions fines civil penalties andor criminal prosecution 

biosimilar regulation  the aca created a framework for the approval of biosimilars also known as followon biologics following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic 

the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation and in 2015 approved the first biosimilar through that approval and the issuance of draft and final guidance the fda has begun to address open questions about the naming convention for biosimilars and the use of data from a nonuslicensed comparator to demonstrate biosimilarity andor interchangeability with a uslicensed reference product over the next several years the fda is expected to issue additional draft and final guidance documents impacting biosimilars 

device regulation  in the us the fda regulates medical devices under the authority of the ffdca and its regulations the fda classifies us medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the statutory framework described in the ffdca our medical device business includes class i and ii devices which are reviewed by the fda under the 510k process 

during the 510k process the fda reviews a premarket notification and determines whether or not a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to “predicate devices” if the intended use and technological characteristics are comparable to a predicate device the device may be cleared for marketing if the device has the same intended use as a predicate device and different technological characteristics but data is submitted to the fda showing that the device is at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed device it may also be cleared for marketing in reviewing a premarket notification the fda may request additional information including clinical data after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use requires a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the agency can review any such decision if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510k clearance the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510k clearance or premarket approval the fda can also require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained additionally the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 

postmarket device regulation   the medical devices that we manufacture and distribute are subject to continuing regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities the fda reviews design manufacturing and distribution practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experience and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices among other fda requirements we must comply with fda regulations relating to cgmps these regulations govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use we must also comply with medical devices reporting which requires us to report to the fda any incident in any of our products that may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or required an unnecessary intervention for a patient or in which any of our products malfunctioned and if such malfunction were to recur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury labeling advertising and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the ftc current fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses we are subject to routine inspection by the fda 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    14 

and other regulatory authorities for compliance with quality system regulation and medical devices reporting requirements as well as other applicable regulations if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of such devices and require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also impose operating restrictions enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal fines and penalties against our officers employees or us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice 

sales and marketing   the marketing practices of us biopharmaceutical and medical device companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs these laws include antikickback laws and false claims laws antikickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical or medical device company from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business including the purchase or prescription of a particular product false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to thirdparty payers including medicare and medicaid that are false or fraudulent although the specific provisions of these laws vary their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to any particular industry practices including the marketing practices of pharmaceutical and medical device companies violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions andor exclusion from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid the federal government and various states have also enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical or medical device companies the laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of such interactions andor require the adoption of compliance standards or programs many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations 

pricing and reimbursement   pricing for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program the 340b drug pricing program and the medicare part d program pfizer must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs such as the medicaid drug rebate program and medicare part b the calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose pfizer to penalties see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview section in our 2015 financial report and in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1g basis of presentation and significant accounting policies revenues and trade accounts receivable in our 2015 financial report which are incorporated by reference 

government and private thirdparty payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products for example the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under medicaid restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states as another example access to our products under the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises a growing number of states are considering a variety of costcontrol strategies including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments 

healthcare reform  the us and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry in march 2010 the us congress enacted the aca which included changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical and medical device industries such as 

 

 

 

 

the aca included provisions designed to increase the number of americans covered by health insurance specifically since 2014 the aca has required most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or potentially to pay a penalty for noncompliance and has offered states the option of expanding medicaid coverage to additional individuals the implementation of the coverage expansion had a negligible impact on pfizer’s 2015 revenues 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    15 

additionally policy efforts designed specifically to reduce patient outofpocket costs for medicines could result in new mandatory rebates and discounts or other pricing restrictions a number of the candidates for the 2016 us presidential elections have introduced such policy proposals and a november 2015 us department of health and human services forum dedicated to drug pricing could lead to further proposals we believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we continue to work with stakeholders in an effort to ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system in addition certain regulatory changes to be implemented in 2016 may affect pfizers obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program but the impact of those changes is not yet known 

adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand for or pricing of our products 

anticorruption   the fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries 

new drug approvals and pharmacovigilance  in the eu the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the mutual recognition procedure the decentralized procedure or the eu centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the eea countries norway iceland and liechtenstein the use of these procedures generally provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

in japan the pmda is the point of entry for businesses looking to sell drugs and medical devices in the country the pmda which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities including clinical studies approvals postmarketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety must approve an application before a new drug product may be marketed in japan the pmda also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and medical devices and provides advice on product classifications and approvals 

health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority ie similar to the authority of the fda or the ema before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval these requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the us and europe 

china’s regulatory system is unique in many ways and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with us or other international standards it is common to see treatments entering the chinese market two to five years behind first marketing in the us and europe because china only issues import drug licenses to treatments approved by a foreign regulatory authority in addition to obtain marketing approvals for new drugs in china a clinical trial authorization issued by the cfda is required for the conduct of phase i to iii clinical trials foreign applicants of imported drugs if including chinaoriginated data in their multiregional clinical trials and meeting the relevant technical review requirements may receive casebycase clinical trial waivers generics on the other hand only need to undergo bioequivalence studies upon a filing for record with the cfda a chinese drug license will only be granted if following review the cfda determines that the clinical data confirm the drug’s safety and effectiveness 

in 2012 new pharmacovigilance legislation came into force in the eu key changes include the establishment of a new pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee within the ema with responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the eu authorities it also introduces the possibility for regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization efficacy studies at the time of approval or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products outside developed markets such as the eu and japan pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are typically less extensive 

medical device regulation the eu has adopted the european medical device directives as a common legal framework for all eu member states these directives require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system and safety requirements and obtain a “ce” marking ie a mandatory conformity marking for certain products sold within the eea for their products the applicable authorities of the eu countries generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market we are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner various penalties exist for noncompliance with the laws implementing the european medical device directives 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    16 

medical device laws and regulations similar to those described above are also in effect in many of the other countriesregions in which we distribute our medical device products 

pricing and reimbursement  in certain international markets such as europe japan china canada and south korea governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global economic pressures governments including the different eu member states may use a variety of costcontainment measures for our pharmaceutical products including price cuts mandatory rebates valuebased pricing and international reference pricing ie the practice of many countries linking their regulated medicine prices to those of other countries this international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in different countries and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

in particular international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation price variations also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations that are exacerbated by international reference pricing systems the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies emergency measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries and ongoing exchange rate fluctuations 

china historically controlled prices of pharmaceutical products mainly by setting their maximum retail prices since june 1 2015 governmentset price caps have been lifted for the vast majority of drug products however the government will continue to exercise indirect price control by setting reasonable reimbursement standards determined by the social insurance administrations through a negotiation mechanism between drug manufacturers and social insurance administrations 

eu regulatory changes   the eu adopted a new clinical trials regulation in may 2014 which is expected to come into effect by december 2017 this new regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the eu and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results 

in another effort to increase the public availability of clinical trial results the ema adopted a new policy on publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use which became effective january 1 2015 under this policy the ema will proactively publish clinical trial data from application dossiers for new marketing authorizations including data from trials taking place outside the eu after the ema has made a decision on the marketing authorization the policy includes limited exceptions for commercially confidential information and the exclusion of any protected personal data 

china regulatory changes   in an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce the existing drug approval backlogs the cfda unveiled several reform initiatives for china’s drug approval system the regulator now divides drugs into new drugs and generics with the definition for new drugs changed from “drugs never marketed in china” to “drugs that are neither marketed in or outside china” this change in definition creates more incentives for china’s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms because imported drugs first marketed outside china are no longer considered new drugs another major initiative is the piloting of the “marketing authorization holder” system in ten provinces in china where the market authorizationdrug license holders are no longer required to be the actual manufacturers the “marketing authorization holder” system will allow for more flexibilities in contract manufacturing arrangements and asset transfers but it is not applicable to imported drugs 

a number of other policy changes are expected to be able to streamline and accelerate domestic and imported drug approvals in china these changes include introducing an umbrella clinical trial authorization for all three phases of registration studies instead of the original phasebyphase approvals implementing a filingrecordation system for bioequivalence studies on generics instead of the original review and approval system and admitting more types of drugs as innovative drugs eligible for the fast trackgreen channel approval pathway 

healthcare provider transparency and disclosures   a number of countries have implemented laws requiring or their industry associations have recommended disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical and medical device companies to healthcare providers for example in 2013 the efpia released its disclosure code of transfers of value to healthcare professionals and organizations the code requires all members of efpia including pfizer to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations beginning in 2016 covering the relevant transfers in 2015 

intellectual property   the wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2033 for leastdeveloped countries while we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world a number of countries have made improvements we include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries 

while the global intellectual property environment has improved following wtotrips and bilateralmultilateral trade agreements our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in emerging market countries in particular governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries there is considerable political and economic pressure to weaken existing intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which has led to policies such 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    17 

as more restrictive standards and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions eg new medical treatment methods revocation of patents issuance of compulsory licenses weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries 

canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity eight years plus sixmonth pediatric extension but it lacks the predictability and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide through intense negotiations as part of the canadaeu comprehensive economic  trade agreement canadian authorities committed to introduce a right of appeal a form of patent term restoration and to elevate the current data protection to a treaty obligation further aligning its intellectual property regime to the eu canada is also signatory of the 2015 transpacific trade partnership tpp and canada may enhance its intellectual property regime in line with its tpp obligations the patent utility doctrine developed by the canadian courts remains an important concern which is currently not being addressed by the canadian government 

in china the intellectual property environment has improved although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with world trade organization provisions and several companies including pfizer have established rd centers in china due to increased confidence in china’s intellectual property environment despite this china remained on the us trade representative’s priority watch list for 2015 further the standards for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in other major markets including the us europe and japan also while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent for example the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage 

in brazil and other latin american countries the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents eg national health surveillance agency in brazil restrictive patentability rules ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions such as new medical uses of drug products may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products 

in india policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents the increasing tendency of the indian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to protect many of our inventions india maintains a system of pregrant patent oppositions that delays the granting of patents and adds an additional challenge in our ability to protect our products through patents indian law includes special restrictions on the types of pharmaceutical inventions that may be patented which may limit our ability to protect our products recent use by the indian government of compulsory licensing and patent revocation mechanisms heightens the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population such as infectious diseases cancer and diabetes in september 2012 pfizer’s patent covering sutent was revoked by the indian patent office and other challenges against pfizer patents are ongoing 

in south korea the laws and regulations for the patentregulatory approval linkage system was implemented as part of the uskorea free trade agreement in 2012 the korean patentregulatory approval linkage system includes biologics 

environmental matters 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a3 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—commercial and other matters  in our 2015  financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2015  for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with laws related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

climate change presents risks to our operations including potential physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to more frequent and severe weather events and water availability we cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future however we have a robust program for reviewing our vulnerability to these potential risks and we update our assessments periodically to date we have concluded that because of

risks related to our business industry and operations  

managed care trends 

consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private insurers private thirdparty insurers as well as governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue in addition to formulary tier copay differentials private health insurance companies and selfinsured employers have been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products this cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medication choices as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us payer market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form biopharmaceutical 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    20 

companies may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues the date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time which can adversely affect our business a number of our current innovative products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years 

also the patents covering several of our medicines including sutent  epipen  toviaz   tygacil extendedrelease capsules and precedex premix  in the us are being challenged by generic manufacturers our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering several of their products that may impact our licenses or copromotion rights to such products in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products including new product entrants inline branded products generic products private label products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our inline drugs and drug candidates the introduction of competitive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence products that compete with ours including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

we also produce generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with branded products from competitors as well as other generic and biosimilar manufacturers the ability to launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before generic or biosimilar market formation is important to that product’s profitability prices for products typically decline sometimes dramatically following market formation as additional companies receive approvals to market that product and competition intensifies if a company can be “firsttomarket” such that the branded drug is the only other competition for a period of time higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved until other competitors enter the market with increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product market the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products will increase in importance if we are unable to bring our generic or biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure “firsttomarket” positions our sales and profit opportunities could be adversely impacted 

dependence on key inline products 

we recorded direct product revenues of more than 1 billion for each of seven biopharmaceutical products prevnarprevenar 13  lyrica  enbrel  lipitor  viagra  sutent and the premarin  family of products as well as more than 1 billion in alliance revenues primarily eliquis  in 2015 those products and alliance revenues accounted for 44  of our total revenues in 2015 if these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection if applicable changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years including some of our billiondollar and previously billiondollar products and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are or have been the subject of pending legal challenges for example in december 2014 generic versions of celebrex  became available pursuant to settlement agreements with several generic manufacturers in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights — recent losses and expected losses of product exclusivity section in our 2015 financial report 

further our alliance revenues have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and copromotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook –– our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights — recent losses and expected losses of collaboration rights section in our 2015 financial report 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    21 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity as well as to provide for earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers either through internal rd or through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties however balancing current growth investment for the future and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in rd for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth 

additionally our rd investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipeline could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the science may not work for any given program despite the significant investment required for rd and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement 

we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time there can be no assurance that these strategies will deliver the desired result which could affect profitability in the future 

biotechnology products 

abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow the expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period that has expired we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products 

we are developing biosimilar medicines the evolving pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products by the fda and regulatory authorities in certain other countries could diminish the value of our past and future investments in biosimilars other risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products there is also a risk of lower prescriptions of biosimilars due to potential concerns over comparability with innovator medicines 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities once the drug receives regulatory approval for example more detailed studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process but each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit and the potential delays to approval of the primary indication we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably foresee and address challenges but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time the degree to which these challenges are foreseen and addressed could affect our future results 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of developed markets leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s global performance as a result we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets including the full integration of emerging markets into each of our three operating segments gip voc and gep however there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that these countries will continue to sustain these growth rates in addition some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending which as discussed above can adversely affect our results 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    22 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products has generated payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector while the impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has had limited impact on pfizer to date a number of factors may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future given our growing specialty business portfolio these include the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world us pbms seeking to negotiate greater discounts deteriorating finances of certain governments and the uptake of biosimilars as they become available 

consumer healthcare 

the consumer healthcare business may be impacted by economic volatility the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal reformulation andor relabeling of certain products eg coughcold products see the global economic environment  risk factor below 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions shutdowns approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions or shortages reputational harm product liability unanticipated costs or otherwise examples of such difficulties or delays include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network andor comply with cgmps and other applicable regulations such as serialization which allows for track and trace of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety risks to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or manmade disasters at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor including those that may be related to climate change or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration product diversion product theft and counterfeit goods 

regulatory agencies periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cgmp requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions such as suspension of manufacturing seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 

outsourcing and enterprise resource planning 

we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial execution nonclinical research safety services and other areas for example in 2015 we placed the majority of our clinical trial execution services with four strategic clinical research organizations cros service performance issues with these cros may adversely impact the progression of our clinical trial programs outsourcing of services to third parties could also expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables which may result in missed deadlines or other timeliness issues supply disruptions noncompliance including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our results 

we continue to pursue a multiyear initiative to outsource some transactionprocessing activities within certain accounting processes and are migrating to a consistent enterprise resource planning system across the organization these are enhancements of ongoing activities to support the growth of our financial shared service capabilities and standardize our financial systems if any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of our enterprise resource planning system were to occur they could adversely affect our operations including among other ways through a failure to meet demand for our products or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations 

collaborations and other relationships with third parties 

we depend on thirdparty collaborators service providers and others in the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into joint ventures and other business development transactions in connection with our business to achieve expected longer term benefits we may make substantial upfront payments in such transactions which may negatively impact our reported earnings we rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development and commercialization activities but we do not control many aspects of those activities third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to pfizer or any disruption in the relationships between pfizer and these third parties could delay or prevent the development approval or commercialization of our products and product candidates and 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    23 

could also result in noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business 

difficulties of our wholesale distributors 

in 2015 our largest wholesale distributor accounted for approximately 14 of our total revenues and 30 of our total us revenues and our top three wholesale distributors accounted for approximately 34 of our total revenues and 74 of our total us revenues if one of our significant wholesale distributors should encounter financial or other difficulties such distributor might decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we might be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through collaborations alliances licenses joint ventures equity or debtbased investments   mergers and acquisitions however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions including the pending combination with allergan in the anticipated timeframe or at all and integrate acquisitions further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess additionally we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions including the possibility that expected synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time frame 

counterfeit products 

a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicines can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual patients the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of underregulated wholesalers and repackagers the importation of medicines across borders and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters further laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact our business by among other things causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation 

we undertake significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines including among other things working with the fda and other regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicines implementing business practices designed to protect patient health promoting public policies intended to hinder counterfeiting working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines and working collaboratively with wholesalers pharmacies customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and repackagers no assurance can be given however that our efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase 

risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings  

pricing and reimbursement 

us and international governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies 

in the us many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures pharmaceutical and medical device product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform some states have implemented and other 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    24 

states are considering pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible private thirdparty payers such as health plans increasingly challenge pharmaceutical and medical device product pricing which could result in lower prices lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets healthcare provider purchasers directly or through group purchasing organizations are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in certain international markets such as europe japan china canada and south korea governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to patients and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system and we have seen governmentmandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs in those markets particularly under recent global economic pressures as a result we expect that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue 

the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions failure to obtain timely or adequate governmentapproved pricing or formulary placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccines business we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business 

us healthcare reformhealthcare legislation 

the us healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes for example the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and its provisions become effective on various dates we expect that the rebates discounts taxes and other costs resulting from the aca over time will have a significant effect on our expenses and profitability in the future see the discussion under the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — regulatory environmentpricing and access — us healthcare legislation  section in our 2015 financial report and in item 1 business  under the caption government regulation and price constraints—in the united states  we also face the uncertainties that might result from any modification repeal or invalidation of any of the provisions of the aca there is no assurance that the aca as currently enacted or as amended in the future will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business in addition certain regulatory changes to be implemented in 2016 may affect pfizer’s obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program but the impact of those changes is not yet known 

other us federal or state legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect our business including among others changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 

us deficitreduction actions 

any significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented andor any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us as part of any broad deficitreduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

substantial regulation 

we are subject to extensive complex costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the us principally by the fda and the dea and foreign regulatory authorities failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution monetary penalties and other disciplinary actions including sanctions warning letters product seizures recalls fines injunctions suspension revocation of approvals or exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

innovation is critical to the success of our company the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process including as the result of unfavorable preclinical and clinical trial results including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data there can be no assurance regarding our ability to meet anticipated preclinical and clinical trial commencement 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    25 

and completion dates regulatory submission and approval dates and launch dates for product candidates or as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products which will depend on the assessment by regulatory authorities of the benefitrisk profile suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products there is no assurance that we will be able to address the comments in complete response letters received by us with respect to certain of our drug applications to the satisfaction of the fda any of our late stage pipeline products will receive regulatory approval andor be commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets andor be commercially successful there is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings should they occur in addition there are risks associated with interim data including the risk that final results of studies for which interim data have been provided andor additional clinical trials may be different from including less favorable than the interim data results and may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication 

there are many considerations that can affect the marketing of our products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete or adequately design and implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that can adversely affect the realization of rd and productrelated forwardlooking statements further claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in a negative impact on product sales product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the riskbenefit profile of products as they relate to alreadyapproved products has resulted in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for among other things additional clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies 

in addition failure to put in place adequate controls andor resources for effective collection reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance in compliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety regulatory actions and risks to product sales 

the fda along with other regulatory agencies around the world has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications which has delayed approvals of new generic products these delays have become longer and while the fda has stated that it is taking steps to address the backlog of pending applications continued approval delays may be experienced by generic drug applicants over the next few years 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase 4 trials could result in the loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product regulatory agencies in countries outside the us often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate or are perceived to implicate an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on the availability or commercial potential of the affected products accordingly new data about our products or products similar to our products could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in updated labeling restrictions on use product withdrawal or recall

in 2014 the fda issued a final guidance document entitled “infusion pumps total product life cycle” through this final guidance the fda has established additional premarket requirements for infusion pumps at the same time the fda is also generally enhancing its premarket requirements for medical devices although we cannot predict with certainty the future impact of these initiatives it appears likely that the process for obtaining regulatory approvals to market infusion pumps and medical devices will become more costly and time consuming 

interactions with healthcare professionals and government officials 

risks and uncertainties apply if we provide something of value to a healthcare professional andor government official if the interaction is found to be improper government enforcement actions and penalties could result these risks may increase as nonus jurisdictions adopt or increase enforcement efforts of new antibribery laws and regulations 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    26 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including among others changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including tax rate changes new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals competition laws privacy laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities antitrust environmental employment and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all of our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations 

like other pharmaceutical companies we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the us other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate as a result we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis criminal charges and substantial fines andor civil penalties as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions could result from government investigations 

our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this 2015 form 10k as well as antikickback and false claims laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions like many companies in our industry we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as by consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries for example these claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

environmental claims and proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims and proceedings amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accruals for contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks related to intellectual property  

patent protection 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our branded products using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinctive patent laws we 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    27 

may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including among others claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term 

our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as a result of local political pressure or in the case of national emergencies in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights most of the suits by generic drug manufacturers involve claims that patents covering our products processes or dosage forms are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer also counterclaims as well as various independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of or attempts to enforce our patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition andor violations of antitrust laws in various jurisdictions we are party to other patent damages suits pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers payers governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry related to patent enforcement litigation further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

third party intellectual property claims 

a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted such challenges may include negotiation and litigation which may not be successful 

part of our established products business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities which may involve litigation associated costs and time delays and may ultimately not be successful these opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired where patents have been declared invalid or where products do not infringe the patents of others to achieve a “firsttomarket” or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars we may take action such as litigation asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable 

third parties may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and timeconsuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launches and may result in significant damages we are involved in patentrelated disputes with companies over our attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic pharmaceuticals we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings have not been resolved if those proceedings ultimately determine that our products infringe the patent rights of another company we may face damages including a requirement to pay a reasonable royalty or the lost profits from the sale of the branded product remedies also may include or consist of an injunction preventing us from further manufacture or sales of the affected product for a period of time any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

risk related to technology  

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our businesses in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including but not limited to personal information and intellectual property and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    28 

maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems and those of our thirdparty vendors with whom we contract and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal groups “hacktivists” nation states and others as a global pharmaceutical company our systems are subject to frequent attacks due to the nature of some of these attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

risks related to our strategic transactions  

hospira acquisition 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of hospira 

the success of our acquisition of hospira will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our businesses anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the integration process may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business including thirdparty relationships or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies we also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction in addition hospira has experienced manufacturing disruptions device remediations and increased regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues future manufacturing problems as well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs 

pending combination with allergan 

we and allergan must obtain required shareholder approvals and governmental and regulatory consents to consummate the merger which if delayed or not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions may prevent delay or impair the consummation of the merger result in additional expenditures of money and resources andor reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger 

on november 23 2015 we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with allergan under which we have agreed to combine with allergan completion of the proposed transaction with allergan is subject to certain closing conditions including among others the receipt of required approvals of our shareholders and allergan shareholders clearance of the merger by certain governmental and regulatory authorities including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act and other filings or approvals as may be required pursuant to the antitrust and competition laws of certain foreign jurisdictions including the eu the governmental agencies with which we and allergan will make these filings and seek certain of these approvals and consents have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations we can provide no assurance that all required approvals and consents will be obtained moreover as a condition to their approval of the transaction certain governmental agencies may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the business of the combined company after the closing of the merger any one of these requirements limitations costs divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the effective time of the merger or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction further no assurance can be given that the required shareholder approvals will be obtained or that the required closing conditions will be satisfied and if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied no assurance can be given as to the terms conditions and timing of the approvals or clearances finally the closing of the merger is subject to the closing of allergan’s pending divestiture of its generics business to teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd which itself is subject to certain closing conditions including receipt of governmental and regulatory consents and no assurance can be given that the closing of such divestiture will occur on a timely basis or at all if we and allergan agree to any requirements limitations costs divestitures or restrictions in order to obtain any approvals or clearances required to consummate the transaction these requirements limitations costs divestitures or restrictions could adversely affect the integration of the two companies’ operations andor reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger in addition future potential changes to the tax laws if adopted prior to closing could give rise to a right of pfizer or allergan to terminate the merger agreement the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in a failure to consummate the merger or have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company 

if the merger is not completed for any reason we may be subjected to a number of material risks the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed in 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    29 

addition some costs related to the merger must be paid whether or not the merger is completed we may also experience negative reactions from our shareholders customers and employees in addition in specified circumstances we could be required to reimburse expenses of allergan or pay allergan a termination fee of up to 35 billion 

while the merger is pending we and allergan will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our respective businesses and operations these uncertainties could also adversely affect the combined company following the completion of the merger 

uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on us and allergan these uncertainties may impair our or allergan’s ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter and could cause customers suppliers and others who deal with us or allergan to seek to change existing business relationships with us andor allergan employee retention may be challenging during the pendency of the merger as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles if key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses the business of the combined company following the merger could be seriously harmed 

in addition until the merger is completed the merger agreement restricts us and allergan from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party these restrictions may among other things prevent us or allergan from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected the combined company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend to a large extent on the combined company’s ability to integrate the two businesses the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with allergan’s business practices and operations the integration process may be disruptive to the businesses and if implemented ineffectively may restrict the full realization of expected benefits the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company 

in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors are outside of our control andor will be outside the control of the combined company and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company in addition even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully the full benefits of the merger may not be realized including the anticipated synergies cost savings and sales or growth opportunities these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses as well as prior to the consummation of the combination all of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined company decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and negatively impact the price of the combined company ordinary shares as a result it cannot be assured that the pending combination with allergan will result in the full realization of the benefits anticipated from the transaction within the anticipated time frames or at all 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    30 

in addition although the combined company is expected under current law to be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes the irs may not agree with this treatment even if treated as a foreign corporation certain adverse tax consequences may apply to the combined company that could erode some of the synergies expected from the combination similarly future changes in tax law could affect the combined company’s status as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes or could otherwise materially and adversely affect some of the synergies expected from the combination any such changes in law or treatment by the irs could have prospective or retroactive application and may apply even if enacted or asserted after the merger is consummated moreover various us federal and state legislative and other proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies and subsidiaries of us companies that move or have moved their corporate location abroad may affect pfizer if adopted any such changes in law or treatment by the irs or other governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on the anticipated results of the operations of the combined company 

finally our expectations regarding the timing and amount of accretion following consummation of the merger reflect the impact of anticipated share repurchases by us the actual timing and size of any such share repurchases will depend on actual and expected financial results and the sufficiency of distributable reserves as well as assessments at the time regarding capital allocation alternatives reduced or delayed share repurchase activity may result in less accretion 

our shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the consideration they will receive in the merger and may receive a form of consideration different from what they elect our shareholders will receive ordinary shares of the combined company as a result of the allergan merger which have rights different from shares of our common stock and our preferred shares 

because the market price of allergan ordinary shares and shares of our common stock will fluctuate our shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the consideration they will receive in the merger in addition because the exchange ratio is fixed the number of ordinary shares of the combined company to be received by holders of pfizer common stock in the merger will not change between now and the time the merger is completed to reflect changes in the trading prices of pfizer common stock or allergan ordinary shares share repurchases or other factors furthermore although our shareholders will be entitled to elect to receive allergan ordinary shares or cash consideration for their shares of our common stock such elections will be subject to proration procedures set forth in the merger agreement such that our existing shareholders will receive in the aggregate no less than 6 billion and no more than 12 billion in cash and therefore our existing shareholders may receive a form of consideration different from what they elect 

upon completion of the allergan merger the rights of our existing shareholders who receive allergan ordinary shares which will become the ordinary shares of the combined company will be governed by the memorandum of association and articles of association of allergan which subject to the amendments contemplated by the merger agreement will become the memorandum of association and articles of the combined company and by irish law the rights associated with shares of our common stock and our preferred shares are different from the rights associated with these ordinary shares in addition the laws of ireland differ from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of securities in the combined company 

finally it is expected that our existing shareholders as a group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 56 of the outstanding ordinary shares of the combined company on a fully diluted basis immediately following the effective time of the merger based on the closing price of pfizer common stock and certain other assumptions as of november 20 2015 as a result our shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management 

the market value of our common stock may be adversely affected as a result of financial statement charges and cash costs associated with our proposed transaction with allergan 

we expect to account for the proposed merger using the acquisition method of accounting which will result in charges to our earnings that could adversely affect our reported operating results under this method we will allocate the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from allergan based on their fair values as of the date of the completion of the proposed merger and record any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill for certain tangible and intangible assets reevaluating fair value as of the completion date of the proposed merger will result in pfizer incurring additional depreciation andor amortization expense that exceed the combined amounts recorded by pfizer and allergan prior to the proposed merger this increased expense will be recorded by us over the useful lives of the underlying assets in addition to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets were to become impaired we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the integration process the substantial majority of such expenses will be composed of transaction costs facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs although certain additional costs may be incurred as well such as potential costs related to litigation seeking to prevent the proposed transaction we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    31 

integration of the businesses will allow us to more than offset incremental transaction and integrationrelated costs over time but this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

other risks 

the global economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses are exposed to the economic cycle which impacts our biopharmaceutical operations globally we believe that patients who are experiencing increases in copays and restrictions on access to medicines as payers seek to control costs sometimes switch to generic products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments we are exposed to negative pricing pressure in various markets around the world the us has highly competitive insurance markets europe japan china canada south korea and a number of other international markets have governmentmandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global economic pressures furthermore some government agencies and thirdparty payers use health technology assessments in ways that at times lead to restricted access to and lower prices for new medicines 

the global economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate it will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources due to our significant operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as market conditions change we continue to monitor our liquidity position however there can be no assurance that possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources or impact our ability to obtain financing in the future we continue to monitor the credit and economic situations in several international markets including venezuela and greece where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain we cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in these economic conditions or what impact they may have on our results of operations financial condition or business 

other potential impacts of variations in the economic cycle include declining sales increased costs changes in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of or a lower rate of return on our financial assets and pension plan investments which may require us to increase our pension funding obligations adverse government actions delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

foreign exchange and interest rate risk 

significant portions of our revenues and earnings as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 56  of our total 2015 revenues were derived from international operations including 23 from europe and 20 from japan and the rest of asia as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the uk pound the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses if the us dollar were to weaken against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would increase having a positive impact on earnings and our overall expenses would increase having a negative impact on earnings conversely if the us dollar were to strengthen against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would decrease having a negative impact on earnings and our overall expenses would decrease having a positive impact on earnings therefore significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results and financial guidance for example in february 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from an official rate of 43 to 63 of venezuelan currency to the us dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 we resolved that our venezuela bolivardenominated net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation are no longer expected to be settled at the 63 rate but at the simadi rate of 200 resulting in a foreign currency loss news reports state the venezuelan government announced that effective february 18 2016 the official rate of 63 would be replaced by a rate of 100 and the operation of the simadi rate would change   see the analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources—global economic conditions––venezuela operations  section in our 2015 financial report for more information 

in addition our interestbearing investments and borrowings and our pension benefit obligations net and our postretirement benefit obligations net are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section in our 2015 financial report for additional details see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7e financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and — note 11 pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans in our 2015 financial report and the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions––benefit plans  section in our 2015 financial report those sections of our 2015 financial report are incorporated by reference 

pfizer inc     2015 form 10k    32 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

cost and expense controlunusual eventsfailure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitionsintangible assets goodwill and equitymethod investments 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings internal reorganizations product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of i our costreduction and productivity initiatives ii our internal separation of our commercial operations into our current operating structure iii any other corporate strategic initiatives iv any acquisitions divestitures or other initiatives such as our recent acquisition of hospira and v our pending combination with allergan 

in addition our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future for goodwill all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity any such charge may be significant our other intangible assets including developed technology rights and brands face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assets may be significant as well for additional details see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions  section in our 2015 financial report 

we also regularly review our equitymethod investments for impairment an impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments we may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment events related to particular customers or asset types challenging market conditions or decisions by management 

internal control over financial reporting 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures could undermine the ability to provide accurate disclosure including with respect to financial information on a timely basis which could cause investors to lose confidence in our disclosures including with respect to financial information require significant resources to remediate the lapse or deficiency and expose us to legal or regulatory proceedings 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas

internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act and the related report of our independent registered public accounting firm are included in our 2015  financial report under the headings management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  and report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting  respectively and are incorporated by reference pfizer acquired hospira on september 3 2015 and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of pfizer’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 hospira’s and its subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of 242 billion and total revenues of 15 billion included in the consolidated financial statements of pfizer inc and subsidiary companies as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 

changes in internal controls 

during our most recent fiscal quarter management remediated an identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for the elimination of intercompany profit in inventory and certain other intercompany accounts no restatement of prior period financial statements and no change in previously released financial results were required as a result of this finding for the reporting period ended december 31 2015 management remediated the material weakness by enhancing and adding additional reconciliation and review controls over the accounting for intercompany profit in inventory and certain other intercompany accounts the company will continue to monitor these new controls and implement additional enhancements in 2016 

except for the foregoing there was no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act in the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting we continue to integrate hospira’s operations into our internal control over financial reporting none of these integration activities are expected to have a material impact on our system of internal control over financial reporting

commercial operations 

at the beginning of our fiscal year 2014 we began managing our commercial operations through a new global commercial structure consisting of two distinct businesses an innovative products business and an established products business the innovative products business is composed of two operating segments the global innovative pharmaceutical segment gip and the global vaccines oncology and consumer healthcare segment voc the established products business consists of the global established pharmaceutical segment gep each operating segment is led by a single manager and has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain inprocess research and development iprd projects for new investigational products and additional indications for inline products that generally have achieved proof of concept each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets 

some additional information about each product grouping follows 

innovative products business 

 

 

established products business 

 

we expect that the gip and voc biopharmaceutical portfolios of innovative largely patentprotected inline products will be sustained by ongoing investments to develop promising assets and targeted business development in areas of focus to ensure a pipeline of highlydifferentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need the assets managed by these groups are sciencedriven highly differentiated and generally require a highlevel of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers 

gep is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective lowercost highvalue treatments gep leverages our biologic development regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio in addition gep may also engage in targeted business development to further enable its commercial strategies 

for a further discussion of these operating segments including priorperiod information that has been conformed to the current commercial structure as well as comparative segment information for 2014 2013 and 2012 see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  including the tables therein captioned selected income statement information   geographic information and significant product revenues  the table captioned revenues by segment and geographic area and the analysis of operating segment information  section in our 2014 financial report which are incorporated by reference 

biopharmaceutical products 

in 2014 our biopharmaceutical business was managed through gip gep and the vaccines and oncology businesses of voc which are discussed under commercial operations  above 

for a discussion of certain of our key biopharmaceutical products including lyrica  the prevnar  family of products enbrel  celebrex  lipitor  viagra  zyvox  sutent   norvasc    the premarin  family of products eliquis  and xeljanz  see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions  section in our 2014 financial report 

we have entered into collaboration andor copromotion agreements relating to certain biopharmaceutical products including aricept  enbrel in the us and canada spiriva  and rebif  each of which has expired or will expire in various markets over the next several years for additional information including a description of these collaboration and copromotion agreements and their expiration dates see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions  and the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights sections in our 2014 financial report and item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products below 

in addition eliquis  was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with bristolmyers squibb company bms for additional information see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions  section in our 2014 financial report 

revenues from biopharmaceutical products contributed approximately 92  of our total revenues in 2014  93  of our total revenues in 2013  and 94  of our total revenues in 2012  

we recorded direct product sales of more than 1 billion for each of 10 biopharmaceutical products in 2014  2013  and 2012  these products represented 54  of our revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2014 51  of our revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2013 and 50  of our revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2012 see item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products  below 

worldwide revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2014  were 457 billion  a decrease of 5  compared to 2013  reflecting a decrease in operational revenues of 3  and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2  

geographically in the us revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 8  in 2014  compared to 2013  in our international markets revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 3  in 2014  compared to 2013  which primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange during 2014  international revenues from biopharmaceutical products represented 62  of total revenues from biopharmaceutical products compared to 61  in 2013  

for additional information including a discussion of key operational revenue drivers see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical revenues — revenues—major biopharmaceutical products and —biopharmaceutical—selected product descriptions sections in our 2014 financial report 

consumer healthcare 

based on 2014 revenues our consumer healthcare business is the fifthlargest branded multinational otc healthcare products business in the world and produces two of the ten largest selling consumer healthcare brands  centrum  and advil  in the world consumer healthcare revenues totaled 34 billion  for 2014 an increase of 3  compared to 2013 reflecting operational revenue growth of 5  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2  

the consumer healthcare business holds strong positions in various geographic markets with its highest revenue volume in the us china canada germany italy and brazil 

major categories and product lines in our consumer healthcare business include 

 

in august 2012 we entered into an agreement with astrazeneca plc astrazeneca for the exclusive global otc rights for nexium  a leading prescription drug currently approved to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease in december 2011 we completed our acquisition of the consumer healthcare business of ferrosan a danish company engaged in the sale of sciencebased consumer healthcare products including dietary supplements and lifestyle products primarily in the nordic region and the emerging markets of russia and central and eastern europe for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 2a acquisitions licensing agreements collaborative arrangements divestitures and equitymethod investments  acquisitions and — note 2b acquisitions licensing agreements collaborative arrangements divestitures and equitymethod investments licensing agreements in our 2014 financial report and the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our business development initiatives  section in our 2014 financial report

research and development 

innovation by our research and development rd operations is very important to our success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs we spent 84 billion  in 2014  67 billion  in 2013  and 75 billion  in 2012  on rd 

biopharmaceutical rd 

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines through collaborations alliance and license agreements acquisitions and other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable according to the pharmaceutical benchmarking forum out of 30 compounds entering preclinical development only one is approved by a regulatory authority in a major market us the european union eu or japan the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than 10 years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

as of yearend 2014 we had 298 projects in rd ranging from discovery through registration of which 86 programs are in phase 1 through registration with the remainder of the projects in preclinical development at yearend 2014 our phase 3 portfolio contained 23 programs development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our rd operations seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering new indications for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income—product developments — biopharmaceutical  section in our 2014 financial report which is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to rd we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence see item 1a risk factors — competitive products  below 

we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time our rd priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for longterm leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity to that end our research primarily focuses on six highpriority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules — immunology and inflammation cardiovascular and metabolic diseases oncology vaccines neuroscience and pain and rare diseases another area of focus is biosimilars 

for additional information regarding our rd operations see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our strategy—research operations and  costs and expenses—research and development rd expenses — description of research and development operations sections in our 2014 financial report 

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the us in 2014 for developed and emerging markets these operations were managed through our three operating segments gip gep and voc a significant change effected by our new structure is the full integration of emerging markets into each business emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastestgrowing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets in 2013 our pharmaceutical operations in emerging markets were managed through our former emerging markets business unit and our operations in developed markets were managed together with our us operations through our other pharmaceutical business units our consumer healthcare operations were managed worldwide in 2013 for additional information regarding our operating segments see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our strategy  section in our 2014 financial report and commercial operations  above 

revenues from operations outside the us of 305 billion  accounted for 62  of our total revenues in 2014  revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 13  12 and 14 countries outside the us in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the us is our largest national market comprising 38  of total revenues in 2014 and 39  of total revenues in 2013 and 2012 japan is our secondlargest national market with approximately 9 10 and 12 of total revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

for a geographic breakdown of revenues see the table captioned geographic information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  in our 2014 financial report and the table captioned revenues by segment and geographic area  in our 2014 financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

our international operations are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors — risks affecting international operations  below our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws and regulations on pricing reimbursement and access to our products see government regulation and price constraints — outside the united states  below for a discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments depending upon market conditions for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7e financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2014 financial report as well as the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section in our 2014 financial report those sections of our 2014 financial report are incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical businesses we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists and the managed care organizations mcos that provide insurance coverage such as hospitals integrated delivery systems pharmacy benefit managers pbms health plans employers and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies and in the case of prevnar 13  in the us we primarily sell directly to individual provider offices the centers for disease control and prevention and wholesalers we seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and mco formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos mcos use various benefit designs such as tiered copays for formulary products to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions we also work with mcos to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

during 2014 pfizer revenues from our three largest biopharmaceutical wholesalers in the us were as follows 

 

sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the biopharmaceutical businesses 

our global consumer healthcare business utilizes its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products and occasionally uses distributors in smaller markets our consumer healthcare business’s advertising and promotions are generally disseminated to consumers through television print digital and other media advertising as well as through instore promotion consumer healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies retail chains and grocery and convenience stores our consumer healthcare business generates a significant portion of its sales from several large customers the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the consumer healthcare business 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance to pfizer trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can 

vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country further patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period andor the granted patent term extension are those for the medicines set forth in the table below patent term extensions supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration date listed in the table below unless they have been granted by the issuing authority in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions to methods of manufacturing or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect our drug from generic or as applicable biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

  



1  in addition to the basic product patent covering viagra  which expired in 2012 viagra  is covered by a us methodoftreatment patent which including the sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period associated with revatio which has the same active ingredient as viagra  expires in 2020 however as a result of a patent litigation settlement teva pharmaceuticals usa inc will be allowed to launch a generic version of viagra  in the us in december 2017 or earlier under certain circumstances the corresponding methodoftreatment patent covering viagra  in japan expired in may 2014 

2  pfizer does not market enbrel  in the us for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our operating environment—industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights section in our 2014 financial report in other markets biosimilar competition will depend to a significant extent on the timing and implementation of regulations governing the development and approval of biosimilar products 

3  we obtained a reissue patent in the us in march 2013 covering the approved uses of celebrex  the reissue patent expires in december 2015 this patent is presently the subject of litigation between pfizer and several generic companies in december 2014 generic versions of celebrex  became available pursuant to settlement agreements licensing the reissue patent to several of the generic manufacturers involved in the ongoing litigation 

4 for lyrica  regulatory exclusivity in the eu expired during 2014 

5 xeljanz  is not approved in the eu 

6 eliquis  was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with bms 

7   ibrance  is not approved in the eu or japan 

8  the eu patent that covers the combination of the 13 serotype conjugates of prevenar   13  has been revoked following an opposition proceeding this first instance decision will be appealed there are other eu patents and pending applications covering the formulation and various aspects of the manufacturing process of prevenar   13  that remain in force 

we copromote aricept  with eisai aricept  has experienced patentbased expirations in many major markets since 2010 for additional information including a description of certain of our other copromotion agreements and their expiration dates see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions  and the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights sections in our 2014 financial report and item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products below 

a number of our current products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years for example in the us we lost exclusivity for geodon  in march 2012 revatio tablet in september 2012 rapamune  in january 2014 detrol la  in january 2014 and celebrex  in december 2014 pursuant to terms of a settlement agreement certain formulations of zyvox  became subject to generic competition in the us in january 2015 we expect certain other formulations of zyvox  will become subject to generic competition in the us in the first half of 2015 in most major european markets we lost exclusivity for xalatan and  xalacom  in january 2012  detrol la  in september 2012 viagra in june 2013 inspra  in march 2014 lyrica  in july 2014 and celebrex  in november 2014 we lost exclusivity for lyrica  in canada in february 2013 lipitor has lost exclusivity in all major markets and now faces multisource generic competition in the us europe japan and australia 

for additional information including a further discussion of our products experiencing or expected to experience in 2015 patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in various markets see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights section in our 2014 financial report 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products viagra  celebrex  sutent  epipen  toviaz and  tygacil  extendedrelease capsules  for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a1 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—patent litigation  in our 2014 financial report 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to otc products 

biotechnology products 

our biotechnology products including benefix  refacto  xyntha  and enbrel  we market enbrel  outside the us and canada may face competition in the future from biosimilars also referred to as followon biologics in the us such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a followon recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin  which was approved under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act 

abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the heath care and education reconciliation act commonly referred to as the affordable care act or aca a framework for such approval exists in the us the regulatory implementation of these aca provisions is ongoing and expected to take several years however the fda has begun to clarify its expectations for approval via the biosimilar pathway with the issuance of a number of draft guidance documents in 2014 the fda issued draft guidance on clinical pharmacology for biosimilars and reference product exclusivity for biologic products over the next several years the fda is expected to finalize these guidance documents and issue additional draft and final 

guidance documents the fda has also begun to accept biosimilar applications for review see government regulation and price constraints — biosimilars  below for additional information on the aca’s approval framework for biosimilars 

in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in 2013 the european medicines agency ema approved the first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody in japan the regulatory authority has granted marketing authorizations for certain biosimilars including the monoclonal antibody infliximab pursuant to a guideline for biosimilar approvals issued in 2009 

if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars that reference our biotechnology products our products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired however biosimilar manufacturing is complex and biosimilars are not generic versions of the reference products therefore at least initially upon approval of a biosimilar competitor biosimilar competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as generic competition with respect to small molecule drugs 

as part of our business strategy we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths to develop biosimilar medicines as such a betterdefined biosimilars approval pathway will assist us in pursuing approval of our own biosimilar products in the us see item 1a risk factors — biotechnology products  below 

we may face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue likewise as we enter the biosimilars area and seek to launch products patents may be asserted against us 

international 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased biopharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products 

this competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in rd as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs we believe that we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical 

education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

our consumer healthcare business faces competition from otc business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies as well as retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including among others the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources customer acceptance product quality our and our competitors’ introduction of new products ingredients claims dosage forms or other forms of innovation and pricing regulatory and legislative matters such as product labeling patient access and prescription to otc switches 

our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of next generation vaccines for example prevnar 13 may face competition in the form of alternative 13valent or additional valent nextgeneration pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents 

managed care organizations 

the evolution of managed care in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 281 million people in the us now have some form of health insurance coverage due to the expansion of health insurance coverage see government regulation and price constraints — in the united states  below both the marketing of prescription drugs to consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the us continue to grow in importance 

the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate as well as their importance to pfizer 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures mcos typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine volume purchasing longterm contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs in addition by placing branded medicines on highertier status in their formularies leading to higher patient copays or nonpreferred tier status mcos transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient resulting in significant outofpocket expenses for the patient especially for chronic treatments this financial disincentive is a tool for mcos to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the mcos 

due to their generally lower cost generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of mco formularies the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies 

mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

the aca has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration unlike us generic competitors often operate without large rd expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the body equivalent to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute for brandname drugs generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs in a small subset of states prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary and pfizer injectables sell generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain competitors’ solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products respectively upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2014 and none are expected in 2015 we have successfully secured the materials necessary to meet our requirements where there have been shortterm imbalances between supply and demand but generally at higher prices than those historically paid 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general  pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive laws and regulations by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance in the us is the fda which has jurisdiction over our biopharmaceutical products and administers requirements covering the testing approval safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of these products the fda also regulates our consumer healthcare products other federal agencies including the us drug enforcement administration also regulate some of our products 

before any of our biopharmaceutical products may be marketed in the us the fda needs to approve a new drug application or biologics license application for that product the steps required before the fda will approve an application include multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the study sponsor sponsor submission of the application to the fda for review the fda’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness and the fda’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured 

the marketing practices of all us pharmaceutical companies are subject to federal and state healthcare laws that are intended to protect the integrity of government healthcare programs the office of inspector general oig of the department of health and human services hhs oversees compliance with applicable federal healthcare laws including the federal antikickback statute which criminalizes the offering of something of value to induce the recommendation order or purchase of products reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and false claim laws the federal trade commission also has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products including otc drugs and dietary supplements many of our activities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the sec additionally the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries other countries 

have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

our business has been and will continue to be subject to these and various other us laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various governmental bodies see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 commitments and contingencies  in our 2014 financial report such actions may involve product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

healthcare reform  in march 2010 the aca was enacted in the us the principal provisions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry provide for the following 

 

the aca included a coverage expansion that took effect in 2014 health insurance exchanges were created by the aca to provide an opportunity for individuals without access to employer or other government sponsored coverage to purchase insurance from private health plans offering coverage compliant with aca mandated provisions states could choose to operate the health insurance exchange with a federal grant or defer operations to the federal government newly eligible patients enrolled either in medicaid or in a health insurance exchange plan the congressional budget office estimated that approximately 7 million americans gained medicaid coverage and hhs reported that 67 million americans were ultimately enrolled in health insurance exchange plans in 2014 

the aca specifies certain benefits and services that must be covered for health insurers to qualify to participate in the health insurance exchanges including prescription drugs in general health plans in the health insurance exchange offer benefits that are more restrictive than the typical large employer but more comprehensive than most catastrophic health insurance plans and some other limited policies available in the individual insurance marketplace this means that there are high deductibles and copays increased use of coinsurance fewer medicines on formularies and restricted networks of physicians and hospitals because of these factors health insurance exchange enrollment has had only a negligible impact on pfizer’s 2014 revenues 

the coverage expansion included funding for increased medicaid enrollment twentyseven states and the district of columbia opted to expand medicaid eligibility in 2014 because of the substantial mandatory rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies to the medicaid program and the formulary restrictions that limit access to brand name drugs in many states the medicaid expansion has also had only a negligible impact on pfizer’s 2014 revenues 

changes in disclosure of relationships with us physicians and teaching hospitals  the aca requires that biopharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers record transfers of value made to licensed us physicians and teaching hospitals and to initially disclose such data to hhs by march 2014 information provided by companies was aggregated and posted on the open payments website in september 2014 which is managed by the centers for medicare and medicaid services the agency responsible for implementing disclosure provisions of the aca in addition to civil penalties for failure to report transfers of value to physicians or teaching hospitals there will be criminal penalties if a manufacturer intentionally makes false statements or excludes information in such reports increased access to such data by fraud and abuse investigators industry critics and media will likely draw attention to our collaborations with reported entities and will importantly provide opportunities to underscore the critical nature of our collaborations for developing new medicines and exchanging scientific information this national payment transparency effort coupled with industry commitment to uphold voluntary codes of conduct such as the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma code on interactions with healthcare professionals and phrma guiding principles direct to consumer advertisements about prescription medicines  and rigorous internal training and compliance efforts will complement existing laws and regulations to help ensure ethical collaboration and truthful product communications 

biosimilars  the aca also created a framework for the approval of biosimilars also known as followon biologics following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation which will require the fda to address such key topics as 

 

   

 

 

 

in february 2012 the fda released three draft guidance documents in which it clarified that biosimilar applicants may use a nonuslicensed comparator in certain studies to demonstrate biosimilarity to a uslicensed reference product in 2014 the fda issued draft guidance on clinical pharmacology for biosimilars and reference product exclusivity for biologic products over the next several years the fda is expected to finalize these guidance documents and issue additional draft and final documents impacting biosimilars further clarity may also be provided as the fda begins to review biosimilar applications the first four of which were filed by other companies pursuant to the aca pathway in 2014 

medicaid and related matters  the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain medicines in medicaid restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states access in the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises a growing number of states are considering a variety of costcontrol strategies including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments 

pfizer must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by state medicaid agencies and certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview  section in our 2014 financial report and in the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 1g basis of presentation and significant accounting policies   revenues and   accounts receivable  in our 2014 financial report which are incorporated by reference 

sustainable growth rate replacement  the medicare physician payment formula known as the sustainable growth rate sgr is routinely overridden by congressional action because it would lead to dramatic decreases in physician payment the current legislative relief expires in march 2015 congress issued a bipartisan proposal to repeal the sgr and replace it with a new payment model this form of sgr replacement is estimated by the congressional budget office to cost the federal government approximately 144 billion over 10 years the source of those funds has yet to be determined but could include additional taxes on andor rebate requirements applicable to the pharmaceutical industry including pfizer 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries 

pricing and reimbursement  in europe japan china canada south korea and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global economic pressures in particular the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states so we continue to work with individual countries on such matters across the region this international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in different countries and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

the practice of many countries linking their regulated medicine prices to those of other countries ie international reference pricing irp adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation price variations have also resulted from exchange rate fluctuations that are exacerbated by irp systems the 

downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to irp policies emergency measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries and ongoing exchange rate fluctuations 

new drug approvals and pharmacovigilance  in the eu the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissionema centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the european economic area countries norway and iceland the use of these procedures generally provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority eg similar to the authority of the fda or the ema before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval these requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the us and europe 

china’s regulatory system is unique in many ways and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with us or other international standards as a result it is not uncommon to see treatments entering the market in china two to five years after first marketing in the us and europe 

in 2012 new pharmacovigilance legislation came into force in the eu key changes include the establishment of a new pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee within the ema with responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the eu authorities it also introduces the possibility for regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization efficacy studies at the time of approval or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products outside developed markets such as the eu and japan pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are typically less extensive 

clinical trials regulation  the new eu regulation on clinical trials was published in may 2014 and is expected to come into force at the earliest in may 2016 this new regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the eu particularly the processes for submission and approval of clinical trial applications which have been criticized as harming europe’s competitiveness in clinical rd of new medicines in line with the protransparency policy of the eu institutions the new regulation will also require increased public posting of clinical trial results 

clinical trial data sharing  in october 2014 the ema adopted its policy on the publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use which became effective on january 1 2015 under this policy the ema will for the first time proactively publish clinical data from application dossiers for new marketing authorizations subject to limited exceptions for commercially confidential information and the exclusion of any protected personal data this clinical data can be accessed via the ema’s website subject to the acceptance of terms of use which also includes disclosure that the data will be used only for noncommercial research purposes 

healthcare professional transparency and disclosures in 2013 the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations efpia released its disclosure code of transfers of value to healthcare professionals and organizations the code requires all members of efpia including pfizer to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations beginning in 2016 covering the relevant transfers in 2015 each member company will be required to document and disclose i the names of healthcare professionals and associations that have received payments or other transfers of value and ii the amounts or value transferred and the type of relationship 

intellectual property   

the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2021 for leastdeveloped countries while we still face enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world a number of countries have made improvements we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those countries we include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries 

while the global intellectual property environment has improved following wtotrips and bilateralmultilateral trade agreements our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in emerging market countries in particular governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines as well as to protect their national pharmaceutical industries there is considerable political pressure to weaken 

existing intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions eg new medical treatment methods revocation of patents issuance of compulsory licenses weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries 

canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity eight years but it lacks the predictability and stability that comparable countries provide through intense negotiations as part of the canadaeu comprehensive economic  trade agreement canadian authorities committed to introduce a right of appeal a form of patent term restoration and to elevate the current data protection to a treaty obligation further aligning its intellectual property regime to the eu canada also joined the ongoing negotiations of the transpacific trade partnership tpp and the tpp negotiations could further pressure canada to enhance its intellectual property regime the patent utility doctrine developed by the canadian courts remains an important concern which is currently not being addressed by the canadian government 

in china the intellectual property environment has improved although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with world trade organization provisions and several companies including pfizer have established rd centers in china due to increased confidence in china’s intellectual property environment despite this china remained on the us department of commerce priority watch list for 2013 further the standards for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in other major markets including the us europe and japan also while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent for example the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage 

in brazil and other latin american countries the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents eg national health surveillance agency anvisa in brazil restrictive patentability rules and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions such as new medical uses of drug products may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products 

in india policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents the increasing tendency of the indian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to protect many of our inventions india maintains a system of pregrant patent oppositions that delays the granting of patents and adds an additional challenge in our ability to protect our products through patents indian law includes special restrictions on the types of pharmaceutical inventions that may be patented which may limit our ability to protect our products recent use by the indian government of compulsory licensing and patent revocation mechanisms heightens the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population such as infectious diseases cancer and diabetes in september 2012 pfizer’s patent covering sutent was revoked by the indian patent office and other challenges against pfizer patents are ongoing 

in south korea the laws and regulations for the patentregulatory approval linkage system were finalized and are in the process of being implemented as part of the united stateskorea free trade agreement in 2012 the korean patentregulatory approval linkage system includes biologics 

environmental matters 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17 commitments and contingencies  in our 2014 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2014 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with laws related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we have no reason to believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

climate change presents risks to our operations including potential physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to more frequent and severe weather events and water availability we cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future however we have reviewed the potential for these risks and have concluded that because of our facility locations our existing distribution networks and our controls we do not believe these risks are material to pfizer in the near term

disclosure pursuant to section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra requires disclosure by public companies of certain transactions involving the government of iran as well as entities and individuals designated under executive order 13382 and executive order 13224 the executive orders in some instances itrshra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they were permissible under us law or were conducted by a nonus affiliate in accordance with the local law under which such entity operates 

as a global biopharmaceutical company we conduct business in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world during 2014 our activities included supplying lifesaving medicines medical products and consumer products pfizer products for patient and consumer use in iran we ship pfizer products to iran and conduct related activities in accordance with licenses issued by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and other us and nonus governmental entities and in line with our corporate policies we will continue our global activities to improve the health and wellbeing of patients and consumers in a manner consistent with applicable laws and our corporate policies to our knowledge none of our activities during 2014 are required to be disclosed pursuant to itrshra

pricing pressures and government regulation 

us and international governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies 

in the us many of our biopharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures have increased as a result of the 2003 medicare modernization act 2003 mma and the aca due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of beneficiaries in addition if the 2003 mma or the aca were amended to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions it would have a significant adverse impact on our business furthermore mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts 

some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including among others changes in patent laws the importation of drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by governments of foreign countries restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines in addition pricing pressures may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe japan china canada south korea and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system and we have seen governmentmandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs in those markets particularly under recent global economic pressures as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions failure to obtain timely or adequate governmentapproved pricing or formulary placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccines business we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business 

managed care trends 

consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private insurers private thirdparty insurers as well as governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue in addition to formulary tier copay differentials private health insurance companies and selfinsured employers have been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products this cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medication choices as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us payer market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

us healthcare reformhealthcare legislation 

the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and its provisions become effective on various dates with the medicaid and health insurance exchange coverage expansion effective in 2014 we expect that the rebates discounts taxes and other costs resulting from the aca over time will have a significant effect on our expenses and profitability in the future see the discussion under the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — regulatory environmentpricing and access — us healthcare legislation  section in our 2014 financial report and in item 1 business  under the caption government regulation and price constraints—in the united states  furthermore the independent payment advisory board ipab which was created by the aca to reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending could potentially limit access to certain treatments or mandate price controls for our products though the ipab has not yet been named and the congressional budget office does not expect that the threshold for ipab recommendations will be exceeded in the near future moreover expanded government investigative authority may increase the costs of compliance with new regulations and programs we also face the uncertainties that might result from any modification repeal or invalidation of any of the provisions of the aca one major provision of the aca is currently under review by the supreme court of the united states scotus which has agreed to hear a case known as king v burwell  during the 2015 session the case challenges the extension of premium subsidies to health insurance policies purchased through federallyfacilitated health insurance exchanges arguing that subsidies must be limited to stateoperated health insurance exchanges if decided in favor of the plaintiffs this case could make it more difficult for uninsured individuals in states that do not operate a health insurance exchange to purchase coverage and otherwise significantly affect implementation of the aca in a manner that results in less than projected numbers of newly insured individuals we expect that a decision by scotus in this case would have a negligible impact on our revenues given that the stateoperated health 

insurance exchanges and the federallyfacilitated health insurance exchanges are projected to account for minimal new pfizer revenue even with fully available subsidies for the reasons discussed in item 1 business  under the caption government regulation and price constraints — in the united states  

us deficitreduction actions 

any significant spending reductions affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented andor any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us as part of any broad deficitreduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues the date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time which can adversely affect our business a number of our current products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years 

also the patents covering several of our medicines including viagra  celebrex  sutent  epipen  toviaz and tygacil extendedrelease capsules in the us are being challenged by generic manufacturers our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering several of their products that may impact our licenses or copromotion rights to such products in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products which can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence products that compete with ours including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

dependence on key inline products 

we recorded direct product revenues of more than 1 billion for each of 10 biopharmaceutical products in 2014 lyrica  the prevnar  family of products enbrel  celebrex  lipitor  viagra  zyvox  sutent  norvasc  and the premarin  family of products those products accounted for 54 of our total biopharmaceutical revenues in 2014 if these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years including some of our billiondollar and previously billiondollar products and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges for example on december 10 2014 generic versions of celebrex  became available pursuant to settlement agreements licensing the reissue patent to several generic manufacturers in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products 

further our alliance revenues have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and copromotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time for example our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim for spiriva  has expired in major markets us the eu canada and australia and is expiring in other markets through 2016 the copromotion term of our us and canada collaboration agreement with amgen inc amgen for enbrel  expired in october 2013 our exclusive rights to enbrel outside the us and canada are not affected by the expiration of the copromotion term of the collaboration agreement with amgen and our collaboration agreement with emd serono inc to copromote rebif in the us will expire at the end of 2015 see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our operating environment — industryspecific challenges — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights and analysis of the consolidated 

statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions sections in our 2014 financial report for additional information on the expirations of these agreements 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products and the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity as well as to provide for earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers either through internal rd or through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties however balancing current growth investment for the future and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in rd for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a corresponding increase in revenues 

additionally our rd investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipeline could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the science may not work for any given program despite the significant investment required for rd 

we continue to strengthen our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time there can be no assurance that these strategies will deliver the desired result which could affect profitability in the future 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process including as the result of unfavorable clinical trial results there can be no assurance regarding our ability to meet anticipated clinical trial commencement and completion dates regulatory submission dates and launch dates for product candidates or as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products which will depend on the assessment by regulatory authorities of the benefitrisk profile reflected by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products and there is no assurance that any of our late stage pipeline products will receive regulatory approval andor be commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets andor be commercially successful there is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings should they occur in addition there are risks associated with interim data including the risk that final results of studies for which interim data have been provided andor additional clinical trials may be different from including less favorable than the interim data results and may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication 

there are many considerations that can affect the marketing of our products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete or adequately design and implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that can adversely affect the realization of rd and productrelated forwardlooking statements further claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in a negative impact on product sales product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the riskbenefit profile of products as they relate to alreadyapproved products has resulted in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for among other things additional clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies 

in addition failure to put in place adequate controls andor resources for effective collection reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance in compliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety regulatory actions and risks to product sales 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase 4 trials could result in loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product regulatory agencies in countries outside the us often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect sales of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate or are perceived to implicate an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of the affected products accordingly new data about our products or products similar to our products could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in updated labeling restrictions on use product withdrawal or recall 

patent protection 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our products using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinctive patent laws we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including among others claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term 

our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as a result of local political pressure or in the case of national emergencies in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or thirdparty objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted such challenges may include negotiation and litigation which may not be successful 

biotechnology products 

abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow the expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired we may face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue 

we are developing biosimilar medicines the developing pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products in the us could diminish the value of our past and future investments in biosimilars other risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products there is also a risk of lower prescriptions of biosimilars due to potential concerns over comparability with innovator medicines 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities once the drug receives regulatory approval for example more detailed studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process but each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit and the potential delays to approval of the primary indication we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably foresee and address challenges but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time the degree to which these challenges are foreseen and addressed could affect our future results 

foreign exchange and interest rate risk 

significant portions of our revenues and earnings as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 62  of our total 2014 revenues were derived from international operations including 27 from europe and 21 from japan and the rest of asia as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the uk pound the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses if the us dollar were to weaken against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would increase having a positive impact on earnings and our overall expenses would increase having a negative impact on earnings conversely if the us dollar were to strengthen against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would decrease having a negative impact on earnings and our overall expenses would decrease having a positive impact on earnings therefore significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results and financial guidance for example in february 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 of venezuelan currency to the us dollar see the analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources—global economic conditions––venezuela operations  section in our 2014 financial report for more information 

in addition our interestbearing investments and borrowings and our pension benefit obligations net and our postretirement benefit obligations net are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section in our 2014 financial report for additional details see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 7e financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and — note 11 pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans in our 2014 

financial report and the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions––benefit plans  section in our 2014 financial report those sections of our 2014 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of developed markets leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s global performance as a result we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets including the full integration of emerging markets into each of our three operating segments — the global innovative pharmaceutical segment  the global vaccines oncology and consumer healthcare segment  and the global established pharmaceutical segment  however there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that these countries will continue to sustain these growth rates in addition some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending which as discussed above can adversely affect our results 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products has generated payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector while the impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has had limited impact on pfizer to date a number of factors may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future given our growing specialty business portfolio these include the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world us pbms seeking to negotiate greater discounts deteriorating finances of certain governments and the uptake of biosimilars as they become available 

consumer healthcare 

the consumer healthcare business may be impacted by economic volatility the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal reformulation andor relabeling of certain products eg coughcold products see the global economic environment  below 

the global economic environment 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses are exposed to the economic cycle which impacts our biopharmaceutical operations globally we believe that patients who are experiencing increases in copays and restrictions on access to medicines as payers seek to control costs sometimes switch to generic products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments we are exposed to negative pricing pressure in various markets around the world the us has highly competitive insurance markets europe japan china canada south korea and a number of other international markets have governmentmandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global economic pressures furthermore some government agencies and thirdparty payers use health technology assessments in ways that at times lead to restricted access to and lower prices for new medicines 

the global economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate it will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources due to our significant operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as market conditions change we continue to monitor our liquidity position however there 

can be no assurance that possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources or impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

other potential impacts of variations in the economic cycle include declining sales increased costs changes in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of or a lower rate of return on our financial assets and pension plan investments which may require us to increase our pension funding obligations adverse government actions delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

outsourcing 

we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial execution nonclinical research safety services and other areas in 2014 we continued to place the majority of our clinical trial execution services with two strategic clinical research organizations cros and we also utilized another cro to execute early phase development studies service performance issues with these cros may adversely impact the progression of our clinical trial programs outsourcing of services to third parties could also expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery which may result in missed deadlines supply disruptions noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our results 

we continue to pursue a multiyear initiative to outsource some transactionprocessing activities within certain accounting processes and are migrating to a consistent enterprise resource planning system across the organization these are enhancements of ongoing activities to support the growth of our financial shared service capabilities and standardize our financial systems if any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of the new system were to occur they could adversely affect our operations including among other ways through a failure to meet demand for our products or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations 

collaborations and other relationships with third parties 

we depend on thirdparty collaborators service providers and others in the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into joint ventures and other business development transactions in connection with our business to achieve expected longer term benefits substantial upfront payments in such transactions may negatively impact our reported earnings we rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development and commercialization activities but we do not control many aspects of those activities third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to pfizer or any disruption in the relationships between pfizer and these third parties could delay or prevent the development approval or commercialization of our products and product candidates and could also result in noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business 

interactions with healthcare professionals and government officials 

risks and uncertainties apply where we provide something of value to a healthcare professional andor government official which if found to be improper could potentially result in government enforcement actions and penalties these risks may increase as nonus jurisdictions adopt or increase enforcement efforts of new antibribery laws and regulations 

difficulties of our wholesale distributors 

in 2014 our largest wholesale distributor accounted for approximately 13 of our total revenue and 34 of our total us revenue and our top three wholesale distributors accounted for approximately 32 of our total revenue and 84 of our total us revenue if one of our significant wholesale distributors should encounter financial or other difficulties such distributor might decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we might be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions shutdowns approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions or shortages reputational harm product liability unanticipated costs or otherwise examples of such difficulties or delays include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable 

and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network andor comply with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulations such as serialization which allows for track and trace of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety risks to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or manmade disasters at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor including those that may be related to climate change or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration product diversion product theft and counterfeit goods 

regulatory agencies periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable current good manufacturing practices requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions such as suspension of manufacturing seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 

counterfeit products 

a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicines can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual patients the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of underregulated wholesalers and repackagers the importation of medicines across borders and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters further laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact our business by among other things causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation 

we undertake significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines including among other things working with the fda and other regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicines implementing business practices designed to protect patient health promoting public policies intended to hinder counterfeiting working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines and working collaboratively with wholesalers pharmacies customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and repackagers no assurance can be given however that our efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase 

cost and expense controlunusual eventsfailure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitionsintangible assets and goodwill 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings internal reorganizations product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of i our costreduction and productivity initiatives including those related to our rd organization ii our internal separation of our commercial operations into our new operating structure iii any other corporate strategic initiatives iv any acquisitions divestitures or other initiatives and v our proposed acquisition of hospira 

in addition our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets will ultimately yield successful products the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is 

often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future for goodwill all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity any such charges may be significant our other intangible assets including developed technology rights and brands face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assets may be significant as well 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including among others changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including tax rate changes new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals competition laws privacy laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities antitrust environmental employment and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this 2014 form 10k as well as antikickback and false claims laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions like many companies in our industry we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as by consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries for example these claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

in connection with the resolution of certain us government investigations concerning various products in september 2009 we entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of inspector general oig while the compliance obligations expired on december 31 2014 certain reporting requirements with respect to those compliance obligations continue into 2015 and a material failure to comply with the cia through the end of its term could result in severe sanctions against us pursuant to the cia penalty provisions these penalty provisions will expire once the oig officially notifies pfizer that its final report to the oig is complete and that the oig has no further questions the deferred prosecution agreement which one of our subsidiaries entered into with the us department of justice in august 2012 and in connection with the resolution of foreign corrupt practices act matters also expired in 2014 

claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through acquisitions licensing and alliances see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our business development initiatives  section in our 2014 financial report which is incorporated by reference however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions including the hospira acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all and integrate acquisitions further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess 

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our businesses in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including but not limited to personal information and intellectual property and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems and those of our thirdparty vendors with whom we contract and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal groups “hacktivists” nation states and others as a global pharmaceutical company our systems are subject to frequent attacks due to the nature of some of these attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

environmental claims and proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims and proceedings amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accruals for contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

hospira acquisition 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition 

the success of our proposed acquisition of hospira will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our businesses the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the proposed acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the integration process may for each company result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies if the proposed acquisition is not completed our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected 

the required shareholder and regulatory approvals may not be obtained or the regulatory approvals may contain materially burdensome conditions that could have an adverse effect on us 

completion of the proposed acquisition is conditioned upon the approval of hospira’s shareholders and the receipt of certain governmental approvals including without limitation the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended as well as the receipt of all regulatory clearances under the antitrust laws of several other jurisdictions including the eu although pfizer and hospira have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder and governmental approvals there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained and that the other conditions to closing will be satisfied in addition the governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the proposed acquisition or require changes to the terms of the proposed acquisition under the terms of the merger agreement we are required if necessary to receive antitrust approval to make divestitures of assets so long as such divestitures would not result in the sale of assets of either us or hospira that generated revenue in excess of 450 million during the twelve months ended september 30 2014 failure to complete the proposed acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

the market value of our common stock may be adversely affected as a result of financial statement charges and cash costs associated with the proposed transaction 

we could encounter transaction and integrationrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize benefits anticipated from the proposed transaction which could negatively impact the projected financial consequences of the proposed transaction 

we expect to account for the proposed merger using the acquisition method of accounting which will result in charges to our earnings that could adversely affect our reported operating results under this method we will allocate the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from hospira based on their fair values as of the date of the completion of the proposed merger and record any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill for certain tangible and intangible assets reevaluating fair value as of the completion date of the proposed merger will result in pfizer incurring additional depreciation andor amortization expense that exceed the combined amounts recorded by pfizer and hospira prior to the proposed merger this increased expense will be recorded by us over the useful lives of the underlying assets in addition to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets were to become impaired we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the integration process the substantial majority of such expenses will be comprised of transaction costs facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs although certain unanticipated costs may be incurred as well such as potential costs related to litigation seeking to prevent the proposed acquisition we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will allow us to more than offset incremental transaction and integrationrelated costs over time but this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all

commercial operations 

following the full disposition of our animal health business on june 24 2013 we managed our commercial operations through four operating segments — primary care specialty care and oncology established products and emerging markets and consumer healthcare prior to june 24 2013 we managed our operations through these four operating segments as well as our animal health operating segment for additional information about this operating structure see notes to consolidated financial statements — note 18a segment geographic and other revenue information segment information in our 2013 financial report and operating segments  below 

at the beginning of our fiscal year 2014 we began to manage our commercial operations through a new global commercial structure consisting of three businesses each of which is led by a single manager — the global innovative pharmaceutical business  gip the global vaccines oncology and consumer healthcare business  voc and the global established pharmaceutical business  gep 

beginning with our firstquarter 2014 financial results we will report under our new structure and will provide financial transparency into each of these businesses results for 2013 and prior periods in this 2013 form 10k and in our 2013 financial report are reported on the basis under which we managed our businesses in 2013 and do not reflect the 2014 reorganization 

a significant change effected by our new structure is the full integration of emerging markets into each business emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership and our new structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastestgrowing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets 

some additional information about each product grouping follows 

 

 

 

we expect that the gip and voc biopharmaceutical portfolios of innovative largely patentprotected inline products will be sustained by ongoing internal investments and targeted business development designed to maximize the value of our inline products and ensure a robust pipeline of highlydifferentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need in addition voc includes our consumer healthcare business which manufactures and markets several wellknown overthecounter otc brands the assets managed by these groups are sciencedriven highly differentiated and generally require a highlevel of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers 

gep is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective lowercost highvalue treatments gep leverages our biologic development regulatory and manufacturing expertise to advance its biosimilar development portfolio gep may also engage in targeted business development to further enable its commercial strategies 

in addition one of our goals in implementing the new commercial structure is to streamline the critical capabilities needed to effectively demonstrate the value of our medicines to payers institutions and policy makers we expect to do this through the global health and value function that is intended to align market access pricing health economics real world data and outcomes research

research and development 

innovation by our rd operations is very important to our success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs we spent 67 billion  in 2013  75 billion  in 2012  and 87 billion  in 2011  on rd 

biopharmaceutical rd 

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines through collaborations alliance and license agreements acquisitions and other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable according to the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma out of 500010000 screened compounds only 250 enter preclinical testing five enter human clinical trials and one is approved by the fda the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than 10 years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

as of yearend 2013 we had 279 projects in rd ranging from discovery through registration of which 81 programs are in phase 1 through registration with the remainder of the projects in preclinical development at yearend 2013 our phase 3 portfolio contained 20 programs development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple different programs while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses or indications for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — product developments — biopharmaceutical  section of the mda in our 2013 financial report which is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to rd we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence see item 1a risk factors — competitive products  below 

we continue to transform our global rd organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time our rd priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for longterm leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity to that end our research primarily focuses on five highpriority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules — immunology and inflammation oncology cardiovascular and metabolic diseases neuroscience and pain and vaccines other areas of focus include rare diseases and biosimilars

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments depending upon market conditions for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 7e financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2013 financial report as well as the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section of the mda in our 2013 financial report those sections of our 2013 financial report are incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical businesses we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists and the managed care organizations mcos that provide insurance coverage such as hospitals integrated delivery systems ids pharmacy benefit managers pbms health plans employers and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies and in the case of prevnar 13  in the us we primarily sell directly to individual provider offices we seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and mco formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos mcos use various benefit designs such as tiered copays for formulary products to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions we also work with mcos to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

during 2013 pfizer revenues from our three largest biopharmaceutical wholesalers were as follows 

 

sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the biopharmaceutical businesses 

our global consumer healthcare business utilizes its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products and occasionally uses distributors in smaller markets our consumer healthcare business’s advertising and promotions are generally disseminated to consumers through television print digital and other media advertising as well as through instore promotion consumer healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies retail chains and grocery and convenience stores our consumer healthcare business generates a significant portion of its sales from several large customers the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the consumer healthcare business 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance to pfizer trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country further patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period andor the granted patent term extension are those for the medicines set forth in the table below in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions to methods of manufacturing or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect our drug from generic or as applicable biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

  



1  in addition to the basic product patent covering viagra  which expired in 2012 it is covered by a us methodoftreatment patent which including the sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period associated with revatio  which has the same active ingredient as viagra  expires in 2020 however as a result of a patent litigation settlement teva pharmaceuticals usa inc will be allowed to launch a generic version of viagra  in the us in december 2017 or earlier under certain circumstances the corresponding methodoftreatment patent covering viagra  in japan expires in may 2014 

2  pfizer does not market enbrel  in the us for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our operating environment—intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights section of the mda in our 2013 financial report in other markets biosimilar competition will depend to a significant extent on the timing and implementation of regulations governing the development and approval of biosimilar products 

3  we obtained a reissue patent in the us on march 5 2013 covering the approved uses of celebrex  the reissue patent expires on december 2 2015 this patent is presently the subject of litigation between pfizer and several generic companies 

4 for lyrica  regulatory exclusivity in the eu extends until 2014 

5 bosulif  is not approved in japan 

6 xeljanz  is not approved in the eu 

7 eliquis  was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with bms 

8 prevnar 13 may eventually face competition in the form of alternative 13valent and nextgeneration pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 

we copromote aricept  with eisai we lost exclusivity for aricept  5mg and 10mg tablets in the us in november 2010 and in the majority of european markets in february 2012 and april 2012 we lost exclusivity for the aricept  23mg tablet in the us in july 2013 for additional information including a description of certain of our other copromotion agreements and their expiration dates see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions  and the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our operating environment — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights sections of the mda in our 2013 financial report and item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products below 

a number of our current products have lost exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years for example in the us we lost exclusivity for geodon  in march 2012 revatio tablet in september 2012 and rapamune  in january 2014 we lost exclusivity for xalatan  and xalacom  in the majority of european markets in january 2012 and australia in july 2012 we lost exclusivity in the us for detrol  immediate release  detrol ir  in june 2012 and detrol la  in january 2014 detrol ir  and detrol la  lost exclusivity in most european markets in september 2012 viagra lost exclusivity in most major eu markets in june 2013 we lost exclusivity for lyrica  in canada in february 2013 lipitor has lost exclusivity in all major markets and now faces multisource generic competition in the us europe japan and australia 

for additional information including a further discussion of our recent losses of exclusivity and associated revenues in various markets and of our expected losses of exclusivity in 2014 see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our operating environment — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights section of the mda in our 2013 financial report 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products viagra  celebrex  lyrica  sutent  epipen  pristiq  toviaz  tygacil  and embeda extendedrelease capsules and our patent for lipitor  in china is subject to a pending legal challenge  for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements— note 17a1 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—patent litigation  in our 2013 financial report 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to otc products 

biotechnology products 

our biotechnology products including benefix  refacto  xyntha   enbrel  we market enbrel  outside of the us and canada and the prevnar  family may face competition in the future from biosimilars also referred to as followon biologics such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a biosimilar recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin  which was approved under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act 

abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the heath care and education reconciliation act commonly referred to as the affordable care act or aca a framework for such approval exists in the us the regulatory implementation of these aca provisions is ongoing and expected to take several years however the fda has begun to clarify its expectations for approval via the biosimilar pathway with the issuance of three draft guidance documents in february 2012 over the next several years the fda is expected to finalize the guidance documents released in 2012 and issue new draft guidance on clinical pharmacology for biosimilars see government regulation and price constraints — biosimilars  below for additional information on the aca’s approval framework for biosimilars 

in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in 2013 the european medicines agency ema approved the first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody in japan the regulatory authority has 

granted marketing authorizations for certain biosimilars including somatropin the recombinant human growth hormone in our genotropin  product pursuant to a guideline for biosimilar approvals issued in 2009 

if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars that reference our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired however biosimilar manufacturing is complex and biosimilars are not necessarily identical to the reference products therefore at least initially upon approval of a biosimilar competitor biosimilar competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as generic competition with respect to small molecule drugs 

as part of our business strategy we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths to develop biosimilar medicines as such a betterdefined biosimilars approval pathway will assist us in pursuing approval of our own biosimilar products in the us see item 1a risk factors — biotechnology products  below 

we may face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue likewise as we enter the biosimilars area and seek to launch products patents may be asserted against us 

international 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2016 for leastdeveloped countries while we still face enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world a number of countries have made improvements we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those countries we include further patent protection improvement among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased biopharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and consumer healthcare manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products 

this competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in rd as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs we believe that we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

our consumer healthcare business faces competition from otc business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies as well as retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including among others the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources customer acceptance product quality our and our competitors’ introduction of new products ingredients claims dosage forms or other forms of innovation and pricing regulatory and legislative matters such as product labeling patient access and prescription to otc switches 

managed care organizations 

the evolution of managed care in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 262 million people in the us now have some form of health insurance coverage due to the expansion of health insurance coverage see government regulation and price constraints — in the united states  below both the marketing of prescription drugs to consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the us continue to grow in importance 

the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate as well as their importance to pfizer 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures mcos typically use formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the mcos clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine volume purchasing longterm contracts and their ability to influence market share and volume of prescription drugs to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers 

due to their generally lower cost generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of mco formularies the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies 

mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

the aca has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration unlike us generic competitors often operate without large rd expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the body equivalent to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute for brandname drugs generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary and pfizer injectables sell generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain competitors’ solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products respectively upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2013 and none are expected in 2014 we have successfully secured the materials necessary to meet our requirements where there have been shortterm imbalances between supply and demand but generally at higher prices than those historically paid 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general  pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance in the us is the fda which has jurisdiction over our biopharmaceutical products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of these products the fda also regulates our consumer healthcare products other federal agencies including the us department of agriculture and the us drug enforcement administration also regulate some of our products 

in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services hhs office of the inspector general oig the federal trade commission ftc which also has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products including otc drugs and dietary supplements the department of justice doj and the sec individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various governmental bodies see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 17 commitments and contingencies  in our 2013 financial report such actions may involve product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

healthcare reform  in march 2010 the aca was enacted in the us the principal provisions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry provide for the following 

 

as of may 2013 the congressional budget office estimates that the aca will result in the coverage of 25 million previously uninsured individuals by 2017 effective in 2014 nonmedicare eligible individuals with incomes below 138 of the federal poverty level fpl are eligible for medicaid if they live in one of the 25 states that elected to expand the program using federal funds the remainder will be covered with private sector coverage either through their employers the individual insurance marketplace or new state or federal health insurance exchanges enacted through the aca health insurance exchanges with limited exceptions individuals who fail to purchase health insurance by march 31 2014 will pay a penalty starting in 2015 employers with 100 or more employees who do not provide affordable and qualifying coverage will also pay a penalty beginning in 2016 employers with between 50 and 99 employees who do not provide affordable and qualifying coverage will be penalized individuals with incomes between 100400 of the fpl will be eligible for subsidies to help pay for health insurance coverage in the health insurance exchanges 

the health insurance exchanges were created by the aca to provide an opportunity for individuals without access to employer or other government sponsored coverage to purchase insurance from private health plans offering coverage compliant with aca mandated provisions states could choose to operate the health insurance exchange with a federal grant or defer operations to the federal government regardless of the facilitator the health insurance exchanges offer similar coverage federal and state health insurance exchange websites opened for enrollment on october 1 2013 and experienced computer access difficulties the separate website for the small business exchanges shop was delayed until late 2014 for states utilizing the federal health insurance exchange coverage began on january 1 2014 and enrollment remains open until march 31 2014 

the aca specifies certain benefits and services that must be covered for health insurers to qualify to participate in the health insurance exchanges including prescription drugs in general health plans in the health insurance exchange offer benefits that are more restrictive than the typical large employer but more comprehensive than most catastrophic health insurance plans and some other limited policies available in the individual insurance marketplace this means that there are high deductibles and copays increased use of coinsurance fewer medicines on formularies and restricted networks of physicians and hospitals expanding insurance coverage is expected to result in a negligible change in overall pharmaceutical industry sales as the uninsured are principally young and relatively healthy and it is expected that a significant percentage may be covered by medicaid under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates and in many states to formulary restrictions limiting access to brandname drugs including ours and the restrictive benefit designs discourage the use of branded drugs at the same time the rebates discounts taxes and other costs associated with the aca are a significant cost to the industry 

the aca created the independent payment advisory board ipab a 15member panel to be appointed by the president the ipab is charged with developing proposals to “reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending” in the event that the actual medicare per capita growth rate exceeds a specified target due to slow growth in healthcare spending that did not exceed the target per capita growth rate the ipab will not be required to act until 2016 at the earliest to date the ipab’s members have not been named or appointed 

the aca also established the patient centered outcomes research institute pcori a federally funded private nonprofit corporation empowered to fund and disseminate comparative effectiveness research cer and build infrastructure for improved outcomes analysis pcori has no authority to impose formulary changes directly in governmentfunded health programs in 2013 pcori announced that it will issue a new type of funding for pragmatic headtohead comparison studies as well as plans to develop a national clinical research data network both developments are expected to increase the availability of medical evidence related to healthcare interventions overseeing and managing the pcori is an advisory board drawn from multiple and varied stakeholder organizations including the pharmaceutical industry pfizer’s chief medical officer currently serves as an industry representative on the advisory board 

changes in marketing activity disclosure  the aca expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse including amendments to both the false claims act and the antikickback statute to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes the aca also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud with expanded subpoena power for hhs additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement 

as of august 2013 biopharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are required to record any transfers of value made to licensed physicians and teaching hospitals and to disclose such data to hhs with the initial disclosure to hhs due no later than march 31 2014 in addition to civil penalties for failure to report transfers of value to physicians or teaching hospitals there will be criminal penalties if a manufacturer intentionally makes false statements or excludes information in such reports the payment data across biopharmaceutical and medical device companies will be posted by hhs on a publicly available website no later than september 30 2014 increased access to such data by fraud and abuse investigators industry 

critics and media will draw attention to our collaborations with reported entities and will importantly provide opportunities to underscore the critical nature of our collaborations for developing new medicines and exchanging scientific information this national payment transparency effort coupled with industry commitment to uphold voluntary codes of conduct such as the phrma code on interactions with healthcare professionals and phrma guiding principles direct to consumer advertisements about prescription medicines  and rigorous internal training and compliance efforts will complement existing laws and regulations to help ensure ethical collaboration and truthful product communications 

medicare  elderly and disabled beneficiaries have access to the medicare drug benefit through private plans approved by the federal government beneficiaries with low incomes and modest assets are eligible for assistance with medicare part d plan premiums and cost sharing nationally the share of such beneficiaries with comprehensive drug coverage increased from 59 in 2005 to approximately 90 in 2011 

the aca made some important changes to the medicare drug benefit including phasing out the medicare coverage gap by 2020 prior to the aca beneficiaries who reached a certain level of spending on prescription medications the medicare part d coverage gap or “doughnut hole” had to pay 100 of the cost of their drugs until personal outofpocket spending reached a level qualifying them for catastrophic coverage the medicare part d coverage gap discount program uses public and private funding to relieve the financial burden facing beneficiaries who fall into this coverage gap beginning in 2011 branded pharmaceutical companies paid 50 of the cost of the branded drugs in the gap and the government paid 7 of the cost of the generic drugs in the gap as a result rather than paying 100 of the total cost of their drugs when they reached the coverage gap enrollees paid 50 of the total cost of branded drugs and 93 of the total cost of generic drugs the contribution from the government for generic drugs grew to 14 in 2012 and will grow steadily over time until reaching 75 in 2020 in addition starting in 2013 the 50 discount from branded pharmaceutical companies was supplemented by a contribution from the government which will also grow steadily over time until reaching 25 in 2020 that means that by 2020 enrollees will pay only 25 of the cost of their branded and generic drugs in the gap 

biosimilars  the aca also created a framework for the approval of biosimilars also known as followon biologics following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation which will require the fda to address such key topics as the type and extent of data needed to establish biosimilarity the data required to achieve interchangeability compared to biosimilarity the naming convention for biosimilars the tracking and tracing of adverse events and the acceptability of data using a nonuslicensed comparator to demonstrate biosimilarity andor interchangeability with a uslicensed reference product the fda has begun to address some of these issues with the february 2012 release of three draft guidance documents specifically the fda has clarified that biosimilar applicants may use a nonuslicensed comparator in certain studies to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to a uslicensed reference product over the next several years the fda is expected to finalize the guidance documents released in 2012 and issue new draft guidance on clinical pharmacology for biosimilars 

medicaid and related matters  federal law requires branded pharmaceutical companies to provide rebates to state medicaid agencies the aca brought about major changes in the medicaid program collectively the measures i increased federal rebates paid by manufacturers on branded drugs within the traditional medicaid program from 151 to 231 and for generic drugs from 11 to 13 of average manufacturer price amp ii expanded medicaid drug rebates to cover drugs provided through managed medicaid plans and iii changed the rebate rates for line extensions or new formulations of solid oral dosage form drugs the law also created a federal upper limit under the medicaid program for generic drugs at 175 of amp in addition the law expanded the types of entities eligible for the “section 340b discounts” for outpatient drugs that began in 2010 postimplementation of the aca the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms withdrew its former detailed ampcalculation rules and in january 2014 a new rule regarding amp was released which revises requirements pertaining to medicaid reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs 

the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain medicines in medicaid restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states access in the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises a growing number of states are considering a variety of costcontrol strategies including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments 

pfizer must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview  section of the mda in our 2013 financial report and in the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 1g basis of presentation and significant accounting policies   revenues  in our 2013 financial report which are incorporated by reference 

pdufa reauthorization  the prescription drug user fee act pdufa was first enacted in 1992 to provide the fda with additional resources to speed the review of important new medicines prior to pdufa inadequate funding of the fda drug review process led to a backlog of application reviews and lengthy review times pdufa revolutionized the review process for new drugs and biologics without compromising high approval standards for demonstration of product safety quality and efficacy pdufa expires every five years and must be reauthorized by congress pdufa iv expired on september 30 2012 and was renewed as title i of the fda safety and innovation act fdasia in addition to pdufa v fdasia included a range of provisions important to the industry including new user fee requirements for biosimilar products and generics the pdufa v reauthorization reflected months of discussion between the fda industry and other stakeholders such as patient groups and consumers the current pdufa v agreement focuses on improving the efficiency and predictability of the review process strengthening the agency regulatory science base and enhancing benefitrisk assessment and postapproval safety surveillance 

budget control act of 2011  in august 2011 the federal budget control act of 2011 the budget control act was enacted in the us the budget control act includes provisions to raise the us treasury department’s borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling and provisions to reduce the federal deficit by 24 trillion between 2012 and 2021 deficitreduction targets included 900 billion of discretionary spending reductions associated with hhs and various agencies charged with national security but those discretionary spending reductions do not include programs such as medicare and medicaid or direct changes to pharmaceutical pricing rebates or discounts the office of management and budget omb was responsible for identifying the remaining 15 trillion of deficit reductions which were divided evenly between defense and nondefense spending under this omb review process social security medicaid veteran benefits and certain other spending categories were excluded from consideration but reductions in payments to medicare providers are allowed although these reductions are prohibited by law from exceeding a 2 reduction of the originally budgeted amount until 2021 additionally certain payments to medicare part d plans such as lowincome subsidy payments were exempt from reduction the budget control act spending reductions to date have not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in december 2013 congress enacted minor amendments to the budget control act providing for greater discretionary spending in 2014 and 2015 than originally budgeted the amendments also provide for fda user fee sequester relief for two years allowing the fda to continue to review new products the new legislation continues to prohibit reductions in payments to medicare providers from exceeding a 2 reduction of the originally budgeted amount and extends this prohibition for two years until 2023 the implications to pfizer of these changes are expected to be nominal however any significant spending reductions affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented andor any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us as part of any broader deficitreduction effort or legislative replacement for the budget control act could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

sustainable growth rate replacement  the medicare physician payment formula known as the sustainable growth rate sgr is routinely overridden by congressional action because it would lead to dramatic decreases in physician payment congress issued a bipartisan proposal to repeal the sgr and replace it with a new payment model the proposed feeforservice system would provide a modest annual payment rate increase until 2018 while allowing physicians and healthcare professionals to earn performancebased incentive payments after 2018 this form of sgr replacement is estimated by the congressional budget office to cost the federal government approximately 130 billion over 10 years the source of those funds has yet to be determined but could include additional taxes on andor rebate requirements applicable to the pharmaceutical industry including pfizer congress is considering a bill and is working to identify the means to pay for it prior to march 31 2014 when the current sgr will expire 

federal debt ceiling after the debt ceiling was reached on may 19 2013 and measures taken by the us treasury department to enable the us federal government to continue meeting its financial obligations were nearly exhausted congress enacted legislation on october 16 2013 that suspended the debt ceiling through february 7 2014 and preserved the ability of the us treasury department to use “extraordinary measures” to avoid a default on us federal government debt for a short period of time thereafter in february 2014 congress enacted legislation that further suspends the debt ceiling until march 15 2015 effectively ensuring the us federal government’s ability to satisfy its financial obligations in until that date including under medicare medicaid and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that have a direct impact on our results of operations 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries 

pricing and reimbursement  in europe japan china canada and south korea and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states so we continue to work with individual countries on such matters across the region 

the world economy in 2013 faced ongoing challenges and in particular continuing uncertainty around the solvency of governments as a result global growth has remained low with many eu countries experiencing a recession in recent years one of the consequences of the economic challenges for almost all world economies has been an increase in public debt as a proportion of gross domestic product arising from increased government spending and reduced tax receipts for many developed economies particularly in europe this has exacerbated existing fiscal imbalances and has created doubt in investment markets about the sustainability of public debt levels in a number of european countries further raising the cost of borrowing with the result that financial support has been necessary from the eu to greece portugal ireland and spain and from the international monetary fund in the cases of greece portugal ireland and cyprus ireland ceased receiving eu financial support in december 2013 and spain ceased receiving eu financial support in january 2014 stringent austerity measures have been implemented in many european countries with the aim of closing the fiscal gap in particular in spain italy and greece while the second half of 2013 saw a return to slow economic growth in many western european countries and the eu as a whole significant pressure on public spending is likely to continue for the foreseeable future as many countries seek to reduce their outstanding public debt central and eastern europe particularly countries such as romania hungary and slovenia are also experiencing pressures on public spending 

under these macroeconomic conditions pfizer continues to face widespread downward pressures on international pricing and reimbursement particularly in developed european markets japan and in certain emerging markets all of which have a large government share of pharmaceutical spending and are facing a difficult fiscal environment specific pricing pressures in 2013 included measures to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditures in japan france italy spain greece belgium ireland and portugal 

the practice of eu member states linking their regulated medicine prices to those of other countries ie international reference pricing irp adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation price variations have also resulted from exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and other european currencies which are exacerbated by irp systems the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to irp policies emergency measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries and ongoing exchange rate fluctuations 

in several latin american markets pfizer continues to face revenue pressures due to government policies aimed at health cost containment including price controls venezuela irp colombia and pricing reforms brazil and argentina 

in canada introductory “nonexcessive” prices and price increases are controlled by the federal patented medicines prices review board however reimbursement is under provincial jurisdiction as provinces continue to face budget pressure from growing healthcare expenditures many provincial governments have developed pricing and purchasing strategies including product listing agreements and a pancanadian pricing alliance initiative to obtain lower drug prices the private sector is also attempting to exert its negotiating power on drug manufacturers 

in south korea the national health insurance deficit prompted the government to make significant price cuts in the offpatent sector effective april 2012 in september 2013 the government revised its pricing policy again to introduce risk sharing schemes we continue to work with a committee established by the government to improve the pricing system for innovative new drugs 

turkey references prices to several european markets at a fixed exchange rate between the euro and the turkish lira though actual exchange rates have since diverged significantly from that fixed rate the turkish government has to date not adjusted the exchange rate which negatively impacts our financial results in turkey 

european union 

new drug approval  the approval of new drugs across the eu may be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissionema centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the european economic area countries norway and iceland the use of these procedures generally 

provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

eu regulation on medicines for pediatric use  in january 2007 the eu regulation on medicines for pediatric use became effective this introduced obligations on pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on their medicines for children and subject to various conditions offered the possibility of incentives for so doing including exclusivity extensions a pediatric committee was created within the ema to provide scientific opinions and input on development plans for medicines for use with children in accordance with this regulation pfizer has completed and is conducting pediatric research programs for its inline and development products and has successfully obtained the exclusivity extension incentive for a number of products 

pharmacovigilance legislation  in july 2012 new pharmacovigilance legislation came into force in the eu which included new and revised requirements that impact pfizer’s global safety system key changes include the establishment of a new pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee within the ema with responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the eu authorities it also introduces the possibility for regulators in the eu to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization efficacy studies at the time of approval or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products the new legislation also introduces significantly increased transparency into the safety review process 

falsified medicines directive  in 2013 the falsified medicines directive came into force portions of which have become effective and the remaining portions of which will become effective at various times the directive is aimed at preventing falsified medicines from entering into the eu’s legal supply chain notably the directive imposes new obligations on all parties in the distribution chain including importers traders manufacturers distributors and any operator who repackages a product with key safety features expected to be in place by 2017 

draft clinical trials regulation at the end of 2013 the text of a new eu regulation on clinical trials was agreed to in principle and is expected to become law in 2014 and to be implemented in 2016 the new regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the eu particularly the processes for submission and approval of clinical trial applications which have been criticized as harming europe’s competitiveness in clinical rd of new medicines in line with the protransparency policy of the eu institutions the new regulation will also require public posting of clinical trial results to a significantly greater extent than before 

clinical trial data sharing transparency in the pharmaceutical area is a key theme and priority for the european commission and the ema particularly with regard to clinical trial results and data submitted for marketing authorization in the eu recently the ema has disclosed significantly more of such data upon request than in previous years in june 2013 the ema issued a draft policy on the publication and access to clinical trial data for public consultation which proposes to publish certain clinical trial data including clinical study reports on its website this new policy was originally intended to be effective on january 1 2014 and apply to marketing authorization applications and variation applications submitted to the ema after march 2014 however due to the large number of comments received the ema has postponed the effective date and is currently reviewing the draft policy in july 2013 the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations efpia and phrma introduced their principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing our commitment to patients and researchers  as an alternative to the ema’s proposed rules under these principles efpia and phrma member companies have committed to enhancing public health through responsible sharing of clinical data pfizer publicly released its updated clinical trial data sharing policy in december 2013 which meets or exceeds all aspects of these commitments   

corporate responsibility in the eu pharmaceutical sector  in 2010 the commissioner for industry and entrepreneurship of the european commission launched a process on corporate responsibility in the pharmaceutical industry the process which concluded in october 2013 included three independent platforms i transparency and ethics in the sector ii access to medicines in africa and iii access to medicines in europe in the context of pricing and reimbursement while all platforms have produced reports concrete recommendations appear vague the european commission is currently evaluating how to build on these results and is considering a new industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector likely to be launched in the second half of 2014 

transfers of value disclosures 2013  in july 2013 efpia released its disclosure code of transfers of value to healthcare professionals and organizations the code requires all members of efpia including pfizer to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations beginning in 2016 covering the relevant transfers in 2015 each member 

company will be required to document and disclose i the names of healthcare professionals and associations that have received payments or other transfers of value and ii the amounts or value transferred and the type of relationship 

canada 

health canada hc is the government agency that provides regulatory and marketing approval for drugs and therapeutic products in canada in 2012 as part of the legislative regulatory modernization lrm hc released the regulatory roadmap for health products and food a fiveyear plan and in 2013 a new patient safety legislation that is expected to give hc more authority equivalent to the fda and ema was introduced to parliament the goals of the new framework are i to protect   against the sale and advertising of unsafe food and health products ii to implement a sciencebased regulatory system in which benefits harms and uncertainties associated with health products are made transparent to the public and iii to ensure that the regulatory system is efficient sustainable and responsive to the evolution of science patient and consumer behavior as well as practices in healthcare  the future regulatory system is expected to be more consumer and patientcentered and focused on evidence 2014 priorities include orphan drug regulations plain language labeling and use of foreign regulatory information 

the 2004 federal provincial territorial fpt health accord that sets out the canada health transfers payment a budgetary mechanism that provides for funding to provincial governments by the federal government plus commitments on health policy initiatives expires on march 31 2014 in advance of the 2014 expiration of the fpt health accord the federal government announced in december 2011 a new funding framework that provides for funding growth of 6 annually through 20162017 and growth each year thereafter through 2024 equal to the increase in the nominal gross domestic product with a floor set at 3 while this new formula results in financial predictability through 2024 many provinces may face a funding shortfall that could potentially result in among other things budget reductions for drug reimbursement andor additional cost containment measures 

asia 

the regulatory environment in asia presents multiple challenges for companies trying to achieve simultaneous global development and registration ie marketing products at the same time as in the us europe canada and elsewhere while each country in asia has its unique regulatory concerns there are a number of regulatory issues that are common among the majority of countries in asia for example with the exception of japan health authorities in asia generally require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority eg the fda before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval proof of reference country approval is usually satisfied by submitting a certificate of pharmaceutical product a legal document that is issued by the competent health authority certifying that the company’s product has satisfied its country’s registration requirements and manufacturing standards often this requirement delays marketing authorization in asia by 1215 months following marketing authorization in the us and europe 

another common regulatory issue in asia is the requirement for local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval each of japan china south korea taiwan india and vietnam has regulations that in some form require clinical studies in the country eg china requires a prescribed number of chinese patients regardless of the product therapeutic area or disease population although some agencies have shown flexibility based on scientific rationale related to ethnicity assessments it is not uncommon for companies to be required to duplicate costly clinical trials in asia pursuant to these regulations this can further add to marketing approval delays compared to the us and europe additionally similar requirements for local clinical data exist outside of asia in countries such as mexico and russia where we try to ensure their inclusion in global clinical studies where feasible or conduct additional studies there which further delays marketing authorization in those countries 

in japan the government has taken measures to reduce the drug lag ie historically drugs were often launched in japan years after the eu and us markets by utilizing a twopronged approach i reducing regulatory agency review times and ii establishing a new pilot pricing premium the pilot pricing premium provides a financial incentive for drug development in japan while economic conditions and government debt levels continue to put pressure on healthcare costs resulting in cost containment particularly in the offpatent sector the extension of the pilot pricing premium until december 2015 for innovative products is encouraging 

the controlling regulatory agency in china is the china food and drug administration cfda cfda’s scope of responsibilities is similar to that of the fda and ema two key agencies within cfda are the center for drug evaluation cde and the national institutes for food and drug control nifdc the cde which is analogous to the fda’s center for drug evaluation and research is primarily responsible for the technical review of product applications including clinical trial applications and new drug applications and drafting technical guidance documents nifdc is the quality testing arm of cfda responsible for the testing of pharmaceuticals biologics and medical devices nationwide 

china’s regulatory system is unique in many ways and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with international standards as a result it is not uncommon to see treatments entering the market in china two to five years after first marketing in the us and europe there are three main contributing factors to this delay i clinical trial authorization approval times that are five to 10 times longer than international standards and add greater than 12 months to development time ii significant local chinese patient number requirements for biologic products regardless of product characteristics or disease prevalence and iii with respect to imported vaccines a reference country approval is required in order to start clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 

additionally in 2013 the pharmaceutical industry including pfizer experienced regulatory challenges in china all of which contributed to delays in market access andor further resource expenditures including i stricter chinese quality standards compared to fda and eu quality standards ii increased cde product registration application backlogs eg the cde initiated its review of a pfizer product registration application 12 months after submission and iii postmarketing clinical studies 

in india the federal regulatory authority the central drugs standard control organization cdsco led by the drugs controller general india is responsible for regulation of biopharmaceuticals including clinical trial authorization in 2013 based on its evaluation of the cdsco the indian government implemented legislative changes that impacted the conduct and regulatory oversight of clinical trials which make it more difficult for the pharmaceutical industry including pfizer to conduct clinical research in india for example during the first half of 2013 the supreme court of india banned all clinical trials for new chemical entities unless approved by the ministry of health additionally approval times for product registration have increased in india compared to previous years primarily due to internal framework changes within cdsco 

intellectual property   

while the global intellectual property environment has improved following wtotrips and bilateralmultilateral trade agreements our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection see patents and other intellectual property rights above in emerging market countries in particular governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines as well as to protect their national pharmaceutical industries there is considerable political pressure to weaken existing intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions eg new medical treatment methods revocation of patents issuance of compulsory licenses weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries 

in december 2012 the eu approved an eu patent package which was agreed to by 25 out of 27 eu member states excluding italy and spain which opted out but which are free to opt back in this will create a unitary eu patent ie a uniform patent with equal effect that will be granted transferred and enforced in a unitary way through participating member states patent grants will continue to be granted through the existing european patent office but a new court system will be set up to enforce such patents and hear revocation actions the central division of the new court will be in paris although a section based in london will hear chemical and pharmaceutical cases the new regime reduces the translation requirement should allow patentees to obtain paneuropean injunctions and damages and should reduce forumshopping in europe for patent holders seeking to enforce their patents as well as generic manufacturers alleging patent invalidity or noninfringement the eu patent package will enter into force after 13 european countries have ratified it 

canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity but is generally perceived to be less predictable than the intellectual property regimes of comparable countries through intense negotiations as part of the canadaeu comprehensive economic  trade agreement ceta the canadian intellectual property regime looks to potentially be further enhanced by eu demands to align their respective intellectual property regimes canada recently joined the ongoing negotiations of the transpacific trade partnership tpp and it is expected that the tpp negotiations will further pressure canada to enhance its intellectual property regime 

in china the intellectual property environment has improved although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with world trade organization wto provisions and several companies including pfizer have established rd centers in china due to increased confidence in china’s intellectual property environment despite this china remained on the us department of commerce priority watch list for 2013 further the standards for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in 

other major markets including the us europe and japan also while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent for example the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage 

in brazil and other latin american countries the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents eg anvisa in brazil restrictive patentability rules and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions such as new medical uses of drug products may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products 

in india policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents the increasing tendency of the indian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to protect many of our inventions india maintains a system of pregrant patent oppositions that delays the granting of patents and adds an additional challenge in our ability to protect our products through patents indian law includes special restrictions on the types of pharmaceutical inventions that may be patented which may limit our ability to protect our products recent use by the indian government of compulsory licensing and patent revocation mechanisms heightens the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population such as infectious diseases cancer and diabetes in september 2012 pfizer’s patent covering sutent was revoked by the indian patent office and other challenges against pfizer patents are ongoing 

in south korea the laws and regulations for the patentregulatory approval linkage system were finalized and are in the process of being implemented as part of the united stateskorea free trade agreement in 2012 the korean patentregulatory approval linkage system includes biologics 

environmental matters 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 17 commitments and contingencies  in our 2013 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2013 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we have no reason to believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

climate change presents risks to our operations including potential physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to more frequent and severe weather events and water availability we cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future however we have reviewed the potential for these risks and have concluded that because of our facility locations our existing distribution networks and our controls we do not believe these risks are material to pfizer in the near term 

tax matters

employees 

in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 77700 people in our operations throughout the world 

disclosure pursuant to section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra requires disclosure by public companies of certain transactions involving the government of iran as well as entities and individuals designated under executive order 13382 and executive order 13224 the executive orders in some instances itrshra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they were permissible under us law or were conducted by a nonus affiliate in accordance with the local law under which such entity operates 

as a global biopharmaceutical company we conduct business in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world during 2013 our activities included supplying lifesaving medicines and medical products pfizer products for patient and consumer use in iran and syria we ship pfizer products to iran and syria and conduct related activities in accordance with licenses issued by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and other us and nonus governmental entities and in line with our corporate policies we will continue our global activities to improve the health and wellbeing of patients and consumers in a manner consistent with applicable laws and our corporate policies 

to our knowledge none of our activities during 2013 is required to be disclosed pursuant to itrshra with the following possible exceptions pursuant to us government authorizations pfizer through a nonus subsidiary shipped pfizer products to authorized customers in iran in 2013 some of these shipments which were arranged and effectuated by a thirdparty logistics company were sent to iran on aircraft owned or operated by iran air or aban air these air carriers are designated under the executive orders pfizer neither entered into agreements with these designated air carriers nor made any direct payments to these carriers pfizer paid air freight expenses associated with these shipments to the thirdparty logistics company in the amount of approximately euro 43716 we have voluntarily selfdisclosed this matter to the us government we have instructed our thirdparty logistics companies not to use air carriers designated under the executive orders to ship pfizer products in the future and we are implementing additional controls to address this issue

us healthcare reformhealthcare legislation 

as mentioned above in item 1 business under the caption government regulation and price constraints—in the united states  the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and its provisions become effective on various dates with the medicaid and health insurance exchange coverage expansion effective in 2014 we expect that the rebates discounts taxes and other costs resulting from the aca over time will have a significant effect on our expenses and profitability in the future see the discussion under the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — regulatory environmentpricing and access — us healthcare legislation  section of the mda in our 2013 financial report and in item 1 business  under the caption government regulation and price constraints—in the united states  furthermore if asked to act in 2016 or beyond the ipab created by the aca to reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending could potentially limit access to certain treatments or mandate price controls for our products moreover expanded government investigative authority may increase the costs of compliance with new regulations and programs we also face the uncertainties that might result from any modification repeal or invalidation of any of the provisions of the aca 

us deficitreduction actions 

as discussed above in item 1 business under the caption government regulation and price constraints — budget control act of 2011  the budget control act spending reductions to date have not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations however any significant spending reductions affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented andor any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us as part of any broader deficitreduction effort or legislative replacement to the budget control act or to reform the sustainable growth rate could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

pricing pressures and government regulation 

us and international governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies 

in the us many of our biopharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures have increased as a result of the 2003 medicare modernization act 2003 mma and the aca due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of beneficiaries in addition if the 2003 mma or the aca were amended to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions it would have a significant adverse impact on our business furthermore mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including among others changes in patent laws the importation of drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by governments of foreign countries restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe japan china canada and south korea and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for governmentsponsored healthcare systems in particular there were governmentmandated price reductions for certain biopharmaceutical products in japan and certain european and emerging market countries in 2013 and we anticipate continuing pricing pressures in japan europe and emerging markets in 2014 this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions failure to obtain timely or adequate governmentapproved pricing or formulary placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccines business we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business 

managed care trends 

consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private insurers private thirdparty insurers as well as governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue in addition to formulary tier copay differentials private health insurance companies and selfinsured employers have been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products this cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medication choices as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us payer market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time which can adversely affect our business as discussed above a number of our current products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years 

also the patents covering several of our medicines including viagra  celebrex  lyrica  sutent  epipen  pristiq  toviaz  tygacil  and embeda extendedrelease capsules in the us and lipitor  in china are being challenged by generic manufacturers in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products which can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence products that compete with ours including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

dependence on key inline products 

we recorded direct product revenues of more than 1 billion for each of 10 biopharmaceutical products in 2013 lyrica  the prevnar  family of products enbrel  celebrex  lipitor  viagra  zyvox  norvasc  sutent  and the premarin  family of products those products accounted for 51 of our total biopharmaceutical revenues in 2013 if these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant as noted above in item 1 business  under the caption patents and other intellectual property rights  patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years including some of our billiondollar and previously billiondollar products and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products 

further our alliance revenues have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and copromotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time for example our rights to aricept  in japan returned to eisai in december 2012 our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim for spiriva  expires on a countrybycountry basis between 2012 and 2016 including the expiration in certain eu markets canada and australia in early 2013 and in the us and certain other eu markets in early 2014 our us and canada copromotion agreement with amgen inc amgen for enbrel  expired on october 31 2013 our exclusive rights to enbrel outside the us and canada are not affected by the expiration of the copromotion agreement with amgen and our collaboration agreement with emd serono inc to copromote rebif in the us will expire at the end of 2015 see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions and overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook—our operating environment — intellectual property rights and collaborationlicensing rights sections of the mda in our 2013 financial report for additional information on the expirations of these agreements 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products and the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity as well as to provide for earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers either through internal rd or through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties however balancing current growth investment for the future and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new 

product introductions and in rd for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

additionally our rd investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipeline could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the science may not work for any given program despite the significant investment required for rd

the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process including as the result of unfavorable clinical trial results there can be no assurance regarding our ability to meet anticipated clinical trial commencement and completion dates regulatory submission dates and launch dates for product candidates or as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products and there is no assurance that any of our late stage pipeline products will receive regulatory approval andor be commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets andor be commercially successful there is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings should they occur 

there are many considerations that can affect the marketing of our products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete or adequately design and implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that can adversely affect the realization of rd and productrelated forwardlooking statements further claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in a negative impact on product sales product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims also increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the riskbenefit profile of products as they relate to alreadyapproved products has resulted in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for among other things additional clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies see postapproval data  below 

in addition failure to put in place adequate controls andor resources for effective collection reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance see postapproval data  below in compliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety regulatory actions and risks to product sales 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase iv trials could result in loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 the fdaaa gave the fda enhanced postmarket authority including the explicit authority to require postmarket studies and clinical trials labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with fdaapproved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies the fda’s exercise of its authority under the fdaaa has in some cases resulted and in the future could result in delays or increased costs during product development clinical trials and regulatory review increased costs to comply with additional postapproval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products nonus regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable costs for example a postmarketing study as part of a postapproval commitment to marketing authorization is becoming more 

common in china where the cfda requires additional clinical data in the chinese population in order to further assess the safety and efficacy of a product sometimes independent of the level of global clinical data available postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect sales of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate or are perceived to implicate an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of the affected products accordingly new data about our products or products similar to our products could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in updated labeling restrictions on use product withdrawal or recall furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of our products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of our products 

patent protection 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our products using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinctive  patent laws we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including among others claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term 

our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as a result of local political pressure or in the case of national emergencies in addition mechanisms exist in much of the world permitting some form of challenge by competitors or generic drug marketers to our patents prior to or immediately following the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights   further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third party objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

biotechnology products 

as discussed above in item 1 business  under the captions patents and other intellectual property  and government regulation and price constraints — biosimilars  abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may 

become subject to competition from biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow the expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired we may face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue 

we are developing biosimilar medicines the developing pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products in the us could diminish the value of our past and future investments in biosimilars other risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products there is also a risk of lower prescriptions of biosimilars due to potential concerns over comparability with innovator medicines 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities once the drug receives approval for example more detailed studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process but each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit and the potential delays to approval of the primary indication we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably foresee and address challenges but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between speed trial conduct and desired outcome will be achieved each time the degree to which these challenges are foreseen and addressed could affect our future results 

foreign exchange and interest rate risk 

significant portions of our revenues and earnings as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 61  of our total 2013 revenues were derived from international operations including 26 from the europe region and 21 from japan and the rest of asia region as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the uk pound the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses if the us dollar were to weaken against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would increase having a positive impact on earnings and our overall expenses would increase having a negative impact on earnings conversely if the us dollar were to strengthen against another currency assuming all other variables remained constant our revenues would decrease having a negative impact on earnings and our overall expenses would decrease having a positive impact on earnings therefore significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results and financial guidance for example on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 43 to 63 of venezuelan currency to the us dollar we have experienced and will continue to experience ongoing adverse impacts to earnings as our revenues and expenses will be translated into us dollars at a lower rate we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the venezuelan currency or devaluations of any other currencies 

in addition our interestbearing investments and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section of the mda in our 2013 financial report for additional details see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 7e financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2013 financial report those sections of our 2013 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of developed markets leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s global performance as a result we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets including the full integration of emerging markets into each of our three new businesses — the global innovative pharmaceutical business  the global vaccines oncology and consumer healthcare business  and the global established pharmaceutical business  however there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that these countries will continue to sustain these growth rates in addition some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending which as discussed above can adversely affect our results 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products has generated payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector while the impact on us of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has been limited to date our growing portfolio of specialty products combined with the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world and the deteriorating finances of certain governments may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future 

consumer healthcare 

the consumer healthcare business may be impacted by economic volatility the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal reformulation andor relabeling of certain products eg coughcold products see global economic conditions  below 

global economic conditions 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the us europe and japan and in a number of emerging markets we believe that patients experiencing the effects of the challenging economic environment including high unemployment levels and increases in copays sometimes switch to generic products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments to reduce their costs challenging economic conditions in the us also have increased the number of patients in the medicaid program and the number will continue to grow as a result of the medicaid coverage expansion effective in some states in 2014 in accordance with the aca under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and in many states to formulary restrictions limiting access to brandname drugs including ours in addition we continue to experience pricing pressure in various markets around the world including in developed european markets japan and in a number of emerging markets with governmentmandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products and governmentimposed access restrictions in certain countries furthermore some government agencies and thirdparty payers use health technology assessments in ways that at times lead to lower prices for and restricted access to new medicines 

the challenging global economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate it will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources due to our significant operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as market conditions change we continue to monitor our liquidity position however there can be no assurance that possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources or impact our ability to obtain financing in the future 

other potential impacts of these challenging economic conditions include declining sales increased costs changes in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of or a lower rate of return on our financial assets and pension plan investments which may require us to increase our pension funding obligations adverse government actions delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

outsourcing 

we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial execution nonclinical research safety services and other areas in 2013 we continued to place the majority of our clinical trial execution services with two strategic clinical research organizations cros and we also utilized another cro to execute early phase development studies service performance issues with these cros may adversely impact the progression of our clinical trial programs outsourcing of services to third parties could also expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery which may result in missed deadlines supply disruptions noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our results 

we continue to pursue a multiyear initiative to outsource some transactionprocessing activities within certain accounting processes and are migrating to a consistent enterprise resource planning system across the organization these are enhancements of ongoing activities to support the growth of our financial shared service capabilities and standardize our financial systems if any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of the new system were to occur they could adversely affect our operations including among other ways through a failure to meet demand for our products or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations 

interactions with healthcare professionals and government officials 

risks and uncertainties apply where we provide something of value to a healthcare professional andor government official which if found to be improper could potentially result in government enforcement actions and penalties these risks may increase as nonus jurisdictions adopt new antibribery laws and regulations 

difficulties of our wholesale distributors 

in 2013 our largest wholesale distributor accounted for approximately 12 of our total revenue and 30 of our total us revenue and our top three wholesale distributors accounted for approximately 29 of our total revenue and 73 of our total us revenue if one of our significant wholesale distributors should encounter financial or other difficulties such distributor might decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we might be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions shutdowns approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions or shortages reputational harm product liability unanticipated costs or otherwise examples of such difficulties or delays include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network andor comply with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulations such as serialization which allows for track and trace of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety risks to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or manmade disasters at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor including those that may be related to climate change or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration product diversion product theft and counterfeit goods 

counterfeit products 

a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicines can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual patients the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of underregulated wholesalers and repackagers the importation of medicines across borders and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters further laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only 

minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured — often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact our business by among other things causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation 

we undertake significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines including among other things working with the fda and other regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicines implementing business practices designed to protect patient health promoting public policies intended to hinder counterfeiting and working collaboratively with wholesalers pharmacies customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and repackagers no assurance can be given however that our efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase 

cost and expense controlunusual eventsfailure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitionsintangible assets and goodwill 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings internal reorganizations product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of i our costreduction and productivity initiatives including those related to our rd organization ii our internal separation of our commercial operations into three new global businesses iii any other corporate strategic initiatives we may pursue in the future and iv any acquisitions divestitures or other initiatives we may pursue in the future 

in addition our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets will ultimately yield successful products the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future for goodwill all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity any such charges may be significant 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including among others changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including tax rate changes new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals competition laws privacy laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities antitrust environmental employment and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive 

verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid drug rebate program the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this 2013 form 10k as well as antikickback and false claims laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions like many companies in our industry we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as by consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries for example these claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

in connection with the resolution of certain us government investigations concerning various products in september 2009 we entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services which is effective through december 31 2014 in connection with the resolution of our fcpa matters in august 2012 one of our subsidiaries entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the us department of justice which has a term of approximately two years in the cia and dpa we agreed to implement andor maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program and fda requirements and antibribery and anticorruption and other applicable laws a material failure to comply with the cia or dpa could result in severe sanctions against us 

patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through acquisitions licensing and alliances see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our business development initiatives  section of the mda in our 2013 financial report which is incorporated by reference however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions 

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including but not limited to personal information and intellectual property and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems and those of our thirdparty vendors with whom we contract and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal groups “hacktivists” nation states and others while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach in our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result 

in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us 

environmental claims and proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims and proceedings amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accruals for contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations

operating segments 

we manage our operations through five operating segments — primary care specialty care and oncology established products and emerging markets animal health and consumer healthcare as of the third quarter of 2012 the animal health and consumer healthcare business units are no longer managed as a single operating segment each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain research and development activities related to inline products and inprocess research and development iprd projects that generally have achieved proofofconcept 

we regularly review our segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources generally products are transferred to the established products business unit in the beginning of the fiscal year following loss of patent protection or marketing exclusivity 

a description of each of our five operating segments follows

genitourinary major depressive disorder pain respiratory and smoking cessation examples of products in this segment in 2012 include celebrex  chantixchampix  eliquis  lipitor  in certain european union eu countries and in australia and new zealand lyrica  premarin  pristiq  and viagra  all revenues for these products are allocated to the primary care business unit except those generated in emerging markets and those that are managed by the established products business unit 

beginning in 2012 sales of lipitor  in the us canada south korea and japan were reported in our established products business unit and beginning in 2013 sales of lipitor in australia and most of developed europe are being reported in our established products business unit

table captioned revenues by segment and geographic area  in the mda in our 2012 financial report which are incorporated by reference 

our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate in the us the principal authority regulating our operations is the us food and drug administration fda the fda regulates the safety and efficacy of the products we offer and our research quality manufacturing processes product promotion advertising and product labeling similar regulations exist in most other countries and in many countries the government also regulates our prices see government regulation and price constraints  below 

biopharmaceutical products 

our biopharmaceutical business is comprised of the following five business units primary care specialty care oncology established products and emerging markets for further information regarding these business units see operating segments  above and for a discussion of certain of our key biopharmaceutical products including lyrica  lipitor  enbrel  prevnar 13prevenar 13  celebrex  viagra  norvasc  zyvox  sutent  and the premarin  family see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions  section of the mda in our 2012 financial report 

revenues from biopharmaceutical products contributed approximately 87 of our total revenues in 2012 88 of our total revenues in 2011 and 90 of our total revenues in 2010 

we recorded direct product sales of more than 1 billion for each of 10 biopharmaceutical products in 2012 each of 12 biopharmaceutical products in 2011 and each of 15 biopharmaceutical products in 2010 these products represented 49 of our revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2012 56 of our revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2011 and 60 of our revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2010 see item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products  below 

worldwide revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2012 were 512 billion a decrease of 11 compared to 2011 primarily due to the decrease of 76 billion in operational revenues from lipitor  geodon  xalatan  caduet  aromasin and detrol  and lower alliance revenues for aricept  all due to the loss of exclusivity in certain markets and from lower alliance revenues for spiriva  due to the finalyear terms of our collaboration agreements in certain european countries canada and australia lower revenues for effexor  and zosyntazocin  and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 13 billion or 2 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in operational revenues in developed markets for certain biopharmaceutical products particularly lyrica  celebrex  and enbrel  and in revenues from emerging markets 

geographically in the us revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 17 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflecting lower revenues from lipitor  geodon  caduet  xalatan and aromasin  all due to the loss of exclusivity lower alliance revenues due to loss of exclusivity of aricept  5mg and 10mg tablets in november 2010 and lower revenues from effexor  zosyn  and detroldetrol la  the impact of these adverse factors was partially offset by the strong performance of certain other biopharmaceutical products lower reductions related to rebates and the lower reduction in revenues related to the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act commonly referred to as the affordable care act or aca 

for additional information regarding the impact of the aca on our revenues see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — us healthcare legislation  section of the mda in our 2012 financial report 

in our international markets revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 7 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of lipitor  in most of developed europe and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3 operationally revenues decreased 4 in 2012 compared to 2011 in addition to lipitor  the decrease in operational revenues was driven by xalatanxalacom  aricept  and aromasin  all due to the loss of exclusivity in certain markets as well as lower alliance revenues primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of aricept  in many major european markets and lower revenues for spiriva  in certain european countries canada and australia reflecting the finalyear terms of our spiriva collaboration agreements relating to those countries as well as lower revenues for norvasc  and effexor  the impact of these adverse factors was partially offset by the strong operational growth of lyrica  prevnar 13prevenar 13  and enbrel  

during 2012 international revenues from biopharmaceutical products represented 62 of total revenues from biopharmaceutical products compared to 59 in 2011

other products 

animal health 

our animal health operating segment is a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which it operates it discovers develops manufactures and commercializes animal health medicines and vaccines with a focus on both livestock and companion animals 

on february 6 2013 an ipo of our subsidiary zoetis was completed pursuant to which we sold 99015 million shares of zoetis in exchange for the retirement of approximately 25 billion of pfizer commercial paper issued on january 10 2013 the ipo represented approximately 198 of the total outstanding zoetis shares on february 1 2013 zoetis shares began trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “zts” prior to and in connection with the ipo zoetis completed a 365 billion senior notes offering and we transferred to zoetis substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our animal health business for additional details see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 19a subsequent events zoetis debt offering and initial public offering  in our 2012 financial report 

we will continue to consolidate zoetis as we have retained control over the entity and we will reflect amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests for the divested portion the net assets operations and cash flows that comprise zoetis are not the same as those of the animal health operating segment 

revenues from animal health products were approximately 43 billion in 2012 an increase of 3 compared to 2011 reflecting higher operational revenues of 6 partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3 operational revenues from animal health products were favorably impacted by the solid performance in both the livestock and companion animal portfolios 

major categories and product lines in the animal health business include 

 

consumer healthcare 

based on 2012 revenues our consumer healthcare operating segment is the fifthlargest branded multinational overthecounter otc healthcare products business in the world and sells two of the ten largest selling otc healthcare brands  centrum  and advil  in the world consumer healthcare revenues totaled 32 billion for 2012 an increase of 6 compared to 2011 reflecting higher operational revenues of 8 partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2 the operational revenue increase was primarily due to the addition of products from the acquisitions of the consumer healthcare business of ferrosan holding as ferrosan in december 2011 and alacer corp alacer in february 2012 discussed below the consumer healthcare operating segment holds strong positions in various geographic markets with its highest revenue volume in the us canada china germany italy brazil and australia 

major categories and product lines in our consumer healthcare business include

nutrition 

on november 30 2012 we completed the sale of our nutrition business to nestlé for 1185 billion in cash pfizer nutrition was a business that sold infant nutritionals including infant milk formula brands for newborns and toddlers in certain markets outside the us and canada for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 2b acquisitions divestitures collaborative arrangements and equitymethod investments divestitures  in our 2012 financial report   

research and development 

innovation by our research and development rd operations is very important to our success as a result and also because we are predominantly a human health company the vast majority of our research and development spending is associated with human health products compounds and activities our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs we spent 79 billion in 2012 91 billion in 2011 and 95 billion in 2010 on research and development 

biopharmaceutical rd 

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines through collaborations alliance and license agreements acquisitions and other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable according to the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma out of 500010000 screened compounds only 250 enter preclinical testing five enter human clinical trials and one is approved by the fda the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than 10 years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

as of yearend 2012 we had 276 projects in research and development ranging from discovery through registration of which 78 programs are in phase 1 through registration with the remainder of the projects in preclinical development at yearend 2012 our phase 3 portfolio contained 17 programs development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple different programs while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses or indications for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — product developments — biopharmaceutical  section of the mda in our 2012 financial report which is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence see item 1a risk factors — competitive products  below 

we continue to closely evaluate our global research and development function and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in rd by prioritizing areas that we believe have the greatest scientific and commercial promise utilizing appropriate riskreturn profiles and focusing on areas that we believe have the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time to that end our research primarily focuses on five highpriority areas that have a mix of small and large molecules — immunology and inflammation oncology cardiovascular and metabolic diseases neuroscience and pain and vaccines in addition to reducing the number of disease areas of focus we have realigned and reduced our research and development footprint and outsourced certain functions that do not drive competitive advantage for pfizer for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our strategy  section of the mda in our 2012 financial report 

for additional information regarding our rd operations see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — research and development section of the mda in our 2012 financial report 

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states for the developed markets these operations for human pharmaceutical products are managed through the same business units as our us operations ie primary care specialty care oncology and established products our operations in emerging markets for human pharmaceutical products are managed through the emerging markets business unit within the established products and emerging markets segment our animal health and consumer healthcare operating segments manage their operations worldwide 

revenues from operations outside the us of 359 billion accounted for 61 of our total revenues in 2012 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 16 countries outside the us in 2012 and 2011 and in each of 17 countries outside the us in 2010 the us is our largest national market comprising 39 of total revenues in 2012 41 of total revenues in 2011 and 44 of total revenues in 2010 japan is our secondlargest national market with 10 of total revenues in 2012 9 of total revenues in 2011 and 8 of total revenues in 2010 

for a geographic breakdown of revenues see the table captioned geographic information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  in our 2012 financial report and the table captioned revenues by segment and geographic area  in the mda in our 2012 financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include among other things currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions see item 1a risk factors — risks affecting international operations  below our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws and regulations on pricing reimbursement and access to our products see government regulation and price constraints  below for a discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2012 both revenues and net income were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange in general as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar decreased our revenues and net income in many countries while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments depending upon market conditions for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 7e financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2012 financial report as well as the 

forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section of the mda in our 2012 financial report those sections of our 2012 financial report are incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical businesses we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos employers and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

our biopharmaceutical businesses include five human health customerfocused business units primary care specialty care including vaccines oncology established products and emerging markets we operate in customerfocused business units within our biopharmaceutical businesses to better meet the diverse needs of physicians patients and our customers while seeking to maximize value for our company and our shareholders 

our us primary care operations are structured into regional units in order to create a more flexible organization to identify and address local market dynamics and customer needs our structure is designed to align the sales marketing and medical functions to work closely to meet the needs of key customer groups while seeking to ensure common coordination focus and accountability across the organizations 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies and in the case of prevnar 13  directly to individual provider offices in the us we seek to gain access to healthcare authority pbm and mco formularies formularies are lists of approved medicines available to members that are tiered according to copay amounts and reimbursed by the respective pbm or mco we also work with mcos pbms employers and other healthcare providers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

during 2012 pfizer revenues from our three largest biopharmaceutical wholesalers were as follows 

 

sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the biopharmaceutical businesses in addition our consumer healthcare operating segment generates a significant portion of its sales from several large customers the loss of any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the consumer healthcare operating segment 

each of our global animal health and consumer healthcare operating segments utilizes its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products and each occasionally uses distributors in smaller markets 

our animal health operating segment’s advertising and promotions are generally targeted to veterinary healthcare professionals livestock producers and pet owners animal health products are sold directly to veterinarians and livestock producers as well as through distributors and retail outlets 

our consumer healthcare operating segment’s advertising and promotions are generally disseminated to consumers through television print digital and other media advertising as well as through instore promotion consumer healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies retail chains and grocery and convenience stores 

patents and intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country further patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period andor the granted patent term extension are those for the drugs set forth in the table below the basic patents for these products in other large markets may expire in the same earlier or later years 

  



1 with respect to the products in this table the corresponding european and japanese patent expiration dates are generally within one year before or after the us dates indicated except as follows 

 

2 as a result of certain patent litigation settlements we expect generic competition for detrol la  to commence in the us no earlier than january 1 2014 except in limited circumstances and no later than march 1 2014 

3  in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions to methods of manufacturing or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions for example in addition to the basic product patent covering viagra  it is also covered by a us methodoftreatment patent which including the sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period associated with revatio  which has the same active ingredient as viagra  expires in 2020 however in some cases such patents may not protect our drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

we copromote aricept  with eisai co ltd eisai we lost exclusivity for aricept  5mg and 10mg tablets in the us in november 2010 and in the majority of european markets in february 2012 and april 2012 we expect to lose exclusivity for the aricept  23mg tablet in the us in july 2013 for additional information including a description of certain of our other co 

promotion agreements and their expiration dates see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions  and the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights sections of the mda in our 2012 financial report and item 1a risk factors — dependence on key inline products below 

we lost exclusivity for lipitor  in the us in november 2011 lipitor  lost exclusivity in japan in june 2011 australia in april 2012 and most of developed europe in march 2012 and may 2012 in the us europe japan and australia lipitor now faces multisource generic competition in other international markets lipitor  has lost exclusivity in certain countries and will lose exclusivity at various times in other countries 

we lost exclusivity for xalatan  in the us in march 2011 we lost exclusivity for xalatan  and xalacom in the majority of european markets in january 2012 we lost exclusivity for geodon  in the us in march 2012 we lost exclusivity in the us in september 2012 for revatio tablet and in june 2012 for detrol immediate release    detrol ir  we lost exclusivity for detrol  in most european markets in september 2012 aromasin  effexoreffexor xr  extendedrelease formulation of effexor  zosyn  protonix  norvasc  and vfend  tablets are examples of other pfizer products that face generic competition in the us we also lost exclusivity for caduet  in the us in november 2011 and in the majority of european markets in march and may 2012 

for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights section of the mda in our 2012 financial report 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products viagra  lyrica  sutent  rapamune  epipen  torisel  pristiq  and embeda extendedrelease capsules    

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to otc products 

biotechnology products 

our biotechnology products including benefix  refacto  xyntha   enbrel  and the prevnarprevenar  family may face competition from biosimilars also referred to as “followon biologics” such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a biosimilar recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin  which was approved under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act 

abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us the regulatory implementation of these aca provisions is ongoing and expected to take several years however the fda has begun to clarify its expectations for approval via the biosimilar pathway with the issuance of three draft guidance documents in february 2012 see government regulation and price constraints — biosimilars  for additional information on the aca’s approval framework for biosimilars 

in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years and in japan the regulatory authority has granted marketing authorizations for certain biosimilars including somatropin the recombinant human growth hormone in our genotropin  product pursuant to a guideline for biosimilar approvals issued in 2009 

if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired however unlike small molecule generics biologics currently have additional barriers to entry related to the manufacture of such products and biosimilars are not necessarily identical to the reference products therefore generic competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as part of our business strategy we are developing biosimilar medicines using our expertise in biologics and our regulatory commercial and manufacturing strengths as such a betterdefined biosimilars approval pathway will assist us in pursuing approval of our own biosimilar products in the us see item 1a risk factors — biotechnology products  below 

we may face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue likewise as we enter the biosimilars area and seek to launch products patents may be asserted against us 

international 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2016 for leastdeveloped countries a number of countries have made improvements we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those countries we include further patent protection improvement among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries for additional information see government regulation and price constraints — intellectual property  below 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our human prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased drug companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and consumer healthcare manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products 

this competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in research and development as well as our business development transactions both designed to result in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

while our animal health operating segment is a market leader in nearly all of the major regions and sectors in which it operates it faces competition from other animal health businesses including those that are business units of other large pharmaceutical companies the principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region species product category or individual product and may include new product development quality price service and effective promotion to veterinary professionals pet owners and livestock producers 

our consumer healthcare operating segment faces competition from otc business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies as well as retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including among others the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources customer acceptance product quality our and our competitors’ introduction of new products ingredients claims dosage forms or other forms of innovation and pricing regulatory and legislative matters such as product labeling patient access and prescription to otc switches 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 260 million people in the us now participate in some form of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos the marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations continues to grow in importance 

mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators health maintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations eg staff or group model health maintenance organizations the purchasing power of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing numbers of patients enrolled in mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances both their purchasing strength and importance to us 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures mcos typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers also mcos use their purchasing power and their ability to influence market share and volume of prescription drugs to negotiate for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

as discussed above under marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies which are lists of approved medicines available to members that are tiered according to copay amounts and reimbursed by the respective pbm or mco formularies typically are based on the prices and therapeutic benefits or a combination of the two of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies 

the impact that mcos have on drug prices and volumes has increased as a result of their role in negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit medicare part d which took effect january 1 2006 mcos and pbms negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of the federal government for product access on medicare prescription drug plans’ pdps formularies we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products that are used by the senior population included on the formularies of the medicare pdps 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration unlike us generic competitors often operate without large research and development expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the body equivalent to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs 

including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute for brandname drugs generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary and pfizer injectables sell generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain competitors’ solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products respectively upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2012 and none are expected in 2013 however select materials have from time to time increased in price due to shortterm imbalances between supply and demand we have successfully secured the materials necessary to meet our requirements in these circumstances but generally at higher prices than those historically paid 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general  pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance in the us is the fda which has jurisdiction over our biopharmaceutical products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of these products the fda also regulates our consumer healthcare and animal health products other federal agencies including the us department of agriculture and the us drug enforcement administration also regulate some of our products 

in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services hhs office of the inspector general the federal trade commission ftc which also has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products including otc drugs and dietary supplements the department of justice doj and the sec individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various governmental bodies see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 17 commitments and contingencies  in our 2012 financial report such actions may involve product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

healthcare reform  in march 2010 the aca was enacted in the us the provisions of the aca are effective on various dates the principal provisions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry include 

 

as of february 2013 the congressional budget office estimates that the aca will result in the coverage of 27 million previously uninsured individuals by 2017 approximately half of this would occur through an expansion of the medicaid program effective in 2014 individuals with incomes below 133 of the federal poverty level fpl would be eligible for medicaid the remainder would be covered with private sector coverage either through their employers or new statebased health insurance exchanges health insurance exchanges with limited exceptions individuals who fail to purchase health 

insurance will pay a penalty which is an obligation commonly referred to as the individual mandate individuals with incomes between 100400 of the fpl will be eligible for subsidies to help pay for coverage 

the us supreme court reached a decision in june 2012 that upheld all provisions of the aca with the exception of the medicaid expansion now states can choose not to expand their medicaid populations without losing federal funding for their existing medicaid populations the congressional budget office estimates that the new state flexibility is likely to result in six million fewer new medicaid enrollees than were initially expected to enroll as a result of the eligibility expansion and that half of these people are expected to gain coverage through health insurance exchanges and the remaining three million are likely to remain uninsured 

the aca specifies certain benefits and services that must be covered for health insurers to qualify to participate in the health insurance exchanges the general categories of benefits and services that must be covered include ambulatory patient services emergency services hospitalization maternity and newborn care mental health and substance use disorder services including behavioral health treatment prescription drugs rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices laboratory services preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management and pediatric services including oral and vision care regulators have provided additional guidance to states on the types of benefits and services that must be covered 

expanding insurance coverage and other costs are expected to result in a relatively modest gain in overall pharmaceutical industry sales as the newly insured are principally young and relatively healthy at the same time the rebates discounts taxes and other costs associated with the aca are a significant cost to the industry 

the aca created the independent payment advisory board ipab a 15member panel appointed by the president subject to senate confirmation the ipab is charged with developing proposals to “reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending” in the event that the actual medicare per capita growth rate exceeds a specified target unless congress acts to alter the proposals the proposals will be automatically implemented however the ipab cannot directly ration care raise premiums increase cost sharing or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility if the ipab fails to act the secretary of hhs is directed to prepare such proposals the ipab is prohibited by statute from making payment reductions to certain sectors such as hospitals and home health agencies which increases the risk that the ipab will propose to limit access to pharmaceutical treatments or mandate price controls for our products 

the aca also established the patient centered outcomes research institute pcori a federally funded private nonprofit corporation empowered to fund and disseminate comparative effectiveness research cer and build infrastructure for improved outcomes analysis pcori has no authority to impose formulary changes directly in governmentfunded health programs however we expect that due to the pcori as well as the underlying market demand for datadriven differentiation cer studies will have growing influence on access overseeing and managing the pcori is an advisory board drawn from multiple and varied stakeholder organizations including the pharmaceutical industry pfizer’s chief medical officer currently serves as an industry representative on the advisory board 

changes in marketing activity disclosure  the aca expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse including amendments to both the false claims act and the antikickback statute to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes the aca also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud with expanded subpoena power for hhs additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement 

after significant delays starting in 2013 pharmaceutical manufacturers will be required to record any transfers of value made to doctors and teaching hospitals and to disclose such data to hhs with the initial disclosure to hhs due no later than march 31 2013 data collection and reporting will begin with the issuance of final guidance or regulations anticipated before the end of the first quarter of 2013 in addition to civil penalties for failure to report transfers of value to physicians or teaching hospitals there will be criminal penalties if a manufacturer intentionally makes false statements in such reports the payment data across biopharmaceutical and medical device companies will be posted by hhs on a publicly available website this increased access to such data by fraud and abuse investigators industry critics and media will draw attention to our collaborations with reported entities and will importantly provide opportunities to underscore the critical nature of our collaborations for developing medicine and exchanging scientific information this national payment transparency effort industry commitment to uphold voluntary codes of conduct such as the updated phrma code on interactions with healthcare professionals and phrma guiding principles direct to consumer advertisements about prescription medicines  and rigorous internal training and compliance efforts will complement existing laws and regulations to help ensure ethical collaboration and truthful product communications 

medicare  medicare part d went into effect on january 1 2006 elderly and disabled beneficiaries have access to the medicare drug benefit through private plans approved by the federal government beneficiaries with low incomes and modest assets are eligible for assistance with medicare part d plan premiums and cost sharing nationally the share of such beneficiaries with comprehensive drug coverage increased from 59 in 2005 to over 90 in 2011 medicare beneficiaries report high levels of satisfaction with an overwhelming majority saying the program works well in addition the program costs less than originally expected 

the aca made some important changes to the drug benefit which include in particular phasing out the coverage gap by 2020 prior to the aca beneficiaries who reached a certain level of spending on prescription medications the medicare part d coverage gap or “doughnut hole” had to pay 100 of the cost of their drugs until personal outofpocket spending reached a level qualifying them for catastrophic coverage the medicare part d coverage gap discount program uses public and private funding to relieve the financial burden facing beneficiaries who fall into this coverage gap beginning in 2011 branded pharmaceutical companies paid 50 of the cost of the branded drugs in the gap and the government paid 7 of the cost of the generic drugs in the gap as a result rather than paying 100 of the total cost of their drugs when they reached the coverage gap enrollees paid 50 of the total cost of branded drugs and 93 of the total cost of generic drugs the contribution from the government for generic drugs grew to 14 in 2012 and will grow steadily over time until reaching 75 in 2020 in addition starting in 2013 the 50 discount from branded pharmaceutical companies will be supplemented by a contribution from the government which will also grow steadily over time until reaching 25 in 2020 that means that by 2020 enrollees will pay only 25 of the cost of their branded and generic drugs in the gap 

biosimilars  the aca also created a framework for the approval of biosimilars also known as followon biologics following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation which will require the fda to address such key topics as the type and extent of data needed to establish biosimilarity the data required to achieve interchangeability compared to biosimilarity the naming convention for biosimilars the tracking and tracing of adverse events and the acceptability of data using a nonus licensed comparator to demonstrate biosimilarity andor interchangeability with a uslicensed reference product the fda has begun to address some of these issues with the february 2012 release of three draft guidance documents specifically the fda has clarified that biosimilar applicants may use a nonus licensed comparator in certain studies to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to a uslicensed reference product 

medicaid and related matters  federal law requires branded pharmaceutical companies to provide rebates to state medicaid agencies the aca brought about major changes in the medicaid program collectively the measures i increased federal rebates paid by manufacturers on branded drugs within the traditional medicaid program from 151 to 231 and for generic drugs from 11 to 13 of average manufacturer price amp ii expanded medicaid drug rebates to cover drugs provided through managed medicaid plans and iii changed the rebate rates for line extensions or new formulations of solid oral dosage form drugs postimplementation of aca the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms withdrew its former detailed ampcalculation rules and new cms amp guidance was published in proposed rule form in january 2012 a final rule is expected in mid2013 the law also creates a federal upper limit under the medicaid program for generic drugs at 175 of amp in addition the law expanded the types of entities eligible for the “section 340b discounts” for outpatient drugs that began in 2010 

the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain medicines to medicaid beneficiaries restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states access in the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state given states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises a growing number of states are considering a variety of costcontrol strategies including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments 

the aca expands medicaid coverage in 2014 the congressional budget office estimates between seven and 13 million additional people will be enrolled in medicaid by 2014 

we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — revenues — overview  section of the mda in our 2012 financial report and in the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 1g basis of presentation and significant accounting policies   revenues  in our 2012 financial report which are incorporated by reference 

pdufa reauthorization  the prescription drug user fee act pdufa was first enacted in 1992 to provide the fda with additional resources to speed the review of important new medicines prior to pdufa inadequate funding of the fda drug review process led to a backlog of application reviews and lengthy review times pdufa revolutionized the review 

process for new drugs and biologics without compromising high approval standards for demonstration of product safety quality and efficacy pdufa expires every five years and must be reauthorized by congress pdufa iv expired on september 30 2012 and was renewed as title i of the fda safety and innovation act fdasia in addition to pdufa v fdasia included a range of provisions important to the industry including new user fee requirements for biosimilar products and generics the pdufa v reauthorization reflected months of discussion between the fda industry and other stakeholders such as patient groups and consumers the current pdufa v agreement focuses on improving the efficiency and predictability of the review process strengthening the agency regulatory science base and enhancing benefitrisk assessment and postapproval safety surveillance 

budget control act of 2011  in august 2011 the federal budget control act of 2011 the budget control act was enacted in the us the budget control act includes provisions to raise the us treasury department’s borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling and provisions to reduce the federal deficit by 24 trillion between 2012 and 2021 deficitreduction targets include 900 billion of discretionary spending reductions associated with hhs and various agencies charged with national security but those discretionary spending reductions do not include programs such as medicare and medicaid or direct changes to pharmaceutical pricing rebates or discounts the office of management and budget omb is responsible for identifying the remaining 15 trillion of deficit reductions which will be divided evenly between defense and nondefense spending under this omb review process social security medicaid veteran benefits and certain other spending categories are excluded from consideration but reductions in payments to medicare providers may be made although any such reductions are prohibited by law from exceeding 2 of the originally budgeted amount additionally certain payments to medicare part d plans such as lowincome subsidy payments are exempt from reduction while we do not know the specific nature of the spending reductions under the budget control act that will affect medicare we do not expect that those reductions will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations however any significant spending reductions affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented andor any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us as part of any broader deficitreduction effort or legislative replacement for the budget control act could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

federal debt ceiling enforcement of the us federal debt ceiling has been suspended through may 18 2013 if the us federal government fails to suspend enforcement of the debt ceiling beyond may 18 2013 or to increase the debt ceiling and as a result is unable to satisfy its financial obligations including under medicare medicaid and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe canada japan china south korea and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

europe  the approval of new drugs across the eu may be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissioneuropean medicines agency ema centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the european economic area countries norway and iceland the use of these procedures generally provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

since the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states we continue to work with individual countries on such matters across the region 

the world economy in 2012 faced ongoing challenges and in particular continuing uncertainty around the solvency of governments as a result global growth has remained low with many eu countries experiencing a second recession in recent years one of the consequences of the economic challenges for almost all world economies has been an increase in public debt as a proportion of gross domestic product arising from increased government spending and reduced tax receipts for many developed economies particularly in europe this has exacerbated existing fiscal imbalances and has created doubt in investment markets about the sustainability of public debt levels in a number of european countries further raising the cost of borrowing with the result that financial support has been necessary from the eu to greece portugal ireland and spain and from the international monetary fund in the cases of greece portugal and ireland stringent austerity measures have been implemented in many european countries with the aim of closing the fiscal gap in particular in spain and italy 

under these macroeconomic conditions pfizer continues to face widespread downward pressures on international pricing and reimbursement particularly in developed european markets japan and in certain emerging markets all of which have a 

large government share of pharmaceutical spending and are facing a difficult fiscal environment specific pricing pressures in 2012 included measures to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditures in spain italy france greece ireland portugal and japan 

formal processes of international reference pricing irp between eu countries add to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries price variations also have arisen from exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and other european currencies and these also are exacerbated by international reference pricing systems the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to irp policies emergency measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries and ongoing exchange rate turbulence 

in january 2007 a new eu regulation on medicines for pediatric use became effective this introduced obligations on pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on their medicines for children and subject to various conditions offered the possibility of incentives for so doing including exclusivity extensions the aim of this regulation is to improve the health of children in the eu through highquality research stimulating the development of new medicines creating infrastructure to enable authorized use and improving the information on medicines for children a pediatric committee was created within the ema to provide scientific opinions and input on development plans for medicines for use with children in line with this regulation pfizer is conducting a number of pediatric research programs for its inline and development products 

in july 2012 new pharmacovigilance legislation came into force in the eu which included many new and revised requirements that impact pfizer’s global safety system key changes include the establishment of a new pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee within the ema with wide responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the eu authorities accordingly it will be possible for regulators in the eu to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization efficacy studies both at the time of approval and at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional requirements to include statements in product labeling with regard to adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products the new legislation also introduces significantly greater transparency of the safety review process 

the new legislation forms part of a threepart “pharmaceutical package” to amend the existing eu pharmaceutical legislation the second part the falsified medicines directive is a directive aimed at preventing falsified medicines from entering into the legal supply chain notably the directive imposes new obligations on all parties in the distribution chain including importers traders manufacturers distributors and any operator who repackages a product member states must transpose the directive into national law and apply its provisions from january 2013 onwards the directive also provides the legal basis of a number of implementation measures to be adopted by the european commission most of these implementation measures are expected to be adopted between 2013 and 2014 and will not be applicable until three years after the date of publication the third part of the package concerned the provision of information on prescription medicines to patients which proved controversial and has been discontinued 

transparency is a key theme and priority for the european commission and ema in the pharmaceutical area particularly with regard to clinical trial results and data submitted for marketing authorization in the eu recently the ema has disclosed significantly more of such data upon request than in previous years and the ema announced its intention to publish additional data in the future 

at the end of the third quarter of 2010 the commissioner for industry and entrepreneurship of the european commission announced the launch of a process on corporate responsibility in the pharmaceutical industry the process which is expected to officially conclude in midapril 2013 included three independent platforms i transparency and ethics in the sector ii access to medicines in africa and iii access to medicines in europe in the context of pricing and reimbursement no specific outcomes have yet been determined following the work undertaken by the platforms but these discussions are likely to drive requests for future change for example on transparency and ethics in the pharmaceutical area 

canada  health canada hc is the government agency that provides regulatory and marketing approval for drugs and therapeutic products in canada in october 2012 the federal minister of health announced the government’s intention to i reintroduce the legislative and regulatory modernization lrm regulatory framework which was originally presented to parliament in october 2010 and ii introduce “orphanet” to canada orphanet is an international consortium of countries that seeks to improve the diagnosis care and treatment of patients with rare disorders the upcoming lrm regulatory framework is the most significant drug regulatory system reform in canada in over 50 years and is expected to overhaul canada’s food and drugs act and regulations the lrm supports a “lifecycle” regulatory approach and is focused on strengthening evidencebased decisionmaking good regulatory planning licensing postlicensing accountability authority and enforcement through this framework hc intends to improve the market authorization process and implement necessary regulatory frameworks 

introductory “nonexcessive” prices and price increases are controlled by the federal patented medicines prices review board however reimbursement is under provincial jurisdiction as provinces continue to face budget pressure from growing 

healthcare expenditures many provincial governments have developed pricing and purchasing strategies including product listing agreements and a pancanadian purchasing alliance initiative to obtain better drug prices the private sector is also attempting to exert its negotiating power on drug manufacturers 

the 2004 federal provincial territorial fpt health accord that sets out the canada health transfers payment a budgetary mechanism that provides for funding to provincial governments by the federal government plus commitments on health policy initiatives expires on march 31 2014 in advance of the 2014 expiration of the fpt health accord the federal government announced in december 2011 a new funding framework that confirms its health transfer funding policy until 2024 and assuming canada achieves its projected gross domestic product growth target of 3 provides for funding growth of 6 annually through 20162017 

asia  the regulatory environment in asia presents multiple issues for companies trying to achieve simultaneous global development and registration ie marketing products at the same time as in the us europe canada and elsewhere while each country in asia has its unique regulatory concerns there are a number of regulatory issues that are common among the majority of countries in asia for example with the exception of japan health authorities in asia generally require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority eg the us fda before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval proof of reference country approval is usually satisfied by submitting a certificate of pharmaceutical product a legal document that is issued by the competent health authority certifying that the company’s product has satisfied its country’s registration requirements and manufacturing standards often this requirement delays marketing authorization in asia by 1215 months following marketing authorization in the us and europe 

another common regulatory issue in asia is the requirement for local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval each of japan china south korea taiwan india and vietnam has regulations that in some form require clinical studies in the country eg china requires a prescribed number of chinese patients regardless of the product therapeutic area or disease population although some agencies have shown flexibility based on scientific rationale related to ethnicity assessments it is not uncommon for companies to be required to duplicate costly clinical trials in asia pursuant to these regulations this can further add to marketing approval delays compared to the us and europe additionally similar requirements for local clinical data exist outside of asia in countries such as mexico and russia where we try to ensure their inclusion in global clinical studies where feasible or conduct additional studies there which further delays marketing authorization in those countries 

in japan the government is aiming to reduce the drug lag ie drugs are often launched in japan years after the eu and us markets in a twopronged approach reducing regulatory agency review times and establishing a new pilot pricing premium the pilot pricing premium provides a financial incentive for drug development in japan while economic conditions and government debt levels continue to put pressure on healthcare costs resulting in cost containment particularly in the offpatent sector the recent extension of the pilot pricing premium for innovative products is encouraging 

in south korea the national health insurance deficit prompted the government to make significant price cuts in the offpatent sector effective april 2012 we continue to work with a committee established by the government to improve the pricing system for innovative new drugs 

the controlling regulatory agency in china is the state food and drug administration sfda sfda’s scope of responsibilities is similar to that of the fda and ema two key agencies within sfda are the center for drug evaluation cde and the national institutes for food and drug control nifdc the cde which is analogous to the fda’s center for drug evaluation and research is primarily responsible for the technical review of product applications including clinical trial applications and new drug applications and drafting technical guidance documents nifdc is the quality testing arm of sfda responsible for the testing of pharmaceuticals biologics and medical devices nationwide 

china’s regulatory system is unique in many ways and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with international standards as a result it is not uncommon to see treatments entering the market in china two to five years after first marketing in the us and europe there are three main contributing elements for this delay i clinical trial authorization approval times that are five to 10 times longer than international standards and add greater than 12 months to development time ii significant local chinese patient number requirements for biologic products regardless of product characteristics or disease prevalence and iii although the sfda has improved its framework for more transparency a formal agency consultation structure which would enable manufacturers to better align with the agency on the complexities of its drug development requirements and policies has not been established 

intellectual property  while the global intellectual property environment has improved following wtotrips our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection see patents and intellectual property rights above in emerging market countries in particular governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for 

reducing the price of imported medicines as well as to protect their national pharmaceutical industries there is considerable political pressure to weaken existing intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions eg new medical treatment methods and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers 

in december 2012 the eu approved an eu patent package which was agreed to by 25 out of 27 eu member states excluding italy and spain which opted out but which are free to opt back in this will create a unitary eu patent ie a uniform patent with equal effect that will be granted transferred and enforced in a unitary way through participating member states patent grants will continue to be granted through the existing european patent office but a new court system will be set up to enforce such patents and hear revocation actions the central division of the new court will be in paris although a section based in london will hear chemical and pharmaceutical cases the new regime reduces the translation requirement should allow patentees to obtain paneuropean injunctions and damages and should reduce forumshopping in europe for patent holders seeking to enforce their patents as well as generic manufacturers alleging patent invalidity or noninfringement the eu patent package will enter into force on january 1 2014 or after 13 european countries have ratified it whichever is later 

canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity but is generally perceived to be less predictable than the intellectual property regimes of comparable countries through intense negotiations as part of the canadaeu comprehensive economic  trade agreement ceta the canadian intellectual property regime may be further enhanced by eu demands to align their respective intellectual property regimes canada recently joined the transpacific trade partnership tpp and it is expected that more pressure to improve its intellectual property regime will arise if nothing results from the ceta agreement 

in china the intellectual property environment has improved although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with world trade organization wto provisions and several companies including pfizer have established research and development centers in china due to increased confidence in china’s intellectual property environment despite this china remained on the us department of commerce priority watch list for 2012 further the standards for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in other major markets including the us europe and japan also while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent such as the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage 

additionally true regulatory data protection remains elusive in china the center for drug evaluation provides protection against reliance on data by generic applicants for a fixed period of time following its wto accession in 2001 china revised its laws to incorporate concepts from the wtotrips and china’s relevant laws establish a sixyear period of protection against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test and other data of products containing a new chemical ingredient however the current regulations are ambiguous as to how data protection is implemented in practice in china for example certain key concepts such as “new chemical ingredient” and “unfair commercial use” are undefined 

in brazil and other latin american countries backlogs at patent agencies have presented challenges for the protection of certain products the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions such as new medical uses of drug products may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products 

in india policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents the increasing tendency of the indian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to protect many of our inventions india and other countries such as israel maintain a system of pregrant patent oppositions that delay the granting of patents and add an additional challenge in our ability to protect our products through patents 

in south korea the laws and regulations for the patentregulatory approval linkage system were finalized and implemented as part of the united stateskorea free trade agreement in 2012 the korean patentregulatory approval linkage system includes biologics 

environmental law compliance 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 17 commitments and contingencies  in our 2012 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2012 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we have no reason to believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

while there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we have reviewed the potential for these risks and have concluded that because of our facility locations and our existing distribution networks we do not believe these risks are material in the near term

employees 

in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 91500 people in our operations throughout the world including approximately 9300 people in our animal health operations 

disclosure pursuant to section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra requires disclosure by public companies of certain transactions involving the government of iran or other entities and individuals targeted by certain us sanctions administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac in some instances itrshra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they were permissible under us law or were conducted by a nonus affiliate in accordance with the local law under which such entity operates 

as a global biopharmaceutical company we conduct business in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world during 2012 our activities included supplying lifesaving medicines nutritional supplements and other medical products pfizer products for patient and consumer use in iran and syria us law allows us to seek and rely on licenses issued by ofac to supply pfizer products to customers in these countries for both human and animal use we ship these pfizer products pursuant to such licenses and we conduct our activities in accordance with our internal policies which follow requirements set forth in the laws of the us and other applicable jurisdictions we will continue our global activities to improve the health and wellbeing of humans and animals in a manner consistent with applicable laws and our internal policies 

to our knowledge none of our activities during 2012 are required to be disclosed pursuant to itrshra with the following possible exceptions 

 20 

and as a result subsequently received certain payments not all funds related to these transactions have been received from bank tejarat where required we have requested us government authorization to process the funds received and to be received for funds received in 2012 our estimated gross revenues associated with these transactions were euro 222962 other than as set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information  including the tables therein captioned selected income statement information geographic information and significant product revenues  in our 2012 financial report and in the table captioned revenues by segment and geographic area in the mda in our 2012 financial report we do not allocate net profit on a countrybycountry or activitybyactivity basis and thus cannot provide specific net profits ascribable to this activity pfizer’s net profits attributable to these transactions in 2012 were a fraction of the gross revenues 

 

we have informed our customers that in connection with future transactions with pfizer bank tejarat siib and any other banks designated as sdns under executive order 13382 are not to be used

risk factors 

tableend

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2012 form 10k and in our 2012 annual report to shareholders contain forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “will” “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “target” “forecast” “goal” “objective” and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of among other things our anticipated future operating or financial performance business plans and prospects inline products and product candidates strategic reviews capital allocation businessdevelopment plans and plans relating to share repurchases and dividends in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings plans relating to share repurchases and dividends government regulation and financial results including in particular the financial guidance set forth in the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our financial guidance for 2013 section of the mda in our 2012 financial report and the anticipated costs and cost reductions set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and costreductionproductivity initiatives section of the mda in our 2012 financial report 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forwardlooking statements 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10q and 8k reports and our other filings with the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

us healthcare reformhealthcare legislation 

as mentioned above under government regulation and price constraints  the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and its provisions become effective on various dates we expect that the rebates discounts taxes and other costs resulting from the aca over time will have a significant effect on our expenses and profitability in the future see the discussion under the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our operating environment — us healthcare legislation  section of the mda in our 2012 financial report and in item 1 business  under the caption government regulation and price constraints  furthermore the ipab created by the aca to reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending could potentially limit access to certain treatments or mandate price controls for our products moreover expanded government investigative authority may increase the costs of compliance with new regulations and programs we also face the uncertainties that might result from any modification repeal or invalidation of any of the provisions of the aca 

us deficit reduction and debt ceiling actions 

as discussed above under government regulation and price constraints — budget control act of 2011  while we do not know the specific nature of the spending reductions under the budget control act that will affect medicare we do not expect that those reductions will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations however any significant spending reductions affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented 

andor any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us as part of any broader deficitreduction effort or legislative replacement to the budget control act could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

similarly as discussed above under government regulation and price constraints — federal debt ceiling  the possible failure of the us federal government to suspend enforcement of the federal debt ceiling beyond may 18 2013 or to increase the federal debt ceiling and any resulting inability of the federal government to satisfy its financial obligations including making payments under medicare medicaid and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

pricing pressures and government regulation 

us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies in the us many of our biopharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures have increased as a result of the 2003 medicare modernization act 2003 mma due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in addition if the 2003 mma or the aca were amended to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions it would have a significant adverse impact on our business furthermore mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including among others changes in patent laws restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines further there continue to be legislative proposals to amend us laws to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs which can be sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to welldocumented safety concerns such as the increased risk of counterfeit products entering the supply chain such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us 

the prohibition against the use of federal funds for reimbursement of erectile dysfunction medications by the medicaid program which became effective january 1 2006 and the similar federal funding prohibition for the medicare part d program which became effective january 1 2007 has had an adverse effect on our business any prohibitions on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of other classes of drugs in the future may also have an adverse effect 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe canada china south korea and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for governmentsponsored healthcare systems in particular there were governmentmandated price reductions for certain biopharmaceutical products in japan and certain european and emerging market countries in 2012 and we anticipate continuing pricing pressures in japan europe and emerging markets in 2013 this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions failure to obtain timely or adequate governmentapproved pricing or formulary placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccines business we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business 

managed care trends 

mcos and other private insurers frequently adopt their own payment or reimbursement reductions consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of these entities private thirdparty payers as well as governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue in addition to formulary tier copay differentials private health insurance companies and selfinsured employers have been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us payer market 

concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time which can adversely affect our business as discussed above a number of our current products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years 

also the patents covering several of our medicines including viagra  lyrica  sutent  rapamune  epipen  torisel  pristiq  and embeda  extendedrelease capsules are being challenged by generic manufacturers in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with ours including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

dependence on key inline products 

we recorded direct product revenues of more than 1 billion for each of 10 biopharmaceutical products in 2012 lyrica  lipitor  enbrel  prevnar 13prevenar 13  celebrex  viagra  norvasc  zyvox  sutent  and the premarin  family those products accounted for 49 of our total biopharmaceutical revenues in 2012 if these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant as noted patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years including some of our billiondollar and previously billiondollar products such as lipitor and xalatanxalacom  and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products 

further our alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time for example our rights to aricept  in japan returned to eisai in december 2012 our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim for spiriva  expires on a countrybycountry basis between 2012 and 2016 including the expiration in certain eu markets canada and australia in 2012 our us and canada collaboration agreement with amgen inc amgen for enbrel  will expire in october 2013 our exclusive rights to enbrel outside the us and canada will not be affected by the expiration of the copromotion agreement with amgen and our collaboration agreement with emd serono inc serono to copromote rebif in the us will expire either at the end of 2013 or the end of 2015 depending on the outcome of pending litigation between us and serono concerning the interpretation of the agreement see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income — biopharmaceutical — selected product descriptions and overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights  sections of the mda in our 2012 financial report for additional information on the expirations of these agreements 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products and the development of additional uses for existing products are necessary for the continued strength of our business our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity as well as to provide for revenue and earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products 

that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers either through internal research and development or through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

additionally our research and development investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipeline could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the science may not work for any given program despite the significant investment required for research and development 

in 2011 we announced a focus on fewer disease areas where we believe we can deliver the greatest medical and commercial success as well as the implementation of our rd footprint reduction by moving forward on our productivity initiatives there can be no assurance that this strategy will deliver the desired result in the targeted timeframe or at all which could affect profitability in the future 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products and there is no assurance that any of our late stage pipeline products will receive regulatory approval andor be commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets andor be commercially successful there is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings should they occur 

there are many considerations that can affect the marketing of our products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete or adequately design and implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that can adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements further claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in a negative impact on product sales product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims also increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the riskbenefit profile of products as they relate to alreadyapproved products has resulted in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for among other things additional clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies see postapproval data  below 

in addition failure to put in place adequate controls andor resources for effective collection reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance see postapproval data  below in compliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety regulatory actions and risks to product sales 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase iv trials could result in loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 the fdaaa gave the fda enhanced postmarket authority including the explicit authority to require postmarket studies and clinical trials labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with fdaapproved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies the fda’s exercise of its authority under the fdaaa has in some cases resulted and in the future could result in delays or increased costs during product development clinical trials and regulatory review increased costs to comply with additional postapproval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products nonus regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable costs for 

example a postmarketing study as part of a postapproval commitment to marketing authorization is becoming more common in china where the sfda requires additional clinical data in the chinese population in order to further assess the safety and efficacy of a product sometimes independent of the level of global clinical data available postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect sales of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate or are perceived to implicate an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of the affected products accordingly new data about our products or products similar to our products could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in updated labeling restrictions on use product withdrawal or recall furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of our products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of our products 

patent protection 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our products using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis similarly any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis if at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinctive  patent laws we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including among others claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term 

our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as a result of local political pressure or in the case of national emergencies in addition mechanisms exist in much of the world permitting some form of challenge by competitors or generic drug marketers to our patents prior to or immediately following the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights   further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property including because such agreements expire or are terminated our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

likewise in the us and other countries we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third party objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same as our products mature our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow by requiring our employees consultants other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these efforts and precautions we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise 

biotechnology products 

as discussed above in patents and intellectual property  and government regulation and price constraints — biosimilars  abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure the expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired we may face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue 

we are developing biosimilar medicines the developing pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products in the us could diminish the value of our past and future investments in biosimilars other risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products there is also a risk of lower prescriptions of biosimilars due to potential concerns over comparability with innovator medicines 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities once the drug receives approval for example more detailed studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process but each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit and the potential delays to approval of the primary indication we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably foresee challenges but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between speed trial conduct and desired outcome will be achieved each time the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results 

foreign exchange and interest rate risk 

significant portions of our revenues and earnings as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 61 of our total 2012 revenues were derived from international operations including 26 from the europe region and 21 from the japan and the rest of asia region as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the japanese yen the uk pound the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses if the us dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency our revenues will increase having a positive impact and our overall expenses will increase having a negative impact on net income likewise if the us dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency our revenues will decrease having a negative impact and our overall expenses will decrease having a positive impact on net income therefore significant changes in foreign exchange rates including the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates can impact our results and our financial guidance 

in addition our interestbearing investments and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the forwardlooking information and factors that may affect future results — financial risk management  section of the mda in our 2012 financial report for additional details see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 7e financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2012 financial report those sections of our 2012 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations also could be affected by currency fluctuations capital and exchange controls expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of the world’s largest markets leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s global performance as a result we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets however there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that these countries will continue to sustain these growth rates in addition some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending which as discussed above can adversely affect our results 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products has generated payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector while the impact on us of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has been limited to date our growing portfolio of specialty products combined with the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world and the deteriorating finances of certain governments may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future 

animal health 

the animal health operating segment may be impacted by among other things emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources adverse global economic conditions and failure of the rd acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products   see global economic conditions  below 

consumer healthcare 

the consumer healthcare operating segment may be impacted by economic volatility the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal andor reformulation of certain products eg coughcold products see global economic conditions  below 

global economic conditions 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the us and europe including the countries that use the euro affecting the performance of products such as lyrica  enbrel  prevnar 13prevenar 13  and celebrex  and in a number of emerging markets we believe that patients experiencing the effects of the challenging economic environment including high unemployment levels and increases in copays sometimes switch to generic products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments to reduce their costs challenging economic conditions in the us also have increased the number of patients in the medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and in many states to formulary restrictions limiting access to brandname drugs including ours in addition we continue to experience pricing pressure in various markets around the world including in developed european markets japan and in a number of emerging markets with governmentmandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products and governmentimposed access restrictions in certain countries 

the challenging global economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate it will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources due to our significant operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as market conditions change we continue to monitor our liquidity position however there can be no assurance that our liquidity or capital resources will not be affected by possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions 

other potential impacts of these challenging economic conditions include declining sales increased costs changes in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of or a lower rate of return on our financial assets and pension plan investments which may require us to increase our pension funding obligations adverse government actions delays or failures 

in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

outsourcing 

we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial execution nonclinical research safety services and other areas for example during 2012 we implemented the transfer of approximately 200 ongoing clinical trials to two strategic partners clinical research organizations or cros and any issues with either or both of these cros may adversely impact the progression of our clinical trial programs outsourcing of services to third parties could also expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery which may result in missed deadlines supply disruptions noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our results 

we continue to pursue a multiyear initiative to outsource some transactionprocessing activities within certain accounting processes and are migrating to a consistent enterprise resource planning system across the organization these are enhancements of ongoing activities to support the growth of our financial shared service capabilities and standardize our financial systems if any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of the new system were to occur they could adversely affect our operations including among other ways through a failure to meet demand for our products or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations 

interactions with healthcare professionals and government officials 

risks and uncertainties apply where we provide something of value to a healthcare professional andor government official which if found to be improper could potentially result in government enforcement actions and penalties these risks may increase as nonus jurisdictions adopt new antibribery laws and regulations 

difficulties of our wholesale distributors 

in 2012 our largest wholesale distributor accounted for approximately 12 of our total revenue and 28 of our total us revenue and our top three wholesale distributors accounted for approximately 28 of our total revenue and 68 of our total us revenue if one of our significant wholesale distributors should encounter financial or other difficulties such distributor might decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we might be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions shutdowns approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions or shortages reputational harm product liability unanticipated costs or otherwise examples of such difficulties or delays include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network andor comply with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulations or risk to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or manmade disasters at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor 

counterfeit products 

a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured — in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and often unsanitary sites — as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines which is exacerbated by the complexity of our supply chain could adversely impact our business by among other things causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines 

cost and expense controlunusual eventsintangible assets and goodwill 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of our costreduction and productivity initiatives including those related to our research and development function 

in addition our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets will ultimately yield successful products the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future for goodwill we have seven reporting units with associated goodwill balances and while we do not believe that the risk of goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units is significant at this time all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including among others changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including tax rate changes new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals competition laws privacy laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities antitrust environmental employment and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid 

our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid drug rebate program the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other federal and state statutes including those discussed elsewhere in this 2012 form 10k as well as antikickback and false claims laws and similar laws in foreign jurisdictions like many companies in our industry we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as by consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense civil payments fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries for example these claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social media mobile applications and blogger outreach 

in connection with the resolution of certain us government investigations concerning various products in september 2009 we entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services which is effective through december 31 2014 in connection with the resolution of our fcpa matters in august 2012 one of our subsidiaries entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the us department of justice which has a term of approximately two years in the cia and dpa we agreed to implement andor maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program and fda requirements and antibribery and anticorruption and other applicable laws a material failure to comply with the cia or dpa could result in severe sanctions against us 

patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through acquisitions licensing and alliances see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook — our business development initiatives  section of the mda in our 2012 financial report which is incorporated by reference however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities and competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transactions 

information technology and security 

significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology systems and those of our third party vendors with whom we contract make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions the size and complexity of our and our vendors’ systems and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties we and our vendors could be susceptible to third party attacks on our information security systems which attacks are of ever increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise including criminal groups “hactivists” and others while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive information and any such interruption or breach could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us 

failure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitions 

our future results may be affected by i the impact of and our ability to successfully execute any strategic alternative we may decide to pursue with regard to our remaining ownership stake in zoetis as well as any other corporate strategic initiatives we may pursue in the future and ii our ability to realize the projected benefits of any acquisitions divestitures or other initiatives we may pursue in the future

biopharmaceutical products 

revenues from biopharmaceutical products contributed approximately 86 of our total revenues in 2011 87 of our total revenues in 2010 and 92 of our total revenues in 2009 

we recorded direct product sales of more than 1 billion for each of 12 biopharmaceutical products in 2011 each of 15 biopharmaceutical products in 2010 and each of nine legacy pfizer biopharmaceutical products in 2009 these products represented 56 of our revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2011 60 of our revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2010 and 56 of our revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2009 see item 1a risk factors – dependence on key inline products below 

worldwide revenues from biopharmaceutical products in 2011 were 577 billion a decrease of 1 compared to 2010 primarily due to the decrease of 47 billion in operational revenues from lipitor  effexor  protonix  xalatan  caduet  vfend  aromasin and zosyn  and lower alliance revenues for aricept  all due to loss of exclusivity in certain markets and a reduction in revenues of 359 million due to the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act commonly referred to as the affordable care act or aca this decrease was partially offset by the solid performance of lyrica  the prevnarprevenar franchise and enbrel  the inclusion of operational revenues from legacy king products of approximately 950 million which favorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by 2 and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 17 billion or 3 

geographically in the us revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 9 in 2011 compared to 2010 reflecting lower revenues from lipitor  protonix  effexor  zosyn  xalatan  vfend  caduet and aromasin  all due to loss of exclusivity lower alliance revenues due to loss of exclusivity of aricept 5mg and 10mg tablets in november 2010 and lower revenues from detroldetrol la  as well as the reduction in revenues of 359 million in 2011 due to the aca the impact of these adverse factors was partially offset by the strong performance of certain other biopharmaceutical products and the addition of us revenues from legacy king products of approximately 904 million in 2011 

for additional information regarding the impact of the aca on our revenues see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook – our operating environment – us healthcare legislation section of the mda in our 2011 financial report 

in our international markets revenues from biopharmaceutical products increased 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 reflecting the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 6 in 2011 partially offset by a net operational decrease operationally revenues were favorably impacted by increases in the prevenar franchise lyrica  enbrel  celebrex and alliance revenues and unfavorably impacted by declines in lipitor  effexor  norvasc and xalatanxalacom  international revenues from legacy king products were not significant to our international revenues in 2011 during 2011 international revenues from biopharmaceutical products represented 59 of total revenues from biopharmaceutical products compared to 56 in 2010

 we currently are conducting the communityacquired pneumonia immunization trial in adults capita to fulfill requirements in connection with the fda’s approval of the prevnar 13 adult indication under its accelerated approval program capita is an efficacy trial involving subjects 65 years of age and older that is designed to evaluate whether prevnar 13 is effective in preventing the first episode of communityacquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes contained in the vaccine we estimate that this eventdriven trial will be completed in 2013 at its regular meeting held on february 22 2012 the us centers for disease control and prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices acip indicated that it will defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older until the results of capita as well as data on the impact of pediatric use of prevnar 13 on the disease burden and serotype distribution among adults are available we expect that the rate of uptake for the use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older will be impacted by acip’s decision to defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 by that population

 in december 2011 which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2012 for our international operations we completed our acquisition of the consumer healthcare business of ferrosan holding as a danish company engaged in the sale of sciencebased consumer healthcare products including dietary supplements and lifestyle products primarily in the nordic region and the emerging markets of russia and central and eastern europe 

nutrition 

pfizer nutrition is a leader in infant nutritionals in the markets in which we operate we have a targeted geographic presence in key markets throughout asia the middle east europe and latin america our largest markets include china the philippines the uk mexico and australia and more than 80 of our revenues are in emerging markets since it became part of pfizer in 2009 the nutrition business has grown in new and existing markets through innovation and developing and launching a number of new products nutrition’s revenues totaled 21 billion in 2011 an increase of 15 compared to 2010 reflecting higher operational revenues of 11 and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 4 the operational revenue increase was primarily due to increased demand for premium products launches of new products and strength in china and the middle east 

nutrition products include infant milk formula brands for newborns and toddlers our gold line includes brands s26 andor sma brand names vary slightly from country to country and in 2011 we launched our superpremium illuma brand we also commercialize specialty formulas such as s26 gold hypoallergenic  s26 gold antiregurgitation  s26 gold lactosefree  and s26 picky eater 

  

the company is exploring strategic alternatives for nutrition which may include among other things a full or partial separation from pfizer through a spinoff sale or other transaction see general above

capsugel 

on august 1 2011 we sold our capsugel business for approximately 24 billion in cash results of capsugel as well as the gain on its sale are reflected in discontinued operations through the date of sale capsugel was a business that had a diverse product line of hard gelatin capsules and liquid softgel nonanimal and fish gelatin capsules all for use in pharmaceutical and dietary supplement dosage delivery for additional information see the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 2d acquisitions divestitures collaborative arrangements and equity method arrangements – divestitures in our 2011 financial report 

research and development 

innovation by our research and development operations is very important to our success as a result and also because we are predominantly a human health company the vast majority of our research and development spending is associated with human health products compounds and activities our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs we spent 91 billion in 2011 94 billion in 2010 and 78 billion in 2009 on research and development 

biopharmaceutical rd 

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects as well as our product lines through collaborations alliance and license agreements acquisitions and other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable according to the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma out of 500010000 screened compounds only 250 enter preclinical testing five enter human clinical trials and one is approved by the fda the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

as of yearend 2011 we had 262 projects in research and development ranging from discovery through registration of which 95 programs are in phase 1 through registration with the remainder of the projects in preclinical development at yearend 2011 our phase iii portfolio contained 22 programs development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple different programs while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses or indications for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth in the analysis of the consolidated statements of income – product developments – biopharmaceutical section of the mda in our 2011 financial report that information is incorporated by reference 

  

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and products in development as well as unanticipated product obsolescence 

we continue to closely evaluate our global research and development function and pursue strategies to improve innovation and overall productivity by prioritizing areas with the greatest scientific and commercial promise utilizing appropriate riskreturn profiles and focusing on areas with the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time to that end our research primarily focuses on five highpriority areas that have a mix of small and large molecules – immunology and inflammation oncology cardiovascular metabolic and endocrine diseases neuroscience and pain and vaccines in addition to reducing the number of disease areas of focus we are realigning and reducing our research and development footprint and outsourcing certain functions that do not drive competitive advantage for pfizer as a result of these actions we expect significant reductions in our annual research and development expenses which are reflected in our 2012 financial guidance and we expect to incur significant costs which are also reflected in our 2012 financial guidance for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook – our strategy and – our financial guidance for 2012 and costs and expenses – restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and costreductionproductivity initiatives sections of the mda in our 2011 financial report

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same segments as our us operations with our operations in emerging markets for human pharmaceutical products managed through the established products and emerging markets segment 

revenues from operations outside the us of 405 billion accounted for 60 of our total revenues in 2011 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 18 countries outside the us in 2011 the us is our largest national market comprising 40 of total revenues in 2011 43 of total revenues in 2010 and 44 of total revenues in 2009 japan is our secondlargest national market with 9 of total revenues in 2011 75 of total revenues in 2010 and 87 of total revenues in 2009 

for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues see the table captioned geographic information in the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 18 segment geographic and other revenue information in our 2011 financial report and the table captioned revenues by segment and geographic area in the mda in our 2011 financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws and regulations on pricing reimbursement and access to our products see government regulation and price constraints below for a discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2011 both revenues and net income were favorably impacted by foreign exchange in general as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar increased our revenues and net income in many countries while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments depending upon market conditions see the discussions in the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 7e financial instruments – derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2011 financial report 

  

marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical businesses we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos employers and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

our biopharmaceutical businesses include five human health customerfocused business units primary care specialty care oncology established products and emerging markets our specialty care customerfocused business unit includes vaccines we operate in customerfocused business units within our biopharmaceutical businesses to better meet the diverse needs of physicians patients and our customers while maximizing value for our company and our shareholders 

our us primary care operations are structured into regional units in order to create a more flexible organization empowered to identify and address local market dynamics and customer needs our structure aligns the sales marketing and medical functions to work closely to meet the needs of key customer groups while ensuring common coordination focus and accountability across the organizations 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies and in the case of prevnar 13  directly to individual provider offices in the us we seek to gain access to healthcare authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended approved andor reimbursed medicines and other products we also work with mcos pbms employers and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

during 2011 pfizer revenues from our three largest biopharmaceutical wholesalers were as follows 

 

  

  

 sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the biopharmaceutical businesses apart from these instances none of our operating segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers 

each of our global animal health consumer healthcare and nutrition business units utilizes its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products and each occasionally uses distributors in smaller markets 

our animal health business unit’s advertising and promotions are generally targeted to veterinary healthcare professionals animal health products are sold directly to veterinarians and livestock producers as well as through distributors and retail outlets 

our consumer healthcare business unit’s advertising and promotions are generally disseminated to consumers through television print digital and other media advertising as well as through instore promotion consumer healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies retail chains and grocery and convenience stores 

our nutrition business unit fully supports and adheres to the world health organization code and national codes on the marketing of breast milk substitutes pfizer nutrition encourages breastfeeding as the best nutrition 

  

for infants and provides important products for infants who are not exclusively breastfed advertising and promotion of our nutrition products adhere to the aim and principles of the world health organization code as a minimum standard consistent with national legislation consequently we do not advertise breast milk substitutes but rather products intended for older children and adults where permitted such activities are aimed at healthcare professionals and consumers through media advertising print television internet our nutrition products are available to consumers in a wide variety of channels including pharmacies hospitals and food retailers supermarkets grocery stores and convenience stores 

patents and intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country further patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period andor the granted patent term extension are those for the drugs set forth in the table below the basic patents for these products in other large markets may expire in the same earlier or later years 

 

 1 with respect to the products in the table above the corresponding european and japanese patent expiration dates are generally within one year before or after the us dates indicated except as follows 

 

   

 in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions to methods of manufacturing or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions for example in addition to the basic product patent covering viagra  it is also covered by a us method of treatment patent which including the sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period associated with revatio  which has the same active ingredient as viagra  expires in 2020 however in some cases such patents may not protect our drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

we copromote aricept with eisai enbrel with amgen and spiriva with bi see biopharmaceutical products – biopharmaceutical – selected product descriptions for a further discussion 

we lost exclusivity for lipitor in the us on november 30 2011 pfizer announced in june 2008 that we entered into an agreement providing a license to ranbaxy to sell generic versions of lipitor and caduet in the us effective november 30 2011 in addition the agreement provides a license for ranbaxy to sell a generic version of lipitor beginning on varying dates in several additional countries see the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 17 commitments and contingencies for a discussion of certain litigation relating to this agreement we also granted watson pharmaceuticals inc watson the exclusive right to sell the authorized generic version of lipitor in the us for a period of five years which commenced on november 30 2011 as watson’s exclusive supplier we manufacture and sell generic atorvastatin tablets to watson we expect the entry of multisource generic competition in the us with attendant increased competitive pressures following the end of ranbaxy’s 180day generic exclusivity period in late may 2012 in markets outside the us lipitor has lost exclusivity in certain countries and will lose exclusivity at various times in other countries in europe although the lipitor compound patent expired in november 2011 we have obtained pediatric extensions in the eu accordingly exclusivity in the majority of the major european markets has been extended for six months to may 2012 see the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 17 commitments and contingencies in our 2011 financial report regarding pending legal challenges to our lipitor patents 

xalatan lost exclusivity in the us in march 2011 xalatan and xalacom lost exclusivity in 15 major european markets in january 2012 

effexoreffexor xr  zosyn  protonix  xalatan  norvasc and vfend tablets are examples of other pfizer products that currently face generic competition in the us 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor  viagra  detroldetrol la  lyrica  tygacil  sutent  rapamune  zyvox  avinza  epipen  torisel and embeda wyeth and a subsidiary of wyeth are defendants in a lawsuit alleging that their refacto af and xyntha products infringe the patents of another company 

we also have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues than most of the products set forth in the table above of these we also lost exclusivity in the us for caduet in 2011 and in the us and the eu for aromasin in 2011 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short period in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to overthecounter products 

  

our biotechnology products including enbrel and the prevnar family may face competition from biosimilars also referred to as “followon biologics” such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products already approved under the us public health service act abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and since the passage of the aca a framework for such approval exists in the us see government regulation and price constraints – biosimilars below specifically the aca provided innovator biologics with 12 years of exclusivity with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension after the exclusivity period expires the fda could approve biosimilar versions of innovator biologics the regulatory implementation of these provisions is ongoing and expected to take several years however the fda has begun to clarify its expectations for approval via the biosimilar pathway with the recent issuance of three draft guidance documents among other things these draft guidance documents confirm that the fda will allow biosimilar applicants to use a nonus licensed comparator in certain studies to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to a uslicensed reference product if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressures concomitantly a betterdefined biosimilars approval pathway will assist us in pursuing approval of our own biosimilar products in the us see item 1a risk factors – biotechnology products below 

in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years and in japan the regulatory authority has granted marketing authorizations for certain biosimilars including somatropin the recombinant human growth hormone in our genotropin product pursuant to a guideline for biosimilar approvals issued in 2009 if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and price reductions could follow expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could generally trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired 

we may face litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue likewise as we enter the biosimilars area and seek to launch products patents may be asserted against us 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2016 for leastdeveloped nations a number of countries have made improvements we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in other participant countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our human prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded drugs or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our acquisition of wyeth in october 2009 created a broader more diverse portfolio and pipeline with industryleading positions in potential highgrowth areas further strengthened by new capabilities in biotechnology and vaccines the addition of wyeth not only strengthened our presence in the united states and europe but also enhances our abilities to provide emerging markets in asia latin america africa the middle east and eastern europerussia with highquality innovative medicines 

  

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased drug companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and consumer healthcare manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases or indications as our major products 

such competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in research and development as well as our business development transactions over the past decade resulting in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also continue to enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs for instance our us primary care operations are structured into regional units in order to create a more flexible organization empowered to identify and address local market dynamics and customer needs we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

while our animal health business unit is the leading animal health company with market positions throughout the world many other companies offer competing products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include product innovation quality price service and effective promotion to veterinary professionals and livestock producers 

our consumer healthcare business unit faces competition from overthecounter business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies as well as retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources customer acceptance product quality our and our competitors’ introduction of new products ingredients claims dosage forms or other forms of innovation and pricing regulatory and legislative matters eg product labeling patient access prescription to overthecounter switches etc 

our nutrition business unit competes with multinational companies in the pharmaceutical and food industries as well as numerous smaller local and regional companies manufacturing infant nutrition products our competitive position is affected by several factors particularly the amount of resources deployed to develop enhance and promote products the rapid pace of product and packaging innovation in the category including scientific and technological advances overall product quality the effectiveness of our promotional efforts and product launch campaigns all of these factors drive brand recommendations from healthcare professionals and overall customer preference for our product brands 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 250 million people in the us now participate in some form of managed care 

  

because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos the marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations continues to grow in importance 

mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators health maintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing numbers of patients enrolled in mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances both their purchasing strength and importance to us 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures mcos typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers also mcos use their purchasing power and their ability to influence market share and volume of prescription drugs to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies which are selections of medicines available to members that are tiered according to copay amounts formularies are typically based on the prices and therapeutic benefits or a combination of the two of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mcoimplemented restriction can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to gain access to formularies for their products unique product features such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on most mco formularies 

the impact of mcos on drug prices and volumes has increased as a result of their role in negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit medicare part d which took effect january 1 2006 mcos and pbms negotiate on behalf of the federal government as prescription drug plans pdps we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products that are used by the senior population included on the formularies of the medicare pdps in 2011 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration generic competitors operate without large research and development expenses as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community all of which we are required to do in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the body equivalent to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less 

  

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary and pfizer injectables sell generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain competitors’ solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products respectively upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2011 and none are expected in 2012 however select materials have from time to time increased in price due to shortterm imbalances between supply and demand we have successfully secured the materials necessary to meet our requirements in these circumstances but generally at higher prices than those historically paid 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance in the us is the fda it has jurisdiction over our biopharmaceutical products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of these products the fda also regulates our consumer healthcare and animal health products the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some of our products 

in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission ftc which also has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products including overthecounter drugs and dietary supplements the department of justice doj and the sec individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various regulatory bodies see the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 17 commitments and contingencies in our 2011 financial report such actions may involve product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

healthcare reform in march 2010 the aca was enacted in the us the provisions of the aca are effective on various dates the principal provisions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry include 

 

  

  

  

   

 the aca is estimated to result in the coverage of 32 million previously uninsured individuals approximately half of this will occur through an expansion of the medicaid program effective in 2014 individuals with incomes below 133 of the federal poverty level fpl will be eligible for medicaid the remainder will be covered with private sector coverage either through their employers or new statebased health insurance exchanges with limited exceptions individuals who fail to purchase health insurance will pay a penalty individuals with incomes between 100400 of the fpl will be eligible for subsidies to help pay for coverage 

expanding insurance coverage and other costs are expected to represent a relatively modest gain to overall pharmaceutical sales as the newly insured are principally young and relatively healthy at the same time the rebates discounts taxes and other costs associated with the aca are a significant cost to the industry 

the aca created the independent payment advisory board ipab a 15member panel appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate the ipab is charged with developing proposals to “reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending” in the event that the actual medicare per capita growth rate exceeds a specified target unless congress acts to alter the proposals the proposals will be automatically implemented however the ipab cannot directly ration care raise premiums increase cost sharing or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility if the ipab fails to act the secretary of hhs is directed to prepare such proposals the ipab is prohibited by statute from making payment reductions to certain sectors such as hospitals and home health agencies which increases the risk that the ipab will propose to limit access to pharmaceutical treatments or mandate price controls for our products 

the aca also established the patient centered outcomes research institute pcori a federallyfunded private nonprofit corporation empowered to fund and disseminate comparative effectiveness research cer and build infrastructure for improved outcomes analysis pcori has no authority to impose formulary changes directly in governmentfunded health programs we expect that due to the pcori as well as the underlying market demand for datadriven differentiation cer studies will have growing influence on access overseeing and managing the pcori is an advisory board drawn from multiple and varied stakeholder organizations including the pharmaceutical industry pfizer’s chief medical officer currently serves as the industry representative on the advisory board 

the aca specifies certain benefits and services that must be covered for health insurers to qualify to participate in the state insurance exchanges prescription drugs are among these essential benefits in the law regulators are expected to provide guidance to states on the types of benefits and services that must be covered 

in 2012 the us supreme court is to review certain provisions of the aca including 1 the constitutionality of the aca’s individual mandate that requires most americans to buy health insurance starting in 2014 2 the “severability” of the individual mandate from the other provisions of the aca if the individual mandate is struck down 3 the aca’s medicaid expansion which would require each state to expand its program or lose all federal medicaid funds and 4 the applicability of a federal tax law the antiinjunction act to the lawsuits brought on the individual mandate which could bar review of that aca provision until at least 2014 the court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in late march and a decision is likely in june 

changes in marketing activity disclosure  the aca expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse including amendments to both the false claims act and the antikickback statute to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes the aca also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud with expanded subpoena power for hhs additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement 

  

starting in 2012 pharmaceutical manufacturers will be required to record any transfers of value made to doctors and teaching hospitals and to disclose such data to hhs with the initial disclosure to hhs due in 2013 in addition to civil penalties for failure to report transfers of value to physicians or teaching hospitals there will be criminal penalties if a manufacturer intentionally makes false statements in such reports further the increased access to such data by fraud and abuse investigators could potentially raise the risk of liability for improper payments under the false claims act pfizer already records and makes public these types of transfers and expects to be prepared to report the information in the format requested by hhs this national payment transparency effort and industry commitment to uphold voluntary codes of conduct the updated phrma code on interactions with healthcare professionals  phrma guiding principles direct to consumer advertisements about prescription medicines etc will complement existing laws and regulations to help ensure ethical collaboration and truthful product communications these efforts are in place to help ensure responsible marketing approaches and to address concerns 

medicare medicare part d went into effect on january 1 2006 elderly and disabled beneficiaries have access to the medicare drug benefit through private plans approved by the federal government beneficiaries with low incomes and modest assets are eligible for assistance with medicare part d plan premiums and cost sharing nationally the share of such beneficiaries with comprehensive drug coverage increased from 59 in 2005 to over 90 in 2010 medicare beneficiaries report high levels of satisfaction with an overwhelming majority saying the program works well in addition the program costs less than originally expected 

the aca made some important changes to the drug benefit—in particular phasing out the coverage gap by 2020 prior to the aca beneficiaries who reached a certain level of spending on prescription medications the medicare part d coverage gap or “doughnut hole” had to pay 100 of the cost of their drugs until personal outofpocket spending reached a level qualifying them for catastrophic coverage the medicare part d coverage gap discount program uses public and private funding to relieve the financial burden facing beneficiaries who fall into this coverage gap beginning in 2011 branded pharmaceutical companies paid 50 of the cost of the branded drugs in the gap and the government paid 7 of the cost of the generic drugs in the gap as a result rather than paying 100 of the total cost of their drugs when they reach the coverage gap enrollees paid 50 of the total cost of branded drugs and 93 of the total cost of generic drugs in 2012 the branded discount will remain 50 but the generic discount will increase to 14 by 2020 enrollees will pay only 25 of the cost of their branded and generic drugs in the gap as the share covered by the government will increase 

biosimilars the aca also created a framework for the approval of followon biologics or biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation which will require the fda to address such key topics as the type and extent of data needed to establish biosimilarity the data required to achieve interchangeability compared to biosimilarity the naming of biosimilars the implications of having or not having unique names the tracking and tracing of adverse events and the acceptability of data from an exus licensed reference product comparator to demonstrate biosimilarity andor interchangeability the fda has begun to address some of these issues with its recent release of three draft guidance documents specifically the fda has clarified that biosimilar applicants may use a nonus licensed comparator in certain studies to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to a uslicensed reference product 

pfizer is developing biosimilar medicines leveraging our expertise in biologics and our regulatory commercial and manufacturing strengths we will seek to provide highquality safe and effective biosimilars that provide patients and prescribers with additional treatment options and expand access by offering highquality more affordable alternatives for biologic medicines 

the budget proposal submitted to congress by president obama in february 2012 includes a provision that would reduce the base exclusivity period for a biologics product from 12 years to seven years there is no corresponding pending bill designed to amend the aca to alter the biologics provisions 

  

medicaid and related matters federal law requires branded pharmaceutical companies to provide rebates to state medicaid agencies the aca brought about major changes in the medicaid program collectively the measures i increased federal rebates paid by manufacturers on branded drugs within the traditional medicaid program from 151 to 231 and for generic drugs from 11 to 13 of average manufacturer price amp ii expanded medicaid drug rebates to cover drugs provided through managed medicaid plans and iii changed the rebate rates for line extensions or new formulations of solid oral dosage form drugs postimplementation of aca the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms withdrew its former detailed ampcalculation rules and new cms amp guidance is still pending publication now expected in 2012 the law also creates a federal upper limit under the medicaid program for generic drugs at 175 of amp in addition the law expanded the types of entities eligible for the “section 340b discounts” for outpatient drugs that began in 2010 

the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain medicines to medicaid beneficiaries restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states access in the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state given states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises a growing number of states are considering a variety of costcontrol strategies including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments 

the aca expands medicaid coverage in 2014 it is expected that 16 million additional people will be enrolled in medicaid by 2019 

we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the analysis of the consolidated statement of income – revenues – overview section of the mda in our 2011 financial report and in the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 1g significant accounting policies – revenues in our 2011 financial report which discussions are incorporated by reference 

pdufa reauthorization the prescription drug user fee act pdufa was first enacted in 1992 to provide the fda with additional resources to speed the review of important new medicines prior to pdufa inadequate funding of the fda drug review process led to a backlog of application reviews and lengthy review times pdufa revolutionized the review process for new drugs and biologics without compromising high approval standards for demonstration of product safety quality and efficacy pdufa sunsets every five years and must be reauthorized by congress pdufa iv will expire in september 2012 the proposed pdufa v reauthorization is the product of months of stakeholder discussion between the fda industry patient groups and consumers the pdufa v agreement focuses on three areas modernizing regulatory science review process enhancements and strengthening postmarket safety surveillance with the goal of supporting agency scientific capabilities and improving process efficiencies pfizer supports the pdufa v reauthorization in order to foster an innovationsupportive regulatory environment and to ensure that the fda is properly equipped to evaluate important new medicines in a timely and predictable fashion 

importation of drugs there continue to be legislative proposals to amend us law to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs from outside the us which can be sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to welldocumented safety concerns such as the increased risk of counterfeit products entering the supply chain such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us while the 2003 medicare modernization act 2003 mma maintains a prohibition on such imports it would allow importation from canada if the secretary of hhs certifies that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers before the 2003 mma federal law would have permitted importation of medicines into the us from a considerably larger group of developed countries provided the secretary of hhs made the same safety and costsavings certifications as part of the debate on the aca two senate proposals that would have restored the broader number of countries from which importation would be permissible were introduced but were ultimately defeated 

  

the secretaries of hhs in the clinton george w bush and obama administrations have all declined to certify that importation of medicines is safe and saves money if the secretary of hhs changes its position an increase in crossborder trade in medicines subject to foreign price controls in other countries could occur which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in december 2004 hhs and the department of commerce issued reports on drug importation and foreign price controls the hhs report noted that it would be “extraordinarily difficult to ensure that drugs personally imported by individual consumers” could meet the standards of safety that would support certifying such importation as safe while the report also concluded that the us could establish a feasible basis for commercial drug importation such a change in the law would require “new legal authorities substantial additional resources and significant restrictions on the types of drugs that could be imported” the report also noted that the total savings to be expected from such a commercial importation regime would be relatively small—1 or 2 of total drug spending in the us 

budget control act of 2011  in august 2011 the federal budget control act of 2011 the act was enacted in the us the act includes provisions to raise the us treasury department’s borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling and provisions to reduce the federal deficit by 24 trillion between 2012 and 2021 deficitreduction targets include 900 billion of discretionary spending reductions associated with hhs and various agencies charged with national security but those discretionary spending reductions do not include programs such as medicare and medicaid or direct changes to pharmaceutical pricing rebates or discounts a joint select committee of congress the committee was appointed to identify the remaining 15 trillion of deficit reductions by november 23 2011 but no recommendations were made by the committee prior to the deadline as a result the office of management and budget omb is now responsible for identifying the remaining 15 trillion of deficit reductions which will be divided evenly between defense and nondefense spending under this omb fallback review process social security medicaid veteran benefits and certain other spending categories are excluded from consideration but reductions in payments to medicare providers may be made although any such reductions are prohibited by law from exceeding 2 additionally certain payments to medicare part d plans such as lowincome subsidy payments are exempt from reduction while we do not know the specific nature of the spending reductions under the act that will affect medicare we do not expect that those reductions will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations however any significant spending reductions affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented andor any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us as part of any broader deficitreduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe canada and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

europe the approval of new drugs across the eu may be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissionema centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the european economic area countries norway and iceland the use of these procedures generally provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

since the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states we continue to work with individual countries on such matters across the region 

  

the world economy in 2011 faced renewed challenges as a result of recent financial conditions and in particular increased uncertainty around the solvency of governments as a result global growth has slowed one of the consequences of the economic downturn for almost all world economies has been an increase in public debt as a proportion of gross domestic product arising from increased government spending and reduced tax receipts for many developed economies particularly in europe this exacerbated existing fiscal imbalances and has created doubt in investment markets about the sustainability of public debt levels in a number of european countries further raising the cost of borrowing with the result that financial support from the eu and the international monetary fund has been necessary in the cases of greece portugal and ireland stringent austerity measures have been implemented in most european countries with the aim of closing the fiscal gap in particular in spain and italy 

under these macroeconomic conditions pfizer continues to face widespread downward pressures on international pricing and reimbursement particularly in developed european markets with a large government share of pharmaceutical spending specific pricing pressures in 2011 included measures to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure in italy spain greece ireland and portugal 

formal processes of international reference pricing irp between eu countries add to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries price variations have also arisen from exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and other european currencies and these are also exacerbated by international reference pricing systems the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to intensify as a result of reforms to irp policies emergency measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries and ongoing exchange rate turbulence 

on january 26 2007 the new eu regulation on medicines for pediatric use became effective this introduced new obligations on pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on their medicines for children and subject to various conditions offered the possibility of incentives for so doing including exclusivity extensions the aim of this regulation is to improve the health of children in the eu through high quality research stimulating the development of new medicines creating infrastructure to enable authorized use and improving the information on medicines for children a pediatric committee pdco was created within the ema to provide scientific opinions and input on development plans for medicines for use with children in line with this regulation pfizer is conducting many pediatric research programs for its inline and development products and completed its first emaapproved pediatric investigation plan for lipitor  in 2009 

on december 31 2010 the eu published new pharmacovigilance legislation which had been adopted by the council and parliament of the eu the legislation is required to be implemented by mid2012 and entails many new and revised requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance as well as the codification of various existing requirements previously set out in guidance key changes include the possibility for regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization efficacy studies both at the time of approval and at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional requirements to include statements in product labeling with regard to adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products there also is expected to be significantly greater transparency of the safety review process 

the new legislation forms part of a threepart “pharmaceutical package” to amend the existing eu pharmaceutical legislation the second part adopted on may 27 2011 is a directive aimed at preventing falsified medicines from entering into the legal supply chain notably the directive imposes new obligations on all parties in the distribution chain including importers traders manufacturers distributors and any operator who repackages a product this is required to be implemented by january 2013 the third part of the package concerns the provision of information on prescription medicines to patients which has reached a reasonably advanced stage but has proved controversial to date and the outcome for which is more uncertain 

at the end of the third quarter of 2010 the commissioner for industry and entrepreneurship of the european commission announced the launch of a process on corporate responsibility in the pharmaceutical 

  

industry the impact of which is yet to be determined through ongoing working committees the process includes three independent platforms i transparency and ethics in the sector ii access to medicines in africa and iii access to medicines in europe in the context of pricing and reimbursement the platform on access to medicines in europe will focus on enhancing collaboration among eu member states and relevant stakeholders in order to find common nonregulatory approaches to ensure “timely and equitable access to medicines” 

canada  health canada hc is the government agency that provides regulatory and marketing approval for drugs and therapeutic products in canada the upcoming legislative and regulatory modernization lrm is the most significant drug regulatory system reform in canada in over 50 years and is expected to overhaul canada’s food and drugs act and regulations the lrm supports a ‘lifecycle’ regulatory approach and is focused on strengthening evidencebased decision making good regulatory planning licensing postlicensing accountability authority and enforcement through this framework hc intends to improve the market authorization process and implement necessary regulatory frameworks in october 2010 hc accelerated its modernization efforts this included the proposed regulatory pathways for orphan drugs harmonized with useu regulations and for biosimilars referred to as “subsequent entry biologics” sebs this would formalize into regulations hc’s guidance document which provided for approval of sebs in 2009 furthermore lrm is to entail increased regulatory oversight throughout the drug lifecycle to continually assess the benefitrisk balance following an extensive technical consultation process hc intends to propose a first set of regulatory amendments around the third quarter of 2012 the whole lrm process is expected to take place over a period of three years 

introductory “nonexcessive” prices and price increases are controlled by the federal patented medicines prices review board however reimbursement is under provincial jurisdiction as provinces continue to face budget pressure from growing healthcare expenditures many provincial governments have developed pricing and purchasing strategies including product listing agreements and a pancanadian purchasing alliance initiative to obtain better drug prices the private sector is also attempting to exert its negotiating power on drug manufacturers the 2004 federalprovincialterritorial fpt health accord that sets out the canada health transfers payment to provinces plus commitments on health policy initiatives expires on march 31 2014 renegotiation will be influenced by the challenging fiscal positions of all fpt governments which could increase hurdles for access to newer innovative therapies 

canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs which provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity can be further enhanced to encourage innovation through the canadaeu comprehensive economic  trade agreement the federal government also has jurisdiction over international trade and therefore over the issue of crossborder trade in pharmaceuticals and internet pharmacies 

asia the regulatory environment in asia presents multiple issues for companies trying to achieve simultaneous global development and registration ie marketing products at the same time as in the us europe canada and elsewhere while each country in asia has its unique regulatory concerns there are a number of regulatory issues that are common among the majority of countries in asia for example with the exception of japan health authorities in asia generally require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority eg the us fda before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval proof of reference country approval is usually satisfied by submitting a certificate of pharmaceutical product a legal document that is issued by the competent health authority certifying that the company’s product has satisfied its country’s registration requirements and manufacturing standards often this requirement delays marketing authorization in asia by 1215 months following market authorization in the us and europe 

another common regulatory issue in asia is the requirement for local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval each of japan china korea taiwan and india has regulations in some form that require clinical studies in the country eg china requires a prescribed number of chinese patients regardless of the product therapeutic area or disease population although some agencies have 

  

shown flexibility based on scientific rationale related to ethnicity assessments it is not uncommon for companies to be required to duplicate costly clinical trials in asia pursuant to these regulations this can further add to marketing approval delays compared to the us and europe 

in japan the government is aiming to reduce the drug lag ie drugs are launched in japan years after the eu and us markets in a twopronged approach reducing regulatory agency review times and establishing a new pilot pricing premium the pilot pricing premium provides a financial incentive for drug development in japan while economic conditions and government debt levels continue to put pressure on healthcare costs resulting in cost containment particularly in the offpatent sector the recent extension of the pilot pricing premium for innovative products is encouraging 

in korea the national health insurance deficit prompted the government to make significant price cuts in the offpatent sector at the end of 2011 we continue to work with a committee established by the government to improve the pricing system for innovative new drugs 

the controlling regulatory agency in china is the state food and drug administration sfda sfda’s scope of responsibilities is similar to that of the fda or ema two key agencies within sfda are the center for drug evaluation cde and the national institute for the control of pharmaceutical and biological products nicpbp the cde which is analogous to the fda’s center for drug evaluation and research is primarily responsible for the technical review of product applications including clinical trial applications and new drug applications and drafting technical guidance documents nicpbp is the quality testing arm of sfda legally responsible for the testing of pharmaceuticals biologics and medical devices nationwide 

china’s regulatory system is unique in many ways and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with international standards as a result it is not uncommon to see treatments entering the market in china two to four years after first marketing in the us and europe 

intellectual property  while the global intellectual property environment has improved following wtotrips our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in emerging market countries in particular governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines as well as to protect their national pharmaceutical industries there is considerable political pressure to weaken existing intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which has led to policies such as higher standards and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions eg new medical treatment methods and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers 

in china the intellectual property environment has improved although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with world trade organization wto provisions and several companies including pfizer have established research and development centers in china due to increased confidence in china’s intellectual property environment despite this china remained on the us department of commerce priority watch list for 2011 a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years but enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent such as the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage 

additionally true regulatory data protection remains elusive in china the center for drug evaluation provides protection against reliance on data by generic applicants for a fixed period of time following its wto accession in 2001 china revised its laws to incorporate concepts from the wtotrips and china’s relevant laws establish a sixyear period of protection against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test and other data of products containing a new chemical ingredient however the current regulations are ambiguous as to how data protection is implemented in practice in china for example certain key concepts such as “new chemical ingredient” and “unfair commercial use” are undefined 

  

in brazil and other latin american countries backlogs at patent agencies have presented challenges for the protection of certain products the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions such as new medical uses of drug products may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products 

in india limited standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to protect many of our inventions india and other countries such as israel maintain a system of pregrant patent oppositions that delay the granting of patents and add an additional challenge in our ability to protect our products through patents 

in korea the laws and regulations for the patentregulatory approval linkage system have now been finalized and we are waiting for the effective date of implementation as part of the united stateskorea free trade agreement the korean patentregulatory approval linkage system includes biologics 

environmental law compliance 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 17 commitments and contingencies in our 2011 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2011 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

  

 while we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with pending and potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change we have no reason to believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

we have reviewed the potential for physical risks to our facilities and supply chain that may be exacerbated by climate change and have concluded that because of our facility locations and our existing distribution networks we do not believe these risks are material in the near term

us healthcare reformhealthcare legislation 

as mentioned above the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and its provisions are effective on various dates we expect that the rebates discounts taxes and other costs over time will have a significant effect on our expenses and profitability in the future see the discussion under the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook – our operating environment – us healthcare legislation section of the mda in our 2011 financial report and in item 1 business under the caption government regulation and price constraints  furthermore the ipab created by the aca to reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending could potentially limit access to certain treatments or mandate price controls for our products moreover expanded government investigative authority may increase the costs of compliance with new regulations and programs we also face the uncertainties that might result from any modification repeal or invalidation of any of the provisions of the aca 

  

pricing pressures government regulation and managed care trends 

us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies in the us many of our biopharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures have increased as a result of the 2003 mma due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in addition if the 2003 mma or the aca were amended to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions it would have a significant adverse impact on our business furthermore mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaideligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 

the prohibition on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of erectile dysfunction medications by the medicaid program which became effective january 1 2006 and the similar federal funding prohibition for the medicare part d program which became effective january 1 2007 has had an adverse effect on our business any prohibitions on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of other classes of drugs in the future may also have an adverse effect 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for governmentsponsored healthcare systems in particular there were governmentmandated price reductions for certain biopharmaceutical products in certain european and emerging market countries in 2011 and we anticipate continuing pricing pressures in europe and emerging markets in 2012 this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions failure to obtain governmentapproved pricing or formulary placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccines business we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business 

mcos and other private insurers frequently adopt their own payment or reimbursement reductions consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of these entities private thirdparty payers as well as governments increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion private health insurance companies and selfinsured employers have been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring that patient treatment first fail on a generic product before permitting access to a branded medicine as the us payer market concentrates further and more drugs become available in generic form biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payers who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives 

  

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us around the world upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period which can adversely affect our business 

also the patents covering several of our medicines including lipitor  viagra  detroldetrol la  lyrica  sutent  tygacil  rapamune  zyvox  avinza  epipen  torisel and embeda are being challenged by generic manufacturers in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with ours including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

dependence on key inline products 

we recorded direct product revenues of more than 1 billion for each of 12 biopharmaceutical products in 2011 lipitor  lyrica  prevnar 13prevenar 13  enbrel  celebrex  viagra  norvasc  zyvox  xalatanxalacom  sutent  geodonzeldox and the premarin family those products accounted for 56 of our total biopharmaceutical revenues in 2011 lipitor sales in 2011 were approximately 96 billion accounting for approximately 14 of our total 2011 revenues among other losses of exclusivity for lipitor  we lost exclusivity for lipitor in the us on november 30 2011 and lipitor will have lost exclusivity in the majority of european markets by may 2012 as a result we expect that our revenues for lipitor in 2012 will be substantially less than our 2011 revenues for lipitor  if the products referenced above or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant as noted patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years including some of our billiondollar products such as lipitor as discussed above xalatan in the us in march 2011 and xalatanxalacom in 15 major european markets in january 2012 and geodon in the us in march 2012 and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that have smaller patient populations such as certain types of cancer and multiple sclerosis the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products is beginning to generate significant payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector while the impact on us of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has been limited to date our growing portfolio of specialty products combined with the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world and the deteriorating finances of governments may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future 

  

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of safe effective new products and the development of additional uses for existing products are very important to our success our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers either through internal research and development or through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

additionally our research and development investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets and failure to invest in the right technology platforms therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities in order to deliver a more robust pipeline could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline additionally even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the science may not work for any given program despite the significant investment required for research and development 

we recently announced a focus on fewer disease areas where we believe we can deliver the greatest medical and commercial success as well as the implementation of our rd footprint reduction by moving forward on our productivity initiatives as a result of these actions we expect significant reductions in our annual research and development expenses which are reflected in our 2012 financial guidance there can be no assurance that this strategy will deliver the desired result in the targeted timeframe or at all which could affect profitability in the future 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

risks and uncertainties apply particularly with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products as examples there is no assurance that our late stage pipeline products such as tofacitinib bosutinib and eliquis apixaban for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation will receive regulatory approval andor be commercially successful or that recently approved products such as prevnar 13prevenar 13 for use in adults 50 years of age and older xalkori crizotinib and inlyta axitinib will be approved in other markets andor be commercially successful there is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings should they occur 

there are many considerations that can affect marketing of our products around the world regulatory delays delays in or the inability to successfully complete or adequately design and implement clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that can adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements further claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in a negative impact on product sales product recalls or withdrawals andor consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claims also increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the riskbenefit profile of products as they relate to alreadyapproved products has resulted in a more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for among other things additional clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased postapproval requirements such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies see postapproval data below 

  

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase iv trials could result in loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 the fdaaa gives the fda enhanced postmarket authority including the explicit authority to require postmarket studies and clinical trials labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with fdaapproved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies the fda’s exercise of its authority under the fdaaa could result in delays or increased costs during product development clinical trials and regulatory review increased costs to comply with additional postapproval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable costs postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect sales of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate or are perceived to implicate an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of the affected products accordingly new data about our products or products similar to our products could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal or recall furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of our products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of our products 

patent protection 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies our currently pending or future patent applications andor extensions may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have their own patent laws some of which create legal uncertainty or unpredictability with respect to the requirements and standards for patent protection our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain sovereigns may engage in compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as a result of local political pressure in addition mechanisms exist in much of the world permitting some form of challenge by generic drug marketers to our patents prior to or immediately following the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights 

our business also may rely on unpatented proprietary technology knowhow and trade secrets if the confidentiality of this intellectual property is breached it could adversely impact our business 

biotechnology products 

the aca has created a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the us following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential sixmonth pediatric extension such biosimilars could reference biotechnology products already approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a biosimilar recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin  which was approved under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general 

  

and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years and in japan the regulatory authority has granted marketing authorizations for certain biosimilars including somatropin the recombinant human growth hormone in our genotropin product pursuant to a guideline for biosimilar approvals issued in 2009 if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could generally trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired we may face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue 

pfizer is developing biosimilar medicines the developing pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products in the us could diminish the value of investments in biosimilars that pfizer has made and may continue to make going forward other risks include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity coupled with high costs associated with clinical development secondary patents or intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization and lower prescriptions of biosimilars due to concerns over protein comparability over innovator medicines 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing and payer reimbursement process but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results 

foreign exchange and interest rate risk 

significant portions of our revenues and earnings as well as our substantial international net assets are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 60 of our total 2011 revenues were derived from international operations including 27 from the europe region and 20 from the japan and the rest of asia region as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro the uk pound the japanese yen the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses if the us dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency our revenues will increase having a positive impact and our overall expenses will increase having a negative impact on net income likewise if the us dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency our revenues will decrease having a negative impact and our overall expenses will decrease having a positive impact on net income therefore significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance 

in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the financial risk management section of the mda in our 2011 financial report for additional details see the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 7e financial instruments – derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2011 financial report those sections of our 2011 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations also could be affected by capital and exchange controls expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations 

  

and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of the world’s largest markets leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s global performance as a result we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets however there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that these countries will continue to sustain these growth rates in addition some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending which as discussed above can adversely affect our results 

animal health 

our animal health unit may be impacted by challenging global economic conditions resulting in high unemployment rates and tight credit conditions a high unemployment rate typically results in reduced traffic in veterinary clinics negatively impacting our companion animal business tight credit conditions limit the borrowing power of livestock producers causing some to switch to lowerpriced alternatives see global economic conditions below 

pfizer nutrition 

pfizer nutrition may be impacted by challenging global economic conditions and the resulting effect on consumer spending both in developed and emerging markets the nutrition business may also experience significant financial impact associated with changes in national regional and international laws rules and guidelines and their enforcement our infant and young child nutrition products are subject to an array of rules and regulations enforced by local government entities as well as treaties conventions and guidelines from international authorities changes to these requirements can significantly impact costs relating to taxes tariffs trade labeling marketing manufacturing and the overall availability of our products see global economic conditions below 

consumer healthcare 

the consumer healthcare unit may be impacted by economic volatility and generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal andor reformulation of certain products eg coughcold products see global economic conditions below 

global economic conditions 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the us and europe affecting the performance of products such as lipitor  celebrex and lyrica  we believe that patients experiencing the effects of the challenging economic environment including high unemployment levels and increases in copays sometimes switch to generic products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments to reduce their costs challenging economic conditions in the us also have increased the number of patients in the medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and in many states to formulary restrictions limiting access to brandname drugs including ours in addition we experienced continued pricing pressure in various economic environments around the world including in europe and in a number of emerging markets resulting in governmentmandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products as well as governmentimposed access restrictions in certain countries 

  

the global economic downturn and the challenging global economic environment have not had nor do we anticipate they will have a material impact on our liquidity due to our significant operating cash flows financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as market conditions change we continue to monitor our liquidity position however there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions 

other potential impacts of these challenging economic conditions include declining sales increased costs changes in foreign exchange rates a decline in the value of or a lower rate of return on our financial assets and pension plan investments which may require us to increase our pension funding obligations adverse government actions delays or failures in the performance of customers suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 

outsourcing 

outsourcing to third parties in areas including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial execution nonclinical research safety services and other areas could expose us to suboptimal quality missed deadlines supply disruptions noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for our results for example we are transitioning our clinical trial execution model from multiple functional service providers to two strategic partners any issues with one or both of these partners or during the transition could adversely impact our business 

interactions with healthcare professionals 

risks and uncertainties apply where we provide something of value to a healthcare professional andor government official which if found to be improper could potentially result in government enforcement actions and penalties these risks may increase as nonus jurisdictions adopt new antibribery laws and regulations 

difficulties of our wholesale distributors 

in 2011 our largest wholesale distributor accounted for approximately 13 of our total revenue and 30 of our total us revenue and our top three wholesale distributors accounted for approximately 32 of our total revenue and 77 of our total us revenue if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions shutdowns approval delays withdrawals recalls penalties supply disruptions or shortages reputational harm product liability unanticipated costs or otherwise examples of such difficulties or delays include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected or that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network andor comply with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulations 

counterfeit products 

a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which 

  

appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and often unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business by among other things causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines 

cost and expense controlunusual eventsintangible assets and goodwill 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to successfully implement our plans announced february 1 2011 regarding our research and development function see research and development investment above as well as our ability to realize the projected benefits of our costreduction and productivity initiatives including those related to our research and development function 

in addition our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets including goodwill for iprd assets the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty that these assets will ultimately yield successful products the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon among other things regulatory approvals and market acceptance as such we expect that many of these iprd assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future 

further as discussed above in item 1 business under the caption operating segments  pfizer used to report all of its biopharmaceutical businesses in a single segment biopharmaceutical and now reports these businesses in three operating segments primary care specialty care and oncology and emerging markets and established products as a result of this change the goodwill previously associated with the single biopharmaceutical operating segment has been allocated among the three new biopharmaceutical operating segments while all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to impairments such as among other things unanticipated competition an adverse action or assessment by a regulator a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate andor a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity in general our increased number of biopharmaceutical reporting units significantly increases our risk of goodwill impairment charges as smaller reporting units are inherently less able to absorb negative developments that might affect certain operating assets but not others 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities antitrust environmental employment and tax litigations and claims government investigations and 

  

other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid or accrued 

our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid drug rebate program the us foreign corrupt practices act and other federal and state statutes including antikickback and false claims laws as well as similar laws in foreign jurisdictions like many companies in our industry we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities as well as by consumers and private payers in some instances we have incurred significant expense and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims actions and inquiries for example these claims actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation 

patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through acquisitions licensing and alliances see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook – our business development initiatives section of the mda in our 2011 financial report which is incorporated by reference however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities and competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify and execute transactions 

information technology 

we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to service interruption malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy or security breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems including in some cases thirdparty service providers to which we may outsource certain business functions may pose a risk that sensitive data including intellectual property or personal information may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or identify breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive information which could result in financial legal business or reputational harm to us 

failure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitions 

our future results may be affected by i the impact of and our ability to successfully execute any strategic alternatives we decide to pursue for our animal health and nutrition businesses as well as any other corporate strategic initiatives we may pursue in the future and ii our ability to realize the projected benefits of our acquisition of king pharmaceuticals inc as well as any other acquisitions we may pursue in the future

comparative segment information for 2010 2009 and 2008 is presented in the tables captioned segment revenues and profit segment assets property plant and equipment additions and depreciation and amortization geographic and revenues by product in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and revenue information in our 2010 financial report the information from those tables in our 2010 financial report is incorporated by reference in this 2010 form 10k 

our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate in the us the principal authority regulating our operations is the food and drug administration fda the fda regulates the safety and efficacy of the products we offer and our research quality manufacturing processes product promotion advertising and 

product labeling similar regulations exist in most other countries and in many countries the government also regulates our prices see government regulation and price constraints below 

biopharmaceutical 

revenues from the biopharmaceutical segment contributed approximately 86 of our total revenues in 2010 and 91 of our total revenues in both 2009 and 2008 

we recorded direct product sales of more than 1 billion for each of 15 biopharmaceutical products in 2010 and for each of nine legacy pfizer biopharmaceutical products in 2009 and 2008 these products represented 60 of our biopharmaceutical revenues in 2010 56 of our biopharmaceutical revenues in 2009 and 60 of our biopharmaceutical revenues in 2008 

worldwide biopharmaceutical revenues in 2010 were 585 billion an increase of 29 compared to 2009 primarily due to the inclusion of operational revenues from legacy wyeth products of approximately 137 billion which favorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by 30 the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies primarily the canadian dollar australian dollar japanese yen and brazilian real which favorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by approximately 900 million or 2 partially offset by the decrease in operational revenues of approximately 15 billion or 3 from legacy pfizer products overall including norvasc  camptosar  lipitor and detroldetrol la in 2010 

geographically in the us biopharmaceutical revenues increased 30 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from legacy wyeth products of 66 billion which had a favorable impact of 33 partially offset by lower overall revenues from legacy pfizer products including lipitor  detroldetrol la  celebrex lyrica chantix and caduet  and the impact of increased rebates in 2010 as a result of the impact of the us healthcare legislation enacted in march 2010 all of which had an unfavorable impact of 664 million or 3 

 

  

in our international markets biopharmaceutical revenues increased 28 in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting the inclusion of operational revenues from legacy wyeth products of 71 billion which had a favorable impact of 28 and the favorable impact of foreign exchange on international biopharmaceutical revenues of approximately 900 million or 3 partially offset by lower operational revenues from legacy pfizer products of 819 million or 3 the decrease in operational revenues of legacy pfizer products was due to lower operational revenues from among other products lipitor  norvasc and camptosar  all of which were impacted by the loss of exclusivity in certain international markets

 diversified 

worldwide diversified revenues increased 114 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the inclusion of operational revenues from legacy wyeth products of approximately 44 billion in 2010 which favorably impacted diversified revenues by 106 the increase was primarily due to the addition of the legacy wyeth consumer healthcare and nutrition operations in addition worldwide diversified revenues were favorably impacted by the operational revenue increase in legacy pfizer diversified businesses of 3 in 2010 and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 5 

animal health 

our animal health unit is one of the largest in the world we discover develop and sell products for the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock and companion animals revenues from animal health products increased by 29 in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting the inclusion of operational revenues from legacy wyeth animal health products of 22 higher operational revenues from legacy pfizer animal health products of 4 due primarily to growth in the companion animal and livestock business and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 3 the following factors impacted 2010 results 

 

  

 among the products we market are vaccines antiinfectives antiinflammatories antiemetics and parasiticides including the following products 

 

  



 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 consumer healthcare 

consumer healthcare is the fifthlargest overthecounter healthcare products company in the world and sells two of the ten largest selling overthecounter brands  centrum and advil  in the world consumer healthcare revenues totaled 28 billion for 2010 the consumer healthcare unit holds strong positions in various geographic markets with its highest revenue volume in the us canada the people’s republic of china italy germany brazil and australia major categories and product lines include 

 

  



  

 nutrition 

pfizer nutrition is a leader in infant nutritionals in the markets in which we operate we have a focused presence in key markets throughout asia the middle east europe and latin america with china the philippines the uk mexico and australia being among our top markets as part of pfizer nutrition continues to have enhanced opportunities to grow in new and existing markets as well as to leverage the company’s strengths in order to accelerate innovation and develop new products nutrition’s revenues totaled 19 billion in 2010 

nutrition products include our s26 preterm feeding system  specialty formulas such as s26 pe gold s26 ha gold and a range of agespecific products that include s26 pe gold progress  promil and promise 

capsugel 

capsugel has a diverse product line that includes not only hard gelatin capsules but also liquid softgel nonanimal and fish gelatin capsules all for use in pharmaceutical and dietary supplement dosage delivery revenues of 752 million for 2010 represent an increase of 12 million versus 2009 with no meaningful impact from foreign exchange revenue in the 2009 period prior to the acquisition of wyeth includes 5 million of capsugel sales to wyeth postacquisition these sales are considered intercompany and eliminated from consolidated pfizer results we are currently reviewing strategic alternatives for capsugel which may include divestiture 

research and development 

innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs we spent 94 billion in 2010 78 billion in 2009 and 79 billion in 2008 on research and development 

 

  

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through acquisition licensing or other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable according to the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma out of 500010000 screened compounds only 250 enter preclinical testing five enter human clinical trials and one is approved by the fda the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

as of yearend 2010 we had about 374 projects in research and development ranging from discovery through registration of which 116 programs are in phase 1 through registration at yearend 2010 our phase iii portfolio contained 24 programs while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments in our 2010 financial report that information is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product obsolescence 

on february 1 2011 we announced a focus on disease areas where we believe we can deliver the greatest medical and commercial success our highpriority therapeutic areas are immunology and inflammation oncology cardiovascular and metabolic diseases neuroscience and pain and vaccines key steps in this process include the planned reduction in the number of disease areas we will focus on as well as a realigned research and development footprint as a result we expect significant reductions in our annual research and development expenses 

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same segments as our us operations—biopharmaceutical and diversified 

revenues from operations outside the us of 388 billion accounted for 57 of our total revenues in 2010 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 18 countries outside the us in 2010 the us was the only country to contribute more than 10 of our total revenues comprising 43 of total revenues in both 2010 and 2009 and 423 of total revenues in 2008 japan is our secondlargest national market with 75 of total revenues in 2010 85 of total revenues in 2009 and 77 of total revenues in 2008 

for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues see the table captioned geographic in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and revenue information in our 2010 financial report and the table captioned revenues by segment and geographic area in our 2010 financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws and regulations on pricing reimbursement and access to our products see government regulation and price constraints below for a discussion of these matters 

 

  

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2010 both revenues and net income were favorably impacted by foreign exchange in general as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar increased our revenues and net income in many countries while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments see the discussion under note 9e to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2010 financial report that discussion is incorporated by reference related information about valuation and risks associated with such financial instruments in part f of that note is also incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical segment we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos employers and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

in january 2009 we announced the creation of customerfocused units within our biopharmaceutical segment to better meet the diverse needs of physicians patients and our customers while maximizing value for our company and our shareholders 

the biopharmaceutical segment includes five human health customerfocused units primary care specialty care oncology established products and emerging markets upon the closing of the wyeth 

acquisition on october 15 2009 our specialty care customerfocused unit expanded to include vaccines 

in april 2009 in the us we also restructured into regional units in order to create a more flexible organization empowered to identify and address local market dynamics and customer needs our structure aligns the sales marketing and medical functions to work closely to meet the needs of key customer segments while ensuring common coordination focus and accountability across the organizations 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies we seek to gain access to healthcare authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended approved andor reimbursed medicines and other products we also work with mcos pbms employers and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

during 2010 pfizer revenues generated from our three largest biopharmaceutical wholesalers were as follows 

 

  

  

 sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the biopharmaceutical segment apart from these instances neither of our business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers 

our global diversified segment consists of four global units animal health consumer healthcare nutrition and capsugel each unit utilizes its own sales and marketing organization to promote its products and each occasionally uses distributors in smaller markets 

our animal health unit’s advertising and promotions are generally targeted to healthcare professionals animal health products are sold through veterinarians distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users 

 

  

our consumer healthcare unit’s advertising and promotions are generally targeted to consumers through television print and other media advertising as well as through instore promotion consumer healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies retail chains and grocery and convenience stores 

our nutrition unit supports and adheres to the world health organization code and national codes on the marketing of breast milk substitutes nutrition encourages breastfeeding as the best nutrition for infants and provides important products for infants who are not exclusively breastfed advertising and promotion of our nutrition products for older children and adults generally target consumers and healthcare professionals through print and media advertising and television our nutrition products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies hospitals and modern and traditional retailers 

patents and intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current 

product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period are those for the drugs set forth in the table below 

 

 in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

aricept is patented by eisai co ltd eisai we copromote aricept with eisai in the us and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug in certain other countries we lost exclusivity for aricept 5 mg and 10 mg tablets in the us in november 2010 we expect that the aricept 23mg tablet will have exclusivity in the us until july 2013 

we have exclusive rights to enbrel outside the us and canada and we copromote enbrel with amgen in the us and canada 

in addition to our us basic product patent for lipitor which including the pediatric exclusivity 

  

period expired in march 2010 we have a patent covering specifically the enantiomeric form of the drug which including the pediatric exclusivity period expires in june 2011 we have granted watson laboratories inc watson the exclusive right to sell the authorized generic version of lipitor in the us for a period of five years which is expected to commence in november 2011 as watson’s exclusive supplier we will manufacture and sell generic atorvastatin tablets to watson in markets outside the us lipitor has lost exclusivity in certain countries and will lose exclusivity at various times in other countries the lipitor compound patent will expire in november 2011 however we are pursuing a pediatric extension in the european union eu if successful this exclusivity in the majority of major european markets will be extended by six months to may 2012 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2010 financial report regarding pending legal challenges to our lipitor patents in the us 

norvasc effexoreffexor xr  vfend tablets zosyntazocin and protonix face generic competition in the us 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor caduet viagra  detroldetrol la lyrica  tygacil sutent  rapamune  relpax and zyvox  wyeth and a subsidiary of wyeth are defendants in a lawsuit alleging that their refacto and xyntha products infringe the patents of another company 

we also have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues than most of the products set forth in the table above of these we expect to lose exclusivity in the us for caduet and aromasin in 2011 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short period in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical 

manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to overthecounter products 

our biotechnology products including enbrel and the prevnar family may face competition from biosimilars also referred to as “followon biologics” such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products already approved under the us public health service act abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and now with the passage of legislation in 2010 a framework for such approval exists in the us se e government regulation and price constraints below 

in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could generally trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired 

we expect that we may face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2016 for leastdeveloped nations a number of countries have made improvements we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in other participant countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement 

 

  

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our human prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded drugs or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our acquisition of wyeth in october 2009 created a broader more diverse portfolio and pipeline with industryleading positions in potential highgrowth areas further strengthened by new capabilities in biotechnology and vaccines the addition of wyeth not only strengthens our presence in the united states and europe but also enhances our abilities to provide emerging markets in china latin america africa and the middle east with highquality innovative medicines 

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased drug companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and consumer healthcare manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases or indications as our major products 

such competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in research and development as well as our emphasis on business development over the past decade all resulting in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by ensuring that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also continue to enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical 

functions including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs for instance we restructured into regional units in order to create a more flexible organization empowered to identify and address local market dynamics and customer needs we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

while our animal health unit is one of the largest in the world many other companies offer competing products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include product innovation quality price service and effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers 

our consumer healthcare unit faces competition from overthecounter business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies as well as retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources customer acceptance product quality our and our competitors’ introduction of new products ingredients claims dosage forms or other forms of innovation pricing and regulatory and legislative matters eg product labeling patient access prescription to overthecounter switches etc 

our nutrition unit has many competitors including several multinational companies as well as numerous local privatelyowned brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including the amount of resources deployed by 

  

competitors to develop enhance and promote products the increasing pace of product and packaging innovation in the category the effectiveness of our promotional efforts customer acceptance product quality new product launches development of alternative products by competitors growth of lowercost private label brands regulatory and legislative issues and scientific and technological advances 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 250 million people in the us now participate in some version of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos the marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations continues to grow in importance 

mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators health maintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing numbers of patients enrolled in mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers mcos use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the 

available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other restrictions such as requiring prior authorizations can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on most mco formularies 

the impact of mcos on drug prices and volumes has increased as the result of their role in negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit medicare part d that took effect january 1 2006 mcos and pbms negotiate on behalf of the federal government as prescription drug plans pdps we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products that are used by the senior population included on the formularies of the medicare pdps in 2010 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiry generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about our products to the medical community in addition the fda approval 

 

  

process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary sells generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain of our competitors’ pharmaceutical products upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2010 and none are expected in 2011 however select agriculturalbased materials have from time to time increased in price due to shortterm imbalances between supply and demand we have successfully secured these materials to meet our requirements in these circumstances but generally at higher prices than those historically paid 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance is the fda in the us it has jurisdiction over our biopharmaceutical products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of these products the fda also regulates our consumer healthcare nutrition and capsugel products as well as our animal health products the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some of our products 

in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission which also has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products including overthecounter drugs and dietary supplements and the department of justice individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various regulatory bodies see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2010 financial report such actions may involve product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

healthcare reform in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act commonly referred to as the affordable care act aca was enacted in the us the provisions of the aca are effective on various dates over the next several years the principal provisions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry include 

 



 

  

  

 the aca is estimated to result in the coverage of 32 million uninsured individuals approximately half of this will occur through an expansion of the medicaid program effective in 2014 individuals with incomes below 133 of the federal poverty level fpl will be eligible for medicaid the remainder will be covered with private sector coverage either through their employer or the new statebased health insurance exchanges with limited exceptions individuals who fail to purchase health insurance will pay a penalty individuals with incomes between 100—400 of fpl will be eligible for subsidies to help pay for coverage 

expanding insurance coverage and other costs are expected to represent a relatively modest gain to overall pharmaceutical sales as the newly insured are principally young and relatively healthy at the same time the rebates discounts taxes and other costs associated with the aca are a significant cost to the industry 

the aca created the independent payment advisory board ipab a 15member panel appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate the ipab is charged with developing proposals to “reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending” in the event that the actual medicare per capita growth rate exceeds a specified target unless congress acts to alter the proposals they will be automatically implemented the ipab cannot directly ration care raise premiums increase cost sharing or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility if it fails to act the secretary of hhs is directed to prepare a proposal the ipab is prohibited by statute from making payment reductions to certain sectors such as hospitals and home health agencies which increases the risk that the ipab will propose to limit access to pharmaceutical treatments or mandate price controls for our products 

the aca also establishes a patient centered outcomes research institute pcori a private nonprofit corporation empowered to fund and disseminate comparative effectiveness research cer and build infrastructure for improved outcomes analysis pcori will have no ability to impose formulary changes directly in governmentfunded health programs we expect that due to the pcori as well as the underlying market demand for datadriven differentiation cer studies will have growing influence on access overseeing and managing the pcori is an advisory board drawn from multiple and varied stakeholder organizations including the pharmaceutical industry pfizer’s chief medical officer currently serves as the industry representative on the advisory board 

the aca defines a set of essential benefits that must be covered for health benefits to qualify to meet the requirements of the aca mandates prescription drugs are defined as an essential benefit in the legislation regulation may offer additional specificity on what exactly should be covered for example that branded drugs and generics should be covered essential benefits are defined to be comparable to current employer plans 

changes in the enforcement environment  the aca expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse including amendments to both the false claims act and the antikickback statute to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes the aca also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud with expanded subpoena power for hhs additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement 

starting in 2012 pharmaceutical manufacturers will be required to record any transfers of value made to doctors and teaching hospitals and to disclose such data to hhs with the initial disclosure to hhs due in 2013 in addition to civil penalties for failure to report transfers of value to physicians or teaching hospitals there will be criminal penalties if a manufacturer intentionally makes false statements in such reports further the increased access to such data by fraud and abuse investigators could potentially raise the risk of liability for improper payments under the false claims act 

  

medicare medicare part d went into effect on january 1 2006 elderly and disabled beneficiaries have access to the medicare drug benefit through private plans approved by the federal government beneficiaries with low incomes and modest assets are eligible for assistance with part d plan premiums and cost sharing nationally the share of such beneficiaries with comprehensive drug coverage increased from 59 in 2005 to over 90 in 2010 also in 2010 177 million people were enrolled in standalone prescription drug plans while 96 million were enrolled in medicare advantage plans or in other types of health plans with prescription drug coverage medicare beneficiaries report high levels of satisfaction with an overwhelming majority saying the program works well in addition the program costs less than originally expected according to the 2010 medicare trustees report total part d costs have declined 41 or 261 billion compared to the initial 10year cost estimate for 20042013 

the aca made some important changes to the drug benefit—in particular phasing out the coverage gap by 2020 prior to reform beneficiaries who reached a certain level of spending on prescription medications the part d coverage gap or “doughnut hole” had to pay 100 of the cost of their drugs until personal outofpocket spending reached a level qualifying them for catastrophic coverage the medicare part d coverage gap discount program uses public and private funding to relieve the financial burden facing beneficiaries who fall into the coverage gap for 2011 branded pharmaceutical companies will pay 50 of the cost of the branded drugs in the gap and the government will pay 7 of the cost for generic drugs in the gap as a result rather than paying 100 of the total cost of their drugs when they reach the coverage gap enrollees will pay 50 of the total cost of branded drugs and 93 of the total cost of generic drugs by 2020 enrollees will pay only 25 of the cost of their branded and generic drugs in the gap as the share covered by the government will increase 

biosimilars the aca also created a framework for the approval of followon biologics or biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with a potential six month pediatric extension the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation which will require the fda to address such key 

topics as the type and extent of data needed to establish biosimilarity the data required to achieve interchangeability compared to biosimilarity the naming of biosimilars the implications of having or not having unique names the tracking and tracing of adverse events and the acceptability of data from an exus licensed reference product comparator to demonstrate biosimilarity andor interchangeability 

medicaid and related matters federal law requires branded pharmaceutical companies to provide rebates to state medicaid agencies the aca has brought about major changes in the medicaid program collectively the measures i increased federal rebates paid by manufacturers on branded drugs within the traditional medicaid program from 151 to 231 and for generic drugs from 11 to 13 of average manufacturer price “amp” in 2010 ii expanded medicaid drug rebates to cover drugs provided through managed medicaid plans beginning in 2010 and iii expanded medicaid drug rebates to cover new formulations of brandname drugs beginning in 2010 the law also creates a federal upper limit under the medicaid program for generic drugs at 175 of amp in addition the law expands the types of entities eligible for the “section 340b discounts” for outpatient drugs provided in 2010 

the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain medicines to medicaid beneficiaries restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states access in the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state given states’ current and likely ongoing fiscal crises a growing number of states are considering a variety of costcontrol strategies including capitated managed care plans which typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments 

the aca expands medicaid coverage in 2014 it is expected that 16 million additional people will be enrolled in medicaid by 2019 

we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the revenues section of our 2010 financial report and in note 1h to our consolidated financial 

  

statements significant accounting policies revenues in our 2010 financial report which discussions are incorporated by reference 

marketing restrictions  federal healthcare professional payment disclosure provisions enacted under the aca require biopharmaceutical and medical device companies to report payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals to the secretary of hhs beginning in 2013 for 2012 transactions hhs is required to post these payments publicly on a website this national payment transparency effort and industry commitment to uphold voluntary codes of conduct the updated phrma code on interactions with healthcare professionals  phrma guiding principles direct to consumer advertisements about prescription medicines etc will complement existing laws and regulations to help ensure ethical collaboration and truthful product communications these efforts are in place to help ensure responsible marketing approaches and to address concerns 

importation of drugs there continue to be legislative proposals to amend us law to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs from outside the us which can be sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to welldocumented safety concerns such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us while the 2003 medicare modernization act maintains a prohibition on such imports it would allow importation from canada if the secretary of hhs certifies that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers before the 2003 medicare modernization act federal law would have permitted importation of medicines into the us from a considerably larger group of developed countries provided the secretary of hhs made the same safety and costsavings certifications as part of the debate on the aca two senate proposals that would have restored the broader number of countries from which importation would be permissible were introduced but were ultimately defeated 

the secretaries of hhs in the clinton george w bush and obama administrations have all declined to certify that importation of medicines is safe and saves money if the secretary of hhs changes its position an increase in crossborder trade in medicines subject to foreign price controls in other countries could occur 

in december 2004 hhs and the department of commerce issued reports on drug importation and foreign price controls the hhs report noted that it would be “extraordinarily difficult to ensure that drugs personally imported by individual consumers” could meet the standards of safety that would support certifying such importation as safe while the report also concluded that the us could establish a feasible basis for commercial drug importation such a change in the law would require “new legal authorities substantial additional resources and significant restrictions on the types of drugs that could be imported” the report also noted that the total savings to be expected from such a commercial importation regime would be relatively small—1 or 2 of total drug spending in the us 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe canada and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries 

europe the approval of new drugs across the eu may be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissioneuropean medicines agency ema centralized procedure these procedures apply in the eu member states plus the european economic area countries norway and iceland the use of these procedures generally provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

since the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states we continue to work with individual countries on such matters across the region 

the world economy in 2010 was recovering from the recent financial crisis and recession one of the consequences of the recession for almost all world economies has been an increased proportion of gross domestic product gdp arising from 

 

  

government spending and reduced tax receipts for many developed economies particularly in europe this exacerbated existing fiscal imbalances and increased net government debts under these macroeconomic conditions pfizer faced widespread incremental pressures on international pricing and reimbursement particularly in developed european markets with a high government share of pharmaceutical spending specific pricing pressures included increased mandatory rebates in germany and significant price cuts in greece portugal and spain 

formal processes of international reference pricing between eu countries add to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries price variations have also arisen from exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and other european currencies and these are also factored into international reference pricing systems 

during 2004 a comprehensive package of reforms was adopted amending eu law on the regulation of medicinal products pharmaceutical legislation in many areas including approval procedures and safety reporting many of these changes were aimed at facilitating the approval and launch of generic medicines and at streamlining regulatory procedures ahead of the accession of new member states to the eu these reforms included the introduction of a clear legal basis for the approval of biosimilar products in the eu following the effectiveness of these new regulations in november 2005 the first such products including a biosimilar version of genotropin  were approved in the eu in 2006 the new regulations also shortened certain approval timelines and introduced fasttrack and conditional centralized authorizations pfizer’s sutent was the first product to be conditionally approved under the new law in 2006 although its status subsequently was converted to full authorization in addition the data exclusivity periods during which innovative companies’ regulatory data are protected were required to be harmonized in all member states and for all routes of regulatory approval 

on january 26 2007 the new eu regulation on medicines for pediatric use became effective this introduced new obligations on pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on their medicines for children and subject to various conditions offered the possibility of incentives for so doing including exclusivity extensions the aim of this regulation is 

to improve the health of children in the eu through high quality research stimulating the development of new medicines creating infrastructure to enable authorized use and improving the information on medicines for children a pediatric committee pdco was created within the ema to provide scientific opinions and input on development plans for medicines for use with children in line with this regulation pfizer is conducting many pediatric research programs for its inline and development products and completed its first emaapproved pediatric investigation plan for lipitor  in 2009 

on december 31 2010 the eu published new pharmacovigilance legislation which had been adopted by the council and parliament of the eu the legislation will come into effect in mid2012 and entails many new and revised requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance as well as the codification of various existing requirements previously set out in guidance key changes include the possibility for regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct postauthorization efficacy studies both at the time of approval and at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments there are also additional requirements to include statements in product labelling with regard to adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products there will also be significantly greater transparency of the safety review process 

the new legislation forms part of a threepart “pharmaceutical package” to amend the existing eu pharmaceutical legislation the other parts concern legislative changes in the fields of i counterfeit medicines which is expected to be adopted in the first quarter of 2011 and ii the provision of information on prescription medicines to patients which has reached a reasonably advanced stage but has proved controversial to date and the outcome for which is more uncertain 

at the end of the third quarter of 2010 the commissioner for industry and entrepreneurship of the european commission announced the launch of a process on corporate responsibility in the pharmaceutical industry the process includes three independent platforms i transparency and ethics in the sector ii access to medicines in africa and iii access to medicines in europe in the context of pricing and reimbursement the platform on access 

 

  

to medicines in europe will focus on enhancing collaboration among eu member states and relevant stakeholders in order to find common nonregulatory approaches to ensure “timely and equitable access to medicines” 

canada health canada is the government agency that provides regulatory and marketing approval for drugs and therapeutic products in canada in october 2006 health canada introduced its modernization initiative under the blueprint for renewal modernizing canada’s regulatory system for health products and food policy framework the blueprint includes 10 objectives including the progressive licensing framework plf also referred to as the legislative and regulatory modernization lrm stronger postmarket safety and surveillance systems and strengthening compliance and enforcement with a directive towards an integrated health system including closer alignment of healthcare objectives with provinces and territories in december 2007 the new food and consumer safety action plan w as issued followed in april 2008 by the introduction of bill c51 a proposed enabling legislation to amend the food and drugs act if passed it would represent a significant drug regulatory system reform and a major change to canada’s drug approval system the bill was not reintroduced in 2010 as expected however the government continues to express commitment to its reintroduction current regulatory policies and initiatives such as priority and conditional approvals are already providing for internationally competitive approval timelines as in the eu sutent was initially approved under the conditional provision however unprecedented advances in science and technology are presenting a potential challenge for health canada’s ability to maintain internationally competitive market authorizations in october 2010 health canada accelerated their modernization efforts this included the proposed regulatory pathways for orphan drugs harmonized with useu regulations and for biosimilars referred to as “subsequent entry biologics” sebs this would formalize into regulations health canada’s guidance document which provided for approval of sebs in 2009 

introductory “nonexcessive” prices and price increases are controlled by the federal patented medicines prices review board canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs which was implemented under the data protection regulations 

and provides for a minimum of eight years of data protection for new chemical entities has been challenged by recent litigation that has favored generic manufacturers the federal government also has jurisdiction over international trade and therefore over the issue of crossborder trade in pharmaceuticals and internet pharmacies 

asia the regulatory environment in asia presents multiple issues for companies trying to achieve simultaneous global development and registration ie marketing products at the same time as in the us europe canada and elsewhere while each country in asia has its unique regulatory concerns there are a number of regulatory issues that are common among the majority of asian countries for example with the exception of japan health authorities in asia generally require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority eg the us fda before they begin to conduct their application review process andor issue their final approval proof of reference country approval is usually satisfied by companies submitting a certificate of pharmaceutical product cpp which is a legal document that is issued by the competent health authority certifying that the company’s product has satisfied its country’s registration requirements and manufacturing standards at a minimum this requirement delays marketing authorization in asia by 1215 months following market authorization in the us and europe 

another common regulatory issue in japan and other asian countries is the requirement for local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval each of japan china korea taiwan and india has regulations in some form that require clinical studies in their country eg china requires a prescribed number of chinese patients regardless of the product therapeutic area or disease population although some agencies have shown flexibility based on scientific rationale related to ethnicity assessments it is not uncommon for companies to be required to duplicate costly clinical trials in asia pursuant to these regulations this can further add to marketing approval delays compared to the us and europe 

the controlling regulatory agency in china is the state food and drug administration sfda sfda’s scope of responsibilities is similar to that of the fda or ema 

 

  

two key agencies within sfda are the center for drug evaluation cde and the national institute for the control of pharmaceutical and biological products nicpbp the cde which is analogous to the fda’s center for drug evaluation and research cder is primarily responsible for the technical review of product applications including clinical trial applications cta and new drug applications nda and drafting technical guidance documents nicpbp is the quality testing arm of sfda legally responsible for the testing of pharmaceuticals biologics and medical devices nationwide 

china’s regulatory system is unique in many ways and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with international standards as a result it is not uncommon to see treatments entering the market in china two to four years after first marketing in the us and europe 

intellectual property  although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern for foreign companies the intellectual property environment has improved in china the government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with wto provisions and several companies have established research and development centers in china due to more confidence in china’s intellectual property environment however china remains on the us department of commerce priority watch list for 2011 a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years but enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent such as no effective patent linkage mechanism noted below no preliminary injunctions impractical evidentiary burdens and heightened sufficiency standards used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage 

additionally true data exclusivity still remains elusive in china the cde provides protection against reliance on data by generic applicants for a fixed period of time following its wto accession in 2001 china revised its laws to incorporate concepts from the wtotrips and china’s relevant laws establish a sixyear period of protection against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test and other data of products containing a new chemical ingredient however the current regulations are ambiguous as to how data protection is implemented in practice in china for example certain key concepts such as “new chemical ingredient” and “unfair commercial use” are undefined 

environmental law compliance 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2010 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2010 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

  

 while we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with pending legislation and potential regulation and potential legislation related to climate change we have no reason to believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

we have reviewed the potential for physical risks to our facilities and supply chain that may be exacerbated by climate change and have concluded that because of our facility locations and our existing distribution networks we do not believe these risks are material in the near term

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2010 form 10k and in our 2010 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” “target” “forecast” and similar expressions or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance business plans or prospects inline products and product candidates and sharerepurchase and dividendrate plans in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to substantial risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forwardlooking statements 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures 

we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

healthcare reform 

as mentioned earlier the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and its provisions are effective on various dates over the next several years we expect that the rebates discounts taxes and other costs over time will have a significant effect on our expenses and profitability in the future see the discussion under us healthcare legislation in our 2010 financial report furthermore the ipab created by the aca to reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending could potentially limit access to certain treatments or mandate price controls for our products moreover expanded government investigative authority may increase the costs of compliance with new negotiations and programs we also face the uncertainties that might result from any modification repeal or invalidation of any of the provisions of the aca 

government regulation and managed care trends 

us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations in the us many of our biopharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures have increased as the result of the 2003 medicare modernization act due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in addition if the 2003 medicare modernization act or the aca were amended to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions it would have a significant adverse 

 

  

impact on our business furthermore mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patientaccess constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising or limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 

the prohibition on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of erectile dysfunction medications by the medicaid program which became effective january 1 2006 and the similar federal funding prohibition for the medicare part d program which became effective january 1 2007 has had an adverse effect on our business any prohibitions on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of other classes of drugs in the future may also have an adverse effect 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system in particular there were governmentmandated price reductions for certain biopharmaceutical products in certain european countries in 2010 and we anticipate continuing pricing pressures in europe in 2011 this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products between countries as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions could also adversely impact revenue 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us around the world upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period which can adversely affect our business 

also the patents covering several of our most important medicines including lipitor caduet viagra detroldetrol la lyrica sutent tygacil  rapamune  relpax  and zyvox are being challenged by generic manufacturers in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with ours including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

dependence on key inline products 

we recorded direct product revenues of more than 1 billion for each of 15 biopharmaceutical products in 2010 lipitor enbrel lyrica  prevnarprevenar 13 celebrex  viagra  xalatanxalacom  effexoreffexor xr  norvasc  prevnarprevenar 7valent zyvox sutent premarin family  geodonzeldox and detroldetrol la  those products accounted for 60 of our total biopharmaceutical revenues in 2010 lipitor sales in 2010 were approximately 107 billion accounting for approximately 18 of our total 2010 biopharmaceutical revenues if the products referenced above or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected 

 

  

side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant as noted patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges we expect we will lose exclusivity for lipitor in the us in november 2011 and as a result will lose the substantial portion of our us revenues from lipitor shortly thereafter in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that have smaller patient populations such as certain types of cancer and multiple sclerosis the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products is beginning to generate significant payer interest in developing costcontainment strategies targeted to this sector while the impact on pfizer of payers’ efforts to control access and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has been limited to date our growing portfolio of specialty products combined with the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world and the deteriorating finances of governments may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are very important to the success of the company however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

additionally pfizer’s research and development investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between the science and the market the company may not be investing in the right technology platforms leading therapeutic segments product classes geographic markets andor inlicensing and outlicensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipeline additionally even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the science may not work for any given program 

we recently announced a focus on fewer disease areas where we believe we can deliver the greatest medical and commercial success there can be no assurance that this strategy will deliver the desired result which could affect profitability in the future 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

risks and uncertainties apply particularly with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain drug discovery and development is timeconsuming expensive and unpredictable the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products there is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings should they occur there also are many considerations that can affect marketing of our products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements 

 

  

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase iv trials could result in loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 the fdaaa gives the fda enhanced postmarket authority including the explicit authority to require postmarket studies and clinical trials labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with fdaapproved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies the fda’s exercise of its authority under the fdaaa could result in delays or increased costs during product development clinical trials and regulatory review increased costs to comply with additional postapproval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable costs postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect sales of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate or are perceived to implicate an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of the affected products accordingly new data about our products or products similar to our products could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of our products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of our products 

biotechnology products 

the aca has created a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the us following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator 

biologic with a potential six month pediatric extension such biosimilars could reference biotechnology products already approved under the us public health service act additionally the fda has approved a biosimilar recombinant human growth hormone genotropin  that referenced a biotechnology product approved under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could generally trigger this competition assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired we expect that we could face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results 

interest rate and foreign exchange risk 

57 of our total 2010 revenues were derived from international operations including 28 from the europe region and 18 from the japanasia region these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international net assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management in our 2010 financial 

 

  

report for additional details see note 9e to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2010 financial report those sections of our 2010 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations also could be affected by capital and exchange controls expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by political unrest unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

diversified segment 

our animal health unit may be impacted by challenging global economic conditions resulting in high unemployment rates and tight credit conditions a high unemployment rate typically results in reduced traffic in veterinary clinics negatively impacting our companion animal business tight credit conditions limit the borrowing power of livestock producers causing some to switch to lowerpriced alternatives 

pfizer nutrition may be impacted by challenging global economic conditions and the resulting effect on consumer spending increased competition particularly in high growth emerging markets is also a risk for this business the nutrition business may also experience significant financial impact associated with changes in national regional and international laws rules and guidelines and their enforcement our infant and young child nutrition products are subject to an array of rules and regulations enforced by government entities as well as treaties conventions and guidelines from international authorities changes to these requirements can significantly impact costs relating to taxes tariffs trade labeling marketing manufacturing and the overall availability of our products 

the consumer healthcare unit may be impacted by economic volatility and generic competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal andor reformulation of certain products eg coughcold products 

global economic conditions 

the global economic downturn and the challenging global economic environment has not had nor do we anticipate it will have a material impact on our liquidity due to our significant operating cash flow financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as market conditions change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position however there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions 

in addition to industryspecific factors we like other businesses continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the us and europe affecting the performance of products such as lipitor  celebrex and lyrica  we believe that patients experiencing the effects of the challenging economic environment including high unemployment levels and increases in copays sometimes switch to generic products delay treatments skip doses or use less effective treatments to reduce their costs challenging economic conditions in the us also have increased the number of patients in the medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and in many states to formulary restrictions limiting access to brandname drugs including ours in addition during 2010 we continued to experience pricing pressure as a result of the economic environment in europe with governmentmandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products in certain european countries 

outsourcing 

outsourcing to third parties in areas including transaction processing accounting information 

 

  

technology manufacturing clinical trials nonclinical studies research and development safety and other areas could expose us to suboptimal quality missed deadlines or supply disruptions all with potential negative implications for our results 

interactions with healthcare professionals 

risks and uncertainties apply where the company provides something of value to a healthcare professional andor government official which if found to be improper could potentially result in government enforcement actions and penalties these risks may increase as nonus jurisdictions adopt new antibribery laws and regulations 

difficulties of our wholesale distributors 

in 2010 our largest wholesale distributor accounted for approximately 14 of our total revenue and our top three wholesale distributors accounted for approximately 34 of our total revenue if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products or the possibility that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected or that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network could affect future results 

cost and expense controlunusual events 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to 

successfully implement our announced plans regarding the company’s research and development function including the planned exit from the company’s sandwich uk site subject to works council and union consultations as well as our ability to realize the projected benefits of our costreduction initiatives including those related to the wyeth integration and to our research and development function 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that result from the enactment in august 2010 of the education jobs and medicaid assistance act of 2010 and that may result from pending and possible future proposals competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities environmental and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period we also may fail to identify or prevent noncompliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation 

 

  

patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through acquisitions licensing and alliances see our business development initiatives—strategy and recent transactions in our 2010 financial report which is incorporated by reference however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities and competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities 

information technology 

we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

failure to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of wyeth 

the success of our acquisition of wyeth will depend in large part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from integrating the operations of pfizer and wyeth if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations of the two legacy companies the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected

business segments 

effective with the acquisition of wyeth we have operated two distinct commercial organizations which constitute our two business segments biopharmaceutical and diversified biopharmaceutical includes the primary care specialty care established products emerging markets and oncology customerfocused units which include products that prevent and treat cardiovascular and metabolic diseases central nervous system disorders arthritis and pain infectious and respiratory diseases urogenital conditions cancer eye disease and endocrine disorders among others diversified includes animal health products that prevent and treat diseases in livestock and companion animals consumer healthcare products that include overthecounter health care products such as pain management therapies coughcoldallergy remedies dietary supplements hemorrhoidal care and personal care items nutrition products such as infant and toddler formula products and capsugel which represents our gelatin capsules business 

comparative segment information for 2009 2008 and 2007 is presented in the tables captioned segment revenue and profit segment assets property plant and equipment additions and depreciation and amortization geographic and revenues by product in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and 

revenue information in our 2009 financial report the information from those tables in our 2009 financial report is incorporated by reference in this 2009 form 10k 

our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate in the us the principal authority regulating our operations is the food and drug administration fda the fda regulates the safety and efficacy of the products we offer and our research quality manufacturing processes product promotion advertising and product labeling similar regulations exist in most other countries and in many countries the government also regulates our prices see government regulation and price constraints below 

biopharmaceutical 

revenues from the biopharmaceutical segment contributed approximately 91 of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008 and 92 of our total revenues in 2007 

we recorded direct product sales of more than 1 billion for each of nine legacy pfizer products in 2009 each of nine products in 2008 and each of eight products in 2007 these products represented 56 of our biopharmaceutical revenues in 2009 60 of our biopharmaceutical revenues in 2008 and 58 of our biopharmaceutical revenues in 2007 we did not record more than 1 billion in revenue for any individual legacy wyeth product in 2009 since the wyeth acquisition date of october 15 2009 

worldwide biopharmaceutical revenues in 2009 were 454 billion an increase of 3 compared to 2008 primarily due to revenues from legacy wyeth products of approximately 25 billion solid operational performance from certain legacy pfizer products including lyrica  sutent and revatio  and higher legacy pfizer alliance revenues partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies primarily the euro uk pound canadian dollar australian dollar and brazilian real which unfavorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by approximately 17 billion or 4 in 2009 and a decrease in revenues from certain legacy pfizer products including lipitor norvasc  camptosar and chantixchampix  

geographically in the us biopharmaceutical revenues increased 6 in 2009 primarily due to 

  

revenues from legacy wyeth products of approximately 16 billion or 9 and by the solid performance from certain legacy pfizer products including lyrica viagra revatio xalatan and sutent  and higher alliance revenue in 2009 which was partially offset by lower revenues from certain legacy pfizer products including lipitor and celebrex compared to 2008 as a result of continued generic pressures legacy pfizer revenues also were adversely affected by the loss of exclusivity of camptosar and zyrteczyrtec d  lower sales of chantix following changes to the product label increased rebates partly as a result of the impact of certain contract changes and increased pricing pressures 

in our international markets biopharmaceutical revenues were flat in 2009 compared to 2008 higher revenues due to the addition of legacy wyeth products of 931 million or 4 and higher operational revenues from legacy pfizer products of 854 million or 3 were offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on international revenues of 17 billion or 7 the increase in operational revenues of legacy pfizer products was due to operational growth from lipitor lyrica zyvox vfend  sutent and higher alliance revenues partially offset by lower revenues from norvasc and camptosar  among others

 diversified 

worldwide diversified revenues in 2009 were 42 billion an increase of 17 compared to 2008 due to revenues from legacy wyeth products of approximately 764 million primarily from the addition of legacy wyeth consumer healthcare and nutrition operations partially offset by a decrease in revenues due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the legacy pfizer animal health and capsugel units 

animal health 

our animal health unit is one of the largest in the world we discover develop and sell products for the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock and companion animals revenues from animal health products decreased 2 in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 5 flat operational performance of legacy pfizer animal health products partially offset by the revenue increase from the addition of legacy wyeth animal health products of 3 the following factors impacted 2009 results 

 

  

  

 among the products we market are antibiotics antiinflammatories antiemetics parasiticides and vaccines including the following products

 nutrition 

pfizer nutrition which is a legacy wyeth unit is a leader in infant nutritionals in the markets in which we operate we have a focused presence in key markets throughout asia the middle east europe and latin america with china the philippines the uk mexico and australia being among our top markets as part of pfizer nutrition will have enhanced opportunities to grow in new and existing markets as well as to leverage strengths from the combined company to accelerate innovation and develop new products revenues of 191 million for 2009 reflect revenue generated by pfizer nutrition after the close of the wyeth acquisition on october 15 2009 

nutrition products include our s26 preterm feeding system specialty formulas such as s26 pe gold and a range of agespecific products that include s26 pe gold progress promil and promise 

capsugel 

capsugel has a diverse product line that includes not only hard gelatin capsules but also liquid softgel nonanimal and fish gelatin capsules all for use in pharmaceutical and dietary supplement dosage delivery 

  

research and development 

innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs this goal has been supported by our substantial research and development investments we spent 78 billion in 2009 79 billion in 2008 and 81 billion in 2007 on research and development 

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through acquisition licensing or other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable according to the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma out of 500010000 screened compounds only 250 enter preclinical testing five enter human clinical trials and one is approved by the fda the process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

we believe that the effect of our significant investments in research is reflected in the number of robust pharmaceutical candidates we have in all stages of development as of january 27 2010 we had about 500 projects in development ranging from discovery through registration of which 133 programs are from phase 1 through registration the projects within our “invest to win” areas include 30 compounds for various oncology indications 10 compounds for alzheimer’s disease eight compounds for pain 11 compounds for inflammation six vaccines and 27 biologics at yearend 2009 our phase iii portfolio contained 34 programs while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering development are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations seek to add value to 

  

our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments in our 2009 financial report that information is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product obsolescence 

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same segments as our us operations—biopharmaceutical and diversified 

revenues from operations outside the us of 283 billion accounted for 57 of our total revenues in 2009 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 13 countries outside the us in 2009 the us was the only country to contribute more than 10 of our total revenues comprising 43 of total revenues in 2009 423 of total revenues in 2008 and 478 of total revenues in 2007 japan is our secondlargest national market with 85 of total revenues in 2009 77 of total revenues in 2008 and 70 of total revenues in 2007 

for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues see the table captioned geographic in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and revenue information in our 2009 financial report and the table captioned change in revenues by segment and geographic area in our 2009 financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions our international businesses are 

also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws on pricing reimbursement and access to our products see government regulation and price constraints below for a discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2009 both revenues and net income were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange in general as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar decreased our revenues and net income in many countries while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments see the discussion under note 9e to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2009 financial report that discussion is incorporated by reference related information about valuation and risks associated with such financial instruments in part f of that note is also incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global biopharmaceutical segment we promote our products to health care providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to health care providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos employers and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness prevention and wellness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

in january 2009 we announced the creation of customerfocused units within our biopharmaceutical segment to better meet the diverse needs of physicians patients and our customers while maximizing value for our company and our shareholders 

  

the biopharmaceutical segment includes five human health customerfocused units primary care specialty care oncology established products and emerging markets upon the closing of the wyeth acquisition on october 15 2009 our specialty care customerfocused unit expanded to include vaccines 

in april 2009 in the us we also restructured into regional units in order to create a more flexible organization empowered to identify and address local market dynamics and customer needs our structure aligns the sales marketing and medical functions to work closely to meet the needs of key customer segments while ensuring common coordination focus and accountability across the organizations 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies we seek to gain access to health authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended approved andor reimbursed medicines and other products we also work with mcos pbms employers and other appropriate health care providers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

during 2009 pfizer revenues generated from our three largest biopharmaceutical wholesalers were as follows 

 

  

  

 sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the biopharmaceutical segment apart from these instances neither of our business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers 

our global diversified segment consists of four global units animal health consumer healthcare nutrition and capsugel each unit utilizes its own sales and marketing organization to promote its products and occasionally uses distributors in smaller markets 

  

our animal health unit’s advertising and promotions are generally targeted to health care professionals directly and through veterinary journals animal health products are sold through veterinarians distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users 

our consumer healthcare unit’s advertising and promotions are generally targeted to consumers through television print and other media advertising as well as through instore promotion consumer healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies and retail chains 

our nutrition unit supports and adheres to the world health organization code and national codes on the marketing of breast milk substitutes nutrition encourages breastfeeding as the best nutrition for infants and provides important products for infants who are not exclusively breastfed advertising and promotion of our nutrition products for older children and adults generally target consumers and health care professionals through print and media advertising and television our nutrition products are sold through a wide variety of channels including distributors pharmacies hospitals and retail chains 

patents and intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type 

  

of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period are those for the drugs set forth in the table below 

 

 in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

aricept is patented by eisai co ltd we copromote aricept with eisai in the us and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug in certain other countries 

we have exclusive rights to enbrel outside the us and canada and we copromote enbrel with amgen in the us and canada 

  

in addition to our us basic product patent for lipitor which including the pediatric exclusivity period expires in march 2010 we have a patent covering specifically the enantiomeric form of the drug which including the pediatric exclusivity period expires in june 2011 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2009 financial report regarding pending legal challenges to our lipitor patents in the us 

the basic patent for venlafaxine the active ingredient in effexor and the extended release product  effexor xr  expired in 2008 however we hold several patents expiring as late as 2017 relating to extended release formulations and methods of using extended release formulations of venlafaxine hci in 2005 wyeth entered into a settlement of patent litigation against teva pharmaceuticals usa inc teva usa and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd teva industries pursuant to which teva usa and teva industries are permitted to launch generic versions of effexor xr in the us beginning on july 1 2010 subject to possible earlier launch based on specified market conditions or developments regarding the applicable patent rights including the outcome of other generic challenges to such patent rights since the settlement with teva usa and teva industries wyeth settled patent suits against certain other generic companies that generally grant licenses permitting the generic companies to launch generic versions of effexor xr in the us on or after june 1 2011 subject to possible earlier launch in limited circumstances but in no event earlier than january 1 2011 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2009 financial report regarding pending legal proceedings related to our effexor patent 

in october 2009 we settled certain patent litigation involving vfend by entering into an agreement granting two subsidiaries of mylan inc the right to market voriconazole tablets in the us beginning in the first quarter of 2011 

zosyn tazocin and protonix face generic competition in the us 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor caduet detroldetrol la lyrica tygacil and zyvox  

  

in addition a company has filed an application with the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of aricept which is patented by eisai co ltd wyeth and a subsidiary of wyeth are defendants in a lawsuit alleging that their refacto and xyntha products infringe the patents of another company 

we also have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues than most of the products set forth in the table above 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short period in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to overthecounter products 

our biotechnology products including enbrel and prevnar 7  may face competition from biosimilars also referred to as “followon biologics” such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products already approved under the us public health service act abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets in the us there is not currently an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilars however legislation to establish such a pathway is being considered in congress additionally the fda has approved a biosimilar recombinant human growth hormone that referenced a biotechnology product approved under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act 

in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure expiration or successful 

challenge of applicable patent rights could generally trigger this competition assuming any relevant data exclusivity period has expired 

we expect that we may face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2016 for leastdeveloped nations a number of countries have made improvements we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in other participant countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our human prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded drugs or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our acquisition of wyeth in october 2009 created a broader more diverse portfolio and pipeline with industryleading positions in potential highgrowth areas further strengthened by new capabilities in biotechnology and vaccines the combined company not only strengthens our presence in the united states and europe but also enhances our abilities to provide emerging markets in china latin america africa and the middle east with highquality innovative medicines 

  

our competitors include other worldwide researchbased drug companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and consumer health care manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases or indications as our major products 

such competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in research and development as well as our emphasis on business development over the past decade all resulting in a strong product pipeline our investment in research does not stop with a drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potential new applications we seek to protect the health and wellbeing of patients by ensuring that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also continue to enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespeople’s efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs for instance we restructured into regional units in order to create a more flexible organization empowered to identify and address local market dynamics and customer needs we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to health care professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better health care solutions 

while our animal health unit is one of the largest in the world many other companies offer 

competing products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include product innovation quality price service and effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers 

our consumer healthcare unit faces competition from otc business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies as well as retailers who carry their own private label brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including the amount of resources relative to competitors deployed to develop enhance and promote products the effectiveness of our promotional efforts customer acceptance product quality new product launches development of alternative therapies by competitors growth of lower cost private label brands regulatory and legislative issues and scientific and technological advances 

our nutrition unit has many competitors including several multinational companies as well as numerous local privatelyowned brands our competitive position is affected by several factors including the amount of resources deployed to develop enhance and promote products the effectiveness of our promotional efforts customer acceptance product quality new product launches development of alternative products by competitors growth of lowercost private label brands regulatory and legislative issues and scientific and technological advances 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the health care marketplace approximately 250 million people in the us now participate in some version of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos the marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations continues to grow in importance 

mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators health maintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has increased in recent 

  

years due to the growing numbers of patients enrolled in mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce health care expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers they use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other restrictions such as requiring prior authorizations can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on most mco formularies 

the impact of mcos on drug prices and volumes has increased as the result of their role in 

negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit medicare part d that took effect january 1 2006 mcos and pbms negotiate on behalf of the federal government as prescription drug plans pdps we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products that are used by the senior population included on the formularies of the new medicare pdps for 2009 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product especially a small molecule product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiry generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about our products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor began to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their health care programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the 

  

substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary sells generic versions of pfizer’s as well as certain of our competitors’ pharmaceutical products upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2009 and none are expected in 2010 however select agriculturalbased materials have from time to time increased in price due to shortterm imbalances between supply and demand we have successfully secured these materials to meet our requirements in these circumstances but generally at higher prices than those historically paid 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance is the fda in the us it has jurisdiction over our biopharmaceutical segment and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of our biopharmaceutical products the fda also regulates our consumer healthcare nutrition and capsugel products as well as our animal health products the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some of our products 

in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission which also has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer health care products including overthecounter drugs and dietary supplements and the department of justice individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection 

and false advertising laws we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various regulatory bodies see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2009 financial report such actions may include product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

the us congress and the fda are considering proposals to clarify how the fda assesses “followon biological” products depending on the specific provisions legislative or regulatory changes that would facilitate the approval of such products could have an adverse impact on our business 

medicare in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 medicare modernization act was enacted medicare beneficiaries are now eligible to obtain subsidized prescription drug coverage from a choice of private sector plans approximately 90 of medicare beneficiaries now have coverage for prescription medicines with high levels of beneficiary satisfaction and lowerthanexpected costs to the government and to beneficiaries the use of pharmaceuticals has increased slightly among some patients as the result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by coverage under medicare however such expanded utilization has been largely offset by increased pricing pressure and competition due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries and by an increase in the use of generic medicines in this population despite the success of medicare part d legislative changes have been proposed to mandate government rebates in medicare and to allow the federal government to directly negotiate prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers it is expected that if legislation were enacted to mandate rebates or provide for direct government negotiation in medicare part d access and reimbursement for our products would be restricted 

pfizer is committed to helping ensure that all americans without coverage for prescription medicines have access to pfizer products to that end in 2004 we implemented our helpful answers program an umbrella program that brings together pfizer’s longstanding patient assistance programs with pfizer pfriends a prescription discount card offering savings on pfizer prescription medicines for all americans without prescription drug coverage 

  

regardless of age or income in addition in january 2005 we joined together rx access with nine other pharmaceutical companies to offer savings on over 275 medicines to medicareineligible uninsured individuals under 65 who fall below certain income thresholds pfizer also participates in the partnership for prescription assistance a single point of access to more than 475 public and private patient assistance programs more recently the pfizer maintain program medicines assistance for those who are in need provides delivery of free pfizer medicines to the homes of qualified patients this program is intended to provide pfizer medicines to patients who have recently become unemployed and are uninsured 

if federal health care reform proposals see risk factors for a discussion of the potential risks health care reform may have on our business currently before the congress are passed there may be changes to the existing medicare part d such changes may include a requirement for pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a portion of the cost of medications when patients reach the current coverage gap see health care reform below this cost offset is expected to be passed on to patients purchasing their medications at pharmacies while the decrease in patient costs will assist patients in affording their medications it will also reduce revenues for the medications sold during this coverage gap 

importation of drugs there continue to be legislative proposals to amend us law to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs from outside the us which can be sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to welldocumented safety concerns such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us while the 2003 medicare modernization act maintains a prohibition on such imports it would allow importation from canada if the secretary of hhs certifies that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers before the 2003 medicare modernization act federal law would have permitted importation of medicines into the us from a considerably larger group of developed countries provided the secretary of hhs made the same safety and costsavings certifications 

the secretaries of hhs in both the clinton and george w bush administrations declined to certify that importation of medicines is safe and saves 

money if the current secretary of hhs were to certify that importation is safe and saves money an increase in crossborder trade in medicines subject to foreign price controls in other countries could occur and could have an adverse impact on our business 

in december 2004 hhs and the department of commerce issued reports on drug importation and foreign price controls the hhs report noted that it would be “extraordinarily difficult to ensure that drugs personally imported by individual consumers” could meet the standards of safety that would support certifying such importation as safe while the report also concluded that the us could establish a feasible basis for commercial drug importation such a change in the law would require “new legal authorities substantial additional resources and significant restrictions on the types of drugs that could be imported” the report also noted that the total savings to be expected from such a commercial importation regime would be relatively small—1 or 2 of total drug spending in the us the commerce department report confirmed that the lower prices in many countries result from governmental price controls and these price controls adversely affect the amount of funding that is available for the discovery of new drugs rand health a division of the rand corporation released a study in december 2008 showing that price controls in the us would have a significant negative impact on health in both the us and abroad by deterring the investment that leads to the discovery of new medicines 

medicaid and related matters federal law requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program in recent years various proposals have been offered at federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the medicaid program in the short term driven by budget concerns many states have implemented restrictive drug lists and state supplemental rebate programs under the medicaid program the downturn in state revenues coupled with an anticipated increase in medicaid program enrollment due to a declining economy could cause rebate payments to rise in 2010 should congress pass federal health care reform proposals currently before the congress an increase in pharmaceutical rebates paid to the program is anticipated the increase would most likely be the result of an increase in the number of individuals 

  

eligible for the medicaid program an expansion of entities eligible for the medicaid rebate such as medicaid managed care programs and an increase in the minimum rebate required for participation in the program the anticipated increase in the minimum rebate may also have implications for the federal 340b program that requires the offering of discounts based at a minimum to the rebates paid in the medicaid program an expansion of entities that may become eligible for access to discounts offered through the 340b program may also increase the discounts that are required 

the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict medicaid beneficiaries’ access to certain medicines restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states access in the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state access may vary by plan however there have been legislative proposals to apply government mandated medicaid rebates to the medicaid managed care program 

effective january 1 2007 changes to the treatment of authorized generics for purposes of calculating medicaid rebates increased the amount of rebates we are required to pay on brand name drug sales after loss of exclusivity and on authorized generic sales to the medicaid program in an effort to increase coverage of the low income uninsured a number of states are also considering expansion of eligibility for their medicaid programs that would result in increased exposure to medicaid rebates though mostly to populations that currently do not have prescription drug coverage 

some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible 

if many states were to require increased rebate payments in discount programs for the uninsured and link medicaid beneficiaries’ access to our products to such discount programs the impact on patients’ access to medicines and on pfizer could be significant 

we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in 

the revenues section of our 2009 financial report and in note 1h to our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies revenues in our 2009 financial report which discussions are incorporated by reference 

marketing restrictions  a number of states are considering programs to control pharmaceutical marketing activities that go beyond commitments made related to adhering to the recently revised and strengthened phrma code for interactions with healthcare professionals if implemented such efforts have the potential to limit appropriate communication activities with health care professionals prescribing our medications 

health care reform we continue to be a constructive force in helping to shape health care policy and regulation of our products although we cannot predict the outcome of pending and possible future us health care reform initiatives we remain committed and actively engaged in discussions to reform health care in a way that expands coverage for those currently uninsured does not erode coverage for those currently insured improves quality rewards innovation and provides value for patients during the second quarter of 2009 phrma of which we are a member announced an 80 billion commitment over the next decade to support health care reform in the us among other things that commitment includes reducing the cost of medicines for seniors and disabled americans who are affected by the coverage gap in the medicare prescription drug program the phrma commitment is intended to be part of any federal health care reform legislation in the us 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe canada and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices 

  

the approval of new drugs across the european union eu may only be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissioneuropean medicines agency ema central approval process which applies in the eu member states plus norway and iceland which are full participants in these registration processes the use of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

since the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states we continue to work with individual countries on such matters across the region 

during 2004 a comprehensive package of reforms was adopted amending eu law on the regulation of medicinal products in many areas including approval procedures and safety reporting of particular note the data exclusivity periods during which innovative companies’ regulatory data are protected are required to be harmonized in all member states in addition these reforms introduced a clear legal basis for the approval of biosimilar or “followon biological” products in the eu following the effectiveness of these new regulations in november 2005 the first such products including a biosimilar version of genotropin  were approved in the eu in 2006 the new regulations also shortened certain approval timelines and introduced fasttrack and conditional centralized authorizations pfizer’s sutent was the first product to be conditionally approved under the new law in 2006 although its status subsequently was converted to full authorization at present a new reform proposal is pending in the eu which would introduce changes to address the problem of counterfeit medicines and to make improvements to the pharmacovigilance system this proposal also includes changes to allow pharmaceutical companies to provide certain nonpromotional information on their medicines to the public however this has proved particularly contentious and as such is expected to be dealt with separately 

on january 26 2007 the new eu regulation on medicines for pediatric use became effective this introduced new obligations on pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on their medicines for children and subject to various conditions offered 

the possibility of incentives for so doing including exclusivity extensions the aim of this regulation is to improve the health of children in the eu through high quality research stimulating the development of new medicines creating infrastructure to enable authorized use and improving the information on medicines for children a pediatric committee pdco was created within the ema to provide scientific opinions and input on development plans for medicines for use with children in line with this regulation pfizer is conducting many pediatric research programs for its inline and development products and completed its first emaapproved pediatric investigation plan for lipitor  in 2009 

on november 28 2007 the eu commission hosted the transatlantic administrative simplification workshop cochaired by the eu commission and the fda in cooperation with the ema and the heads of european medicines agencies to identify opportunities for administrative simplification between the us and the eu in the field of pharmaceutical regulation these opportunities included possible harmonization of administrative practices and guidelines not necessitating changes in regulations while maintaining or increasing the current levels of public health protection by freeing up resources this cooperation will allow the industry to focus more of its resources on developing and supplying medicines to meet the needs of patients during the annual eu  emafda bilateral meeting in september 2009 the parties provided an update on the status of the implementation of the administrative simplification project these efforts are continuing and interagency dialogue is expanding into a range of areas such as pediatric development 

health canada is the government agency that provides regulatory and marketing approval for drugs and therapeutic products in canada in october 2006 health canada introduced its modernization initiative under the blueprint for renewal modernizing canada’s regulatory system for health products and food policy framework the blueprint includes ten objectives among which are the progressive licensing framework plf now referred to as the legislative and regulatory modernization lrm for pharmaceuticals and biologics adoption of a product lifecycle approach to regulations stronger postmarket safety and surveillance systems increased transparency and openness emphasis on special 

  

populations including the establishment of the expert advisory committee on pediatrics strengthening compliance and enforcement and moving to an integrated health system closer collaboration and consultation with provinces and territories with respect to access in december 2007 the federal government issued its new food and consumer safety action plan followed by bill c51 april 2008 with proposed legislative amendments to the food and drugs act the bill is expected to be reintroduced in 2010 and if passed would represent a significant drug regulatory system reform and a major change to canada’s drug approval system under the lrm and its “lifecycle” approach to regulation health canada is seeking to establish flexibility in the market authorization process that will lead to earlier and more appropriate access for patients to promising therapeutic products as well as focus on best patient outcomes current regulatory policies and initiatives such as priority and conditional approvals are already providing for internationally competitive approval timelines as in the eu sutent was initially approved under the conditional provision 

health canada under its current regulatory authority and draft guidance of march 2009 approved in april 2009 the first “subsequent entry biologic” seb omnitrope also referred to in other jurisdictions as biosimilar or followonbiologic omnitrope used pfizer’s genotropin as its reference product to demonstrate comparabilitysimilarity according to health canada sebs like any new drugs cannot be substituted or used interchangeably with the reference product used in the studies furthermore the modernization initiative is proposing the introduction of a legislative and regulatory framework for drugs for rare disorders ie orphan drugs in the us and eu updated cost recovery framework ie user fees a specific regulatory framework for sebs and legislation strengthening postmarket safety requirements 

introductory “nonexcessive” prices and price increases are controlled by the federal patented medicines prices review board canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs which was implemented under the data protection regulations and provides for a minimum of eight years of data protection for new chemical entities has been challenged by recent litigation that has favored generic manufacturers the federal government also 

has jurisdiction over international trade and therefore over the issue of crossborder trade in pharmaceuticals and internet pharmacies 

environmental law compliance 

most of our operations are affected by national state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2009 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2009 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

  

 while we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with pending legislation and potential regulation related to climate change we have no reason to believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

we have reviewed the potential for physical risks to our facilities and supply chain that may be exacerbated by climate change and have concluded that because of our facility locations and our existing distribution networks we do not believe these risks are material in the near term 

tax matters 

the discussion of taxrelated matters in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements taxes on income in our 2009 financial report is incorporated by reference 

employees 

in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 116500 people in our operations throughout the world total legacy pfizer headcount was over 74000 while total legacy wyeth headcount was more than 42000 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2009 form 10k and in our 2009 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” “target” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans or prospects in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to substantial risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forwardlooking statements 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k 

reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

health care reform 

both the united states house of representatives and the united states senate have passed bills to implement significant health care reform however negotiations between the senate and the house have not progressed to resolve the differences in the bills it is uncertain at this time whether and when health care reform may be implemented and what form it may take therefore we cannot determine at this time what impact health care reform will have on the company if any for example as the bills stand currently a provision in the senate bill would empower an advisory panel to recommend annual medicare costsaving proposals congress then would be required to consider the proposals on an expedited basis would have limited ability to revise them and if it fails to act the advisory panel’s proposals would be implemented automatically the advisory panel’s costcutting proposals could have a negative effect on our future revenue 

as mentioned above the pharmaceutical industry pledged an 80 billion contribution over 10 years including increased medicaid rebates medicare coverage gap discounts a pathway for follow on biologics and an excise tax of 23 billion annually these costs are not expected to be offset by increased sales from coverage of the uninsured at this time no assurances can be given that health care reform will not have an adverse effect on our revenue in the future 

government regulation and managed care trends 

us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient 

  

access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations in the us many of our biopharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures have increased as the result of the 2003 medicare modernization act due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in addition if the 2003 medicare modernization act were amended to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions it would have a significant adverse impact on our business furthermore mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patientaccess constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising or limitations on interactions with health care professionals and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines 

the prohibition on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of erectile dysfunction medications by the medicaid program which became effective january 1 2006 and the similar federal funding prohibition for the medicare part d program which became effective january 1 2007 has had an adverse effect on our business any prohibitions on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of other classes of drugs in the future may also have an adverse effect 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price 

regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions could also adversely impact revenue 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us around the world upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period which can adversely affect our business 

also the patents covering several of our most important medicines including lipitor caduet detroldetrol la lyrica tygacil zyvox and aricept are being challenged by generic manufacturers in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor began to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with ours including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time competitive product launches have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

dependence on key inline products 

we recorded direct product revenues of more than 1 billion for each of nine legacy pfizer pharmaceutical products in 2009 lipitor norvasc 

  

lyrica celebrex viagra detroldetrol la xalatanxalacom  geodon and zyvox those products accounted for 56 of our total biopharmaceutical revenues in 2009 lipitor sales in 2009 were approximately 114 billion accounting for approximately 25 of our total 2009 biopharmaceutical revenues we did not record more than 1 billion in revenue for any single legacy wyeth product in 2009 since our results do not reflect revenues for legacy wyeth products before the acquisition date of october 15 2009 if the products referenced above or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant for example us revenues for chantix declined in 2009 compared to 2008 following changes to the chantix us label during 2008 and 2009 as noted patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products 

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that have smaller patient populations such as certain types of cancer multiple sclerosis and hiv the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products is beginning to generate significant payer interest in developing cost containment strategies targeted to this sector while the impact on pfizer of payers’ efforts to control access and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has been limited to date our growing portfolio of specialty products combined with the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world and the deteriorating finances of governments may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future

the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are very important to the success of the company however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

risks and uncertainties apply particularly with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products there also are many considerations that can affect marketing of our products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements 

postapproval data 

as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials the results generated in these phase iv trials could result in loss of marketing approval changes in product labeling andor new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 the fdaaa gives the fda enhanced postmarket authority including the explicit authority to require postmarket studies and clinical trials labeling changes based on new safety information and 

  

compliance with fdaapproved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies the fda’s exercise of its authority under the fdaaa could result in delays or increased costs during product development clinical trials and regulatory review increased costs to comply with additional postapproval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable costs postmarketing studies whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect sales of our products further the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate or are perceived to implicate an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of the affected products accordingly new data about our products or products similar to our products could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of our products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of our products 

biotechnology products 

government regulation may in the future allow more permissive approval regimes for biosimilars or “followon biologics” such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products already approved under the us public health service act in the us there is not currently an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilars however legislation to establish such a pathway is being considered by congress additionally the fda has approved a biosimilar recombinant human growth hormone that referenced a biotechnology product approved under the us federal food drug and cosmetic act in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years if competitors are able to obtain marketing 

approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could generally trigger this competition assuming any relevant data exclusivity period has expired we expect that we could face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products with substantial revenue 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results 

interest rate and foreign exchange risk 

57 of our total 2009 revenues were derived from international operations including 29 from the europe region and 16 from the japanasia region these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international net assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management in our 2009 financial report for additional details see note 9e to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2009 financial report those sections of our 2009 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

  

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations also could be affected by capital and exchange controls expropriation and other restrictive government actions changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our products as well as by unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

diversified segment 

our animal health unit may be impacted by continuing global economic weakness resulting in high unemployment rates and tight credit conditions a high unemployment rate typically results in reduced traffic in veterinary clinics negatively impacting our companion animal business tight credit conditions limit the borrowing power of livestock producers causing some to switch to lowerpriced alternatives 

pfizer nutrition may experience significant financial impact associated with changes in national regional and international laws rules and guidelines and their enforcement our infant and young child nutrition products are subject to an array of rules and regulations enforced by government entities as well as treaties conventions and guidelines from international authorities changes to these requirements can significantly impact costs relating to taxes tariffs trade labeling marketing manufacturing and the overall availability of our products 

the consumer healthcare unit may be impacted by economic volatility and generic competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands in addition regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal andor reformulation of certain products eg pseudoephedrine in coughcold products 

global economic conditions 

the global economic downturn in 2009 and the continuing economic weakness has not had nor do we anticipate it will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our significant operating cash flow 

financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as market conditions change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position however there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by recent and possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions 

moreover like other businesses our results have been adversely impacted by and may continue to be adversely impacted by the weak global economy the impact of the weak economy on our biopharmaceutical operations has been largely in the us market affecting products such as lipitor celebrex and lyrica  we believe that patients experiencing the effects of the weak economy including high unemployment levels and facing increases in copays are sometimes switching to generics delaying treatments skipping doses or using less effective treatments to reduce their costs the weak economy has also increased the number of patients in the medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and in many states to formulary restrictions limiting access to brandname drugs including ours our diversified segment has also been impacted by the weak economy which has adversely affected global spending on veterinary care and on personal healthcare products there can be no assurance that our results will not continue to be affected by weak global economic conditions 

difficulties of our wholesale distributors 

in 2009 our largest wholesale distributor accounted for approximately 17 of our total revenue and our top three wholesale distributors accounted for approximately 38 of our total revenue if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with us and we may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our results of operations 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with 

  

demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future results 

cost and expense controlunusual events 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of our costreduction initiatives 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations including changes affecting the taxation by the us of income earned outside the us that may result from pending and possible future proposals competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities environmental and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that 

could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

  

patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations 

business development activities 

we expect to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through acquisitions licensing and alliances see our strategic initiatives—strategy and recent transactions in our 2009 financial report which is incorporated by reference however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities and competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities 

information technology 

we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

failure to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of wyeth 

the success of our recent acquisition of wyeth will depend in large part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from integrating the operations of pfizer and wyeth if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations of the two legacy companies the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected

pharmaceutical 

our pharmaceutical business is the largest pharmaceutical business in the world each year pfizer pharmaceuticals help over 100 million people throughout the world live longer healthier lives with medicines across 11 therapeutic areas we help to treat and prevent many of the most common and most challenging conditions of our time our products are in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases central nervous system disorders arthritis and pain infectious and respiratory diseases urology oncology ophthalmology and endocrine disorders 

in 2008 pharmaceutical revenues of 442 billion were slightly lower than 2007 revenues reflecting the negative impact of the loss of us exclusivity for norvasc march 2007 zyrtec pfizer ceased selling in january 2008 and camptosar february 2008 solid overall performance from our broad portfolio of patentprotected products such as lyrica sutent and celebrex  as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange were able to partially offset these declines revenues from this segment 

  

contributed 915 of our total revenues in 2008 918 of our total revenues in 2007 and 932 in 2006 in 2008 we recorded direct product sales revenues of more than 2 billion for each of lipitor lyrica celebrex and norvasc and more than 1 billion for each of viagra xalatanxalacom detroldetrol la zyvox and geodon a table captioned revenues—major pharmaceutical products in our 2008 financial report is incorporated by reference

 animal health 

our animal health business is one of the largest in the world we discover develop and sell products 

  

for the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock and companion animals in 2008 animal health revenues increased 7 to 28 billion primarily due to the continued performance of key products such as revolutionstronghold draxxin  and other products and the continued success of important new products such as convenia single dose antibiotic for dogs and cats cerenia prevention and treatment of emesis for dogs and improvac boar taint vaccine for pigs 

among the products we market are parasiticides antiinflammatories antibiotics vaccines antiemetics and antiobesity agents including the products discussed above and below 

parasiticides constitute the largest segment of the animal health market for companion animals consisting mainly of medicines for the control of parasites such as fleas and heartworm our product revolutionstronghold is our largestselling parasiticide for dogs and cats 

rimadyl relieves pain and inflammation associated with canine osteoarthritis and soft tissue orthopedic surgery rimadyl is the only arthritis pain medication prescribed by veterinarians available in chewable tablets regular caplets and in an injectable formulation 

clavamoxsynulox is an antibiotic for skin and soft tissue infections in dogs and cats 

our vaccine portfolio for livestock is extensive and includes respisureonestellamuneone a singledose vaccine used to prevent pneumonia in swine and bovishield gold a cattle vaccine for reproductive and respiratory protection in 2008 bovishield gold received approvals for subcutaneous administration for use as a single dose vaccine for the prevention of bovine respiratory syncytial virus infection and for the prevention of persistent infection in calves

research and development 

innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs this goal has been supported by our substantial research and development investments we spent 79 billion in 2008 81 billion in 2007 and 76 billion in 2006 on research and development in support of pfizer’s pharmaceutical and animal health businesses 

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through acquisition licensing or other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from early discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

we believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number of pharmaceutical compounds we have in all stages of development as of yearend 2008 we had 106 projects in 

  

development including 84 new molecular entities and 22 productline extensions in addition we had more than 170 projects in discovery research in recent years our discovery scientists have delivered over 125 new chemical compounds to early development most recently we increased our phase iii portfolio by approximately 60 from 16 to 26 programs at yearend while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering development are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments in our 2008 financial report that information is incorporated by reference 

pfizer provides a detailed update of its pipeline on a twiceyearly basis which is available at wwwpfizercompipeline for tracking development compounds across pfizer’s robust pipeline 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development in addition the consolidation that has occurred in our industry has created companies with substantial research and development resources we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product obsolescence 

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations—pharmaceutical and animal health 

revenues from operations outside the us of 279 billion accounted for 577 of our total revenues in 2008 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 14 countries outside the us in 2008 the us was the only country to contribute more than 

10 of our total revenues comprising 423 of total revenues in 2008 478 of total revenues in 2007 and 534 of total revenues in 2006 japan is our secondlargest national market with 77 of our total revenues in 2008 70 in 2007 and 67 in 2006 

for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues see the table captioned geographic in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and revenue information in our 2008 financial report and the table captioned change in revenues by segment and geographic area in our 2008 financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws on pricing reimbursement and access to our products 

see government regulation and price constraints below for a discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2008 both revenues and net income were favorably impacted by foreign exchange as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar increased our revenues and net income in many countries while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments see the discussion under note 9d to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2008 financial report that discussion is incorporated by reference related information about valuation and risks associated with such financial instruments in parts e and f of that note is also incorporated by reference 

  

marketing 

in our global pharmaceutical business we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos employers and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations our structure aligns the sales marketing and medical functions to work closely in tandem along the same therapeutic groups of products reinforcing common coordination focus and accountability across the organizations 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies we seek to gain access to health authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended approved andor reimbursed medicines and other products we also work with mcos pbms employers and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

our animal health business also uses its own sales organization to promote its products its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to health professionals directly and through veterinary journals animal health products are sold through veterinarians distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users where appropriate these products are also marketed through print and television advertising 

during 2008 sales to our three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers were as follows 

  

  

  

 sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the pharmaceutical segment apart from these instances neither of our business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers 

patents and intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period are those for the drugs set forth in the table below 

  

the table also includes patent expiration information relating to certain recently approved drugs 

 

 in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

the us basic patent for camptosar expired in february 2008 

aricept is patented by eisai co ltd we copromote aricept with eisai in the us and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug in certain other countries 

in addition to our us basic product patent for lipitor which including the pediatric exclusivity period expires in march 2010 we have a patent covering specifically the enantiomeric form of the drug which including the pediatric exclusivity period expires in june 2011 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2008 financial report regarding pending legal challenges to our lipitor patents in the us 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor celebrex and detroldetrol la  in addition a 

company has filed an application with the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of aricept which is patented by eisai co ltd 

we also have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues than most of the products set forth in the table above 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short period in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to overthecounter products 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international and us free trade agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property wtotrips required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005 with an extension until 2016 for leastdeveloped nations a number of countries have made improvements we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in other participant countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our human pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded drugs or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product 

  

categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our pharmaceutical business is the largest in the world our competitors include other worldwide researchbased drug companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases or indications as our major products 

such competition affects our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in research and development over the past decade resulting in one of the strongest product pipelines in the industry our investment in research does not stop with a drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potentially new conditions we protect the health and wellbeing of patients by ensuring that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also continue to enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our pharmaceutical functions including coordinating support for our salespeople’s efforts to launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we recently have taken and continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs for instance we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with and payments to healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

while our animal health business is one of the largest in the world many other companies offer competitive products altogether there are hundreds 

of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include product innovation quality price service and effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 249 million people in the us now participate in some version of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos the marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations continues to grow in importance 

mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing numbers of patients enrolled in mcos at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this consolidation enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers they use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary 

  

considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other restrictions such as requiring prior authorizations can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on most mco formularies 

the impact of mcos on drug prices and volumes has increased as the result of their role in negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit medicare part d that took effect january 1 2006 mcos and pbms negotiate on behalf of the federal government as prescription drug plans pdps we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products that are used by the senior population included on the formularies of the new medicare pdps for 2006 2007 and 2008 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiry generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about our products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the 

innovator product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor began to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary sells generic versions of pfizer’s as well as our competitors’ pharmaceutical products upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2008 and none are expected in 2009 the rise in the price of crude oil has resulted in pricing pressures on raw materials that are derived from petroleum and used in our businesses 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance is the fda in the us it has jurisdiction over our human pharmaceutical business and administers requirements covering the testing 

  

safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda also regulates our animal health products along with the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency 

in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services hhs the federal trade commission and the department of justice individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various regulatory bodies see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2008 financial report such actions may include product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

the us congress and the fda are considering proposals to change how the fda assesses “followon biological” products depending on the specific provisions legislative or regulatory changes that would facilitate the approval of such products could have an adverse impact on the company’s business 

medicare in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 medicare modernization act was enacted medicare beneficiaries are now eligible to obtain subsidized prescription drug coverage from a choice of private sector plans approximately 90 percent of medicare beneficiaries now have coverage for prescription medicines with high levels of beneficiary satisfaction and lowerthanexpected costs to the government and to beneficiaries it remains difficult to predict the longterm impact of the 2003 medicare modernization act on pharmaceutical companies the use of pharmaceuticals has increased slightly among some patients as the result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by coverage under medicare however such expanded utilization has been largely offset by increased pricing pressure and competition 

due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries and by an increase in the use of generic medicines in this population despite the success of medicare part d legislative changes have been proposed to mandate government rebates in medicare and to allow the federal government to directly negotiate prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers it is expected that if legislation were enacted to mandate rebates or provide for direct government negotiation in medicare part d access and reimbursement for our products would be restricted 

pfizer is committed to helping ensure that all americans without coverage for prescription medicines have access to pfizer products to that end in 2004 we implemented our helpful answers program an umbrella program that brings together pfizer’s longstanding patient assistance programs with pfizer pfriends a prescription discount card offering savings on pfizer prescription medicines for all americans without prescription drug coverage regardless of age or income in addition in january 2005 we joined together rx access with nine other pharmaceutical companies to offer savings on over 275 medicines to medicareineligible uninsured individuals under 65 who fall below certain income thresholds pfizer also participates in the partnership for prescription assistance a single point of access to more than 475 public and private patient assistance programs 

importation of drugs there continue to be legislative proposals to amend us law to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs from outside the us which can be sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to well documented safety concerns such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us while the 2003 medicare modernization act maintains a prohibition on such imports it would allow importation from canada if the secretary of hhs certifies that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers before the 2003 medicare modernization act federal law would have permitted importation of medicines into the us from a considerably larger group of developed countries provided the secretary of hhs made the same safety and costsavings certifications 

  

the secretaries of hhs in both the clinton and george w bush administrations declined to certify that importation of medicines is safe and saves money if the new secretary of hhs were to certify that importation is safe and saves money an increase in crossborder trade in medicines subject to foreign price controls in other countries could occur 

in december 2004 hhs and the department of commerce issued reports on drug importation and foreign price controls the hhs report noted that it would be “extraordinarily difficult to ensure that drugs personally imported by individual consumers” could meet the standards of safety that would support certifying such importation as safe while the report also concluded that the us could establish a feasible basis for commercial drug importation such a change in the law would require “new legal authorities substantial additional resources and significant restrictions on the types of drugs that could be imported” the report also noted that the total savings to be expected from such a commercial importation regime would be relatively small—1 or 2 of total drug spending in the us the commerce department report confirmed that the lower prices in many countries result from governmental price controls and these price controls adversely affect the amount of funding that is available for the discovery of new drugs rand health a division of the rand corporation released a study in december 2008 showing that price controls in the us would have a significant negative impact on health in both the us and abroad by deterring the investment that leads to the discovery of new medicines 

medicaid and related matters federal law requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program in recent years various proposals have been offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the medicaid program in the short term driven by budget concerns many states have implemented restrictive drug lists and state supplemental rebate programs under the medicaid program the downturn in state revenues coupled with an anticipated increase in medicaid program enrollment due to a declining economy could cause rebate payments to rise in 2009 the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain medicines to medicaid beneficiaries 

restrictions exist for some pfizer products in certain states access in the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state access may vary by plan however there have been legislative proposals to apply government mandated medicaid rebates to the medicaid managed care program 

effective january 1 2007 changes to the treatment of authorized generics for purposes of calculating medicaid rebates increased the amount of rebates we are required to pay on brand name drug sales after loss of exclusivity and on authorized generic sales to the medicaid program in an effort to increase coverage of the low income uninsured a number of states are also considering expansion of eligibility for their medicaid programs that would result in increased exposure to medicaid rebates though mostly to populations that currently do not have prescription drug coverage 

some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible 

if many states were to require increased rebate payments in discount programs for the uninsured and link medicaid beneficiaries’ access to our products to such discount programs the impact on patients’ access to medicines and on pfizer could be significant 

we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the revenues section of our 2008 financial report and in note 1g to our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies revenues in our 2008 financial report which discussions are incorporated by reference 

marketing restrictions  a number of states are considering programs to control pharmaceutical marketing activities that go beyond commitments made related to adhering to the recently revised and strengthened phrma code for interactions with healthcare professionals if implemented such efforts have the potential to limit appropriate communication activities with healthcare professionals prescribing our medications 

  

health reform massachusetts continues to progress in the implementation of its program for health reform beginning on january 1 2009 health plans participating in the massachusetts program were required to provide a pharmacy benefit however the benefit requirement is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue followon cost containment legislation passed in massachusetts at the end of 2008 including marketing restrictions may also minimize the potential positive of the coverage requirement 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe canada and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices 

the approval of new drugs across the european union eu may only be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissioneuropean medicines agency emea central approval process which applies in the 27 eu member states plus norway and iceland which are full participants in these registration processes the use of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

since the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states we continue to deal with individual countries on such matters across the region 

during 2004 a comprehensive package of reforms was adopted called new medicines legislation amending eu law on the regulation of medicinal products in many areas including approval procedures and safety reporting of particular note the data exclusivity periods during which innovative companies’ regulatory data are protected are required to be harmonized in all member states 

implementation is complete or underway in most member states which will facilitate the approval and launch of generic medicines in addition these reforms introduced a clear legal basis for the approval of “biosimilar” or “followon biological” products in the eu following the effectiveness of these new regulations in november 2005 the first such products including a biosimilar version of genotropin  were approved in the eu in 2006 the new regulations also shortened certain approval timelines and introduced fasttrack and conditional centralized authorizations pfizer’s sutent was the first product to be conditionally approved under the new law in 2006 although its status subsequently was converted to full authorization 

on january 26 2007 the new eu regulation on medicines for pediatric use became effective this introduced new obligations on pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on their medicines for children and subject to various conditions offered the possibility of incentives for so doing including exclusivity extensions the aim of this regulation is to improve the health of children in the eu through high quality research stimulating the development of new medicines creating infrastructure to enable authorized use and improving the information on medicines for children a pediatric committee pdco was created within the emea to provide scientific opinions and input on development plans for medicines for use with children 

on november 28 2007 the eu commission hosted the transatlantic administrative simplification workshop cochaired by the eu commission and the fda in cooperation with the emea and the heads of european medicines agencies to identify opportunities for administrative simplification between the us and the eu in the field of pharmaceutical regulation these opportunities included possible harmonization of administrative practices and guidelines not necessitating changes in regulations while maintaining or increasing the current levels of public health protection by freeing up resources this cooperation will allow the industry to focus more of its resources on developing and supplying medicines to meet the needs of patients 

in canada the federal government controls drug approvals patented drug prices the intellectual property regime and reimbursement focused mainly 

  

on aboriginal canadians health canada is the government agency that provides regulatory and marketing approval for drugs and therapeutic products in october 2006 health canada introduced its modernization initiative under the blueprint for renewal modernizing canada’s regulatory system for health products and food policy framework the blueprint includes ten objectives among which are the progressive licensing framework plf for pharmaceuticals and biologics adopting a product lifecycle approach to regulations stronger postmarket safety and surveillance systems increased transparency and openness emphasis on special populations established the expert advisory committee on pediatrics strengthening compliance and enforcement and moving to an integrated health system closer collaboration and consultation with provinces and territories with respect to access in december 2007 the federal government issued its new food and consumer safety action plan followed by bill c51 april 2008 with proposed legislative amendments to the food and drugs act the bill is expected to be reintroduced in 2009 and if passed would represent a most significant drug regulatory system reform and major change to canada’s drug approval system under the plf health canada is seeking to establish flexibility in the market authorization process that will lead to earlier and more appropriate access for patients to promising therapeutic products as well as focus on best patient outcomes current regulatory policies and initiatives such as priority and conditional approvals are already providing for internationally competitive approval timelines as in the eu sutent was initially approved under the conditional provision furthermore the modernization initiative is proposing the introduction of a regulatory pathway for “biosimilars” referred to as “subsequent entry biologics” which is similar to the “followon biologics” concept in the us 

introductory “nonexcessive” prices and price increases are controlled by the federal patented medicines prices review board canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs which was recently implemented under the data protection regulations and provides for a minimum of eight years of data protection for new chemical entities has been challenged by recent litigation that has favored generic manufacturers the federal government also has jurisdiction over international trade and therefore over the issue of crossborder trade in pharmaceuticals and internet pharmacies 

  

environmental law compliance 

most of our operations are affected by federal state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2008 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2008 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

 

  

 while we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

tax matters 

the discussion of taxrelated matters in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements taxes on income in our 2008 financial report is incorporated by reference 

employees 

in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2008 we employed approximately 81800 people in our operations throughout the world 

 

tablestart 


 i tem 1a risk factors tableend the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2008 form 10k and in our 2008 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set 

  

forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” “target” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans or prospects in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

  

government regulation and managed care trends 

us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations in the us many of our pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures have increased as the result of the 2003 medicare modernization act due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in addition if the 2003 medicare modernization act were amended to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions it would have a significant adverse impact on our business in addition mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patientaccess constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries restrictions on us directtoconsumer advertising or limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products 

the prohibition on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of ed medications by the medicaid program which became effective january 1 2006 and the similar federal funding prohibition for the medicare part d program which became effective january 1 2007 has had an adverse effect on our business any prohibitions on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of other classes of drugs in the future may also have an adverse effect 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and 

  

regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us around the world upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period which can adversely affect our business for example the us basic patent for camptosar expired in february 2008 

also the patents covering several of our most important medicines including lipitor celebrex detroldetrol la and aricept are being challenged by generic manufacturers in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor began to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with our drugs including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time launches of a number of competitive products have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

  

dependence on key inline and new products 

we recorded direct product revenues of more than 1 billion for each of nine pharmaceutical products in 2008 lipitor norvasc lyrica celebrex viagra detroldetrol la xalatanxalacom  geodon and zyvox those products accounted for 60 of our total pharmaceutical revenues in 2008 lipitor sales in 2008 were approximately 124 billion accounting for 28 of our total 2008 pharmaceutical revenues if the other products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from existing competitive products changes in labeling or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant for example us revenues for chantix declined significantly in 2008 compared to 2007 following changes to the chantix us label during 2008 as noted patents covering several of our bestselling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products including selzentrycelsentri and toviaz  

specialty pharmaceuticals 

specialty pharmaceuticals refer to medicines that treat rare or lifethreatening conditions that have smaller patient populations such as certain types of cancer multiple sclerosis and hiv the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products is beginning to generate significant payer interest in developing cost containment strategies targeted to this sector while the impact on pfizer of payers’ efforts to control access and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has been limited to date the company’s growing portfolio of specialty products combined with the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world and the deteriorating finances of governments may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future 

  

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products are very important to the success of the company however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

risks and uncertainties apply particularly with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products there also are many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results 

  

interest rate and foreign exchange risk 

58 of our total 2008 revenues was derived from international operations including 31 from the europe region and 15 from the japanasia region these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international net assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management in our 2008 financial report for additional details see note 9d to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2008 financial report those sections of our 2008 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations also could be affected by changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of products as well as by unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

global economic conditions 

the recent changes in global financial markets have not had nor do we anticipate they will have a significant impact on our liquidity due to our significant operating cash flow financial assets access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future as market conditions change we will continue to monitor our liquidity position however there can be no assurance that our liquidity or our results of operations will not be affected by recent and possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions 

  

moreover like other businesses we face the potential effects of the global economic recession unprecedented market conditions including illiquid credit markets volatile equity markets dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency rates and economic recession could affect future results 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future results 

cost and expense controlunusual events 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of our costreduction initiatives 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities environmental and tax 

litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations 

business development activities 

we plan to continue to enhance our inline products and product pipeline through acquisitions licensing and alliances see regulatory environment and pipeline productivity under our operating environment and response to key opportunities and challenges in our 2008 financial report which is incorporated by reference however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities and competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities 

information technology 

we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested heavily in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

  

risk factors related to the proposed wyeth acquisition 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

the success of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of pfizer and wyeth however to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings we must successfully combine the businesses of pfizer and wyeth if we are not able to achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

pfizer and wyeth have operated and until the completion of the acquisition will continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers distributors creditors lessors clinical trial investigators or managers of its clinical trials or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of wyeth and pfizer during such transition period 

failure to complete the acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results  

if the acquisition is not completed or our financing for the transaction becomes unavailable our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

  

   

 we could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition if the acquisition is not completed these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business financial results and stock price 

the required regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may contain materially burdensome conditions that could have an adverse effect on us 

completion of the acquisition is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental approvals including without limitation the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino act the issuance by the european commission of a decision under the ec merger regulation declaring the acquisition compatible with the common market the approval of the acquisition under the china antimonopoly law and the approval of the acquisition by the antitrust regulators in canada and australia although pfizer and wyeth have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained in addition the governmental authorities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition or require changes to the terms of the acquisition under the terms of the merger agreement we are required if necessary to receive antitrust approval to make divestitures of assets so long as such divestitures would not result in the oneyear loss of net sales measured by net 2008 sales revenue in excess of 3 billion if we become subject to any material conditions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the acquisition our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we will take on substantial additional indebtedness to finance the acquisition 

upon completion of the acquisition we will increase our indebtedness which will include acquisition debt financing of approximately 225 billion and the assumption of wyeth’s debt 

  

obligations the financial and other covenants that we agree to in connection with such indebtedness and our increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio in comparison to that of pfizer on a recent historical basis could among other things reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increase our borrowing costs 

we will incur significant transaction and acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the acquisition 

we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with integrating the operations of wyeth the substantial majority of nonrecurring expenses resulting from the acquisition will be comprised of transaction costs related to the acquisition facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment—related costs we will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of wyeth’s business although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to more than offset incremental transaction and acquisitionrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

the merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may harm the market price of our common stock 

we currently anticipate that the merger will be accretive to earnings per share during the calendar year 2011 this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change after the completion of the merger we could also encounter additional transaction and integrationrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock 

  

charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the merger 

in accordance with us gaap we will be considered the acquirer for accounting purposes we will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting which will result in charges to our earnings that could adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the completion of the merger under the purchase method of accounting we will allocate the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from wyeth based on their fair values as of the date of the completion of the merger and record any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill for certain tangible and intangible assets reevaluating their fair values as of the completion date of the merger will result in our incurring additional depreciation andor amortization expense that exceed the combined amounts recorded by pfizer and wyeth prior to the merger this increased expense will be recorded by us over the useful lives of the underlying assets in addition to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets were to become impaired we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

wyeth faces litigation risks and is the subject of various legal proceedings 

if we consummate our acquisition of wyeth we will assume wyeth’s risks arising from legal proceedings like all pharmaceutical companies in the current legal environment wyeth is involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities environmental and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of wyeth’s pending or future legal proceedings and the ultimate outcome of such matters could be material to our results of operations cash flows and financial condition

innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs this goal has been supported by our substantial research and development investments we spent 81 billion in 2007 76 billion in 2006 and 73 billion in 2005 on research and development in support of pfizer’s pharmaceutical and animal health businesses 

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through acquisition licensing or other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from early discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

we believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number of pharmaceutical compounds we have in all stages of development we currently are working on 213 projects in development including 151 new molecular entities and 62 productline extensions in addition we have more than 300 projects in discovery research in recent years our discovery scientists have delivered over 100 new chemical compounds to early development while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering development are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments in our 2007 financial report that information is incorporated by reference 

pfizer provides a detailed update of its pipeline twice a year which is available at wwwpfizercompipeline for tracking development compounds across pfizer’s robust pipeline 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development in addition the consolidation that has occurred in our industry has created companies with substantial research and development resources we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product obsolescence 

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations —pharmaceutical and animal health 

revenues from operations outside the us of 253 billion accounted for 522 of our total revenues in 2007 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 12 countries outside the us in 

2007 the us was the only country to contribute more than 10 of our total revenues comprising 478 of total revenues in 2007 534 of total revenues in 2006 and 522 of total revenues in 2005 japan is our secondlargest national market with 70 of our total revenues in 2007 67 in 2006 and 73 in 2005 

for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues see the table captioned geographic in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and revenue information in our 2007 financial report and the table captioned change in revenues by segment and geographic area in our 2007 financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws on pricing reimbursement and access to our products 

see government regulation and price constraints below for discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2007 both revenues and net income were favorably impacted by foreign exchange as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar increased our revenues and net income in many countries while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments see the discussion under note 10d to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2007 financial report that discussion is incorporated by reference related information about valuation and risks associated with such financial instruments in parts e and f of that note is also incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global pharmaceutical business we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos employers and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs 

our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations our structure aligns the sales marketing and medical functions to work closely in tandem along the same therapeutic groups of products reinforcing common coordination focus and accountability across the organizations 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies we seek to gain access to health authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended approved andor reimbursed medicines and other products we also work with mcos pbms employers and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines 

our animal health business also uses its own sales organization to promote its products its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to health professionals directly and through veterinary journals animal health products are sold through veterinarians distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users where appropriate these products are also marketed through print and television advertising 

during 2007 sales to our three largest wholesalers were as follows 

mckesson inc—18 of our total revenues cardinal health inc—12 of our total revenues and amerisourcebergen corporation—10 of our total revenues sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the pharmaceutical segment apart from these instances neither of our business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers 

patents and intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period are those for the drugs set forth in the table below the table 

also includes patent expiration information relating to certain recently approved drugs 

 in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

the us basic patents expired for zyrteczyrtec d and norvasc in 2007 and for camptosar in february 2008 

aricept is patented by eisai co ltd we copromote aricept with eisai in the us and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug in certain other countries 

in addition to our us basic product patent for lipitor which including the pediatric exclusivity period expires in march 2010 we have a patent covering specifically the enantiomeric form of the drug which including the pediatric exclusivity period expires in june 2011 see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2007 financial report regarding pending legal challenges to our lipitor patents in the us and canada 

we market genotropin in the us under a nonexclusive license from novonordisk 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor celebrex detroldetrol la and caduet  in addition a company has filed an application with the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of aricept which is patented by eisai co ltd 

we also have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues than most of the products set forth in the table above 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short period in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to overthecounter products 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights is improving the general agreement on tariffs and trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a tenyear transition period a number of countries are doing this we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our human pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded drugs or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our pharmaceutical business is the largest in the world our competitors include other worldwide researchbased drug companies 

smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases or indications as our major products 

such competition affects our core product business focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in research and development over the past decade resulting in one of the strongest product pipelines in the industry our investment in research does not stop with a drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potentially new conditions we protect the health and well being of patients by ensuring that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients physicians and global health authorities we also continue to enhance the organizational effectiveness of our pharmaceutical sales and marketing functions coordinating support for our salespeople’s efforts to launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we recently have taken and continue to take measures to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs 

for instance we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to us directtoconsumer advertising interactions with healthcare professionals and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions 

while our animal health business is one of the largest in the world many other companies offer competitive products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include product 

innovation quality price service and effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 180 million people in the us now participate in some version of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations continues to grow in importance 

mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has been increasing in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers they use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment 

of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other restrictions such as requiring prior authorizations can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on most mco formularies 

the impact of mcos on drug prices and volumes has increased as the result of their role in negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit medicare part d that took effect january 1 2006 mcos and pbms negotiate on behalf of the federal government as prescription drug plans pdps we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products that are used by the senior population included on the formularies of the new medicare pdps for 2006 2007 and 2008 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiry generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about our products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the bloodstream equivalent 

to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor began to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary sells generic versions of pfizer’s pharmaceutical products upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2007 and none are expected in 2008 the rise in the price of crude oil has resulted in pricing pressures on raw materials that are derived from petroleum and used in our businesses 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance is the fda in the us it has jurisdiction over our human pharmaceutical business and administers 

requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda also regulates our animal health products along with the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency 

in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services the federal trade commission and the department of justice individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various regulatory bodies see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2007 financial report such actions may include product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

the us congress and the fda are considering proposals to change how the fda assesses “followon biological” products depending on the specific provisions legislative or regulatory changes that would facilitate the approval of such products could have an adverse impact on the company’s business 

medicare in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 medicare act was enacted medicare beneficiaries are now eligible to obtain subsidized prescription drug coverage from a choice of private sector plans over 90 percent of medicare beneficiaries now have coverage for prescription medicines it remains difficult to predict the longterm impact of the 2003 medicare act on pharmaceutical companies the use of pharmaceuticals has increased slightly among some patients as the result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by coverage under medicare however such expanded utilization has been largely offset by increased pricing pressure and competition due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries and by an increase in the use of 

generic medicines in this population in addition effective january 1 2007 medicare ended reimbursement for ed medicines including 

viagra  

pfizer is committed to helping ensure that all americans without coverage for prescription medicines have access to pfizer products to that end in 2004 we implemented our helpful answers program an umbrella program that brings together pfizer’s longstanding patient assistance programs with pfizer pfriends a prescription discount card offering savings on pfizer prescription medicines for all americans without prescription drug coverage regardless of age or income in addition in january 2005 we joined together rx access with nine other pharmaceutical companies to offer savings on over 275 medicines to medicareineligible uninsured individuals under 65 who fall below certain income thresholds pfizer also participates in the partnership for prescription assistance a single point of access to more than 475 public and private patient assistance programs 

importation of drugs there continue to be legislative proposals to amend us law to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs from outside the us which can be sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to well documented safety concerns such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us while the 2003 medicare act maintains the current prohibition on such imports it would allow importation from canada if the secretary of health and human services certifies that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers before the 2003 medicare act federal law would have permitted importation of medicines into the us from a considerably larger group of developed countries provided the secretary of health and human services made the same safety and costsavings certifications in december 2004 the department of health and human services hhs and the department of commerce issued reports on drug importation and foreign price controls the hhs report noted that it would be “extraordinarily difficult to ensure that drugs personally imported by individual consumers” could meet the standards of safety that would support certifying such importation as safe while the report also concluded that the us could 

establish a feasible basis for commercial drug importation such a change in the law would require “new legal authorities substantial additional resources and significant restrictions on the types of drugs that could be imported” the report also noted that the total savings to be expected from such a commercial importation regime would be relatively small — 1 or 2 of total drug spending in the us the commerce department report confirmed that the lower prices in many countries result from governmental price controls and these price controls adversely affect the amount of funding that is available for the discovery of new drugs 

medicaid and related matters federal law requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program in recent years various proposals have been offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the medicaid program in the short term driven by budget concerns many states have implemented restrictive drug lists and state supplemental rebate programs under the medicaid program these programs increased our required rebate payments in 2007 nonetheless pfizer enjoys relatively broad formulary access in state medicaid feeforservice programs although restrictions exist for some products in certain states access in the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state access may vary by plan 

since january 1 2006 federal funds have not been used for reimbursement of erectile dysfunction medications including viagra in the medicaid program in addition effective january 1 2007 changes to the treatment of authorized generics for purposes of calculating medicaid rebates increased the amount of rebates we are required to pay on brand name drug sales after loss of exclusivity and on authorized generic sales to the medicaid program in addition a number of states are considering expansion of eligibility for their medicaid programs that would result in increased exposure to medicaid rebates 

some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible as 

well as various approaches to controlling pharmaceutical marketing activities if many states were to require increased rebate payments in discount programs for the uninsured and link medicaid beneficiaries’ access to our products to such discount programs the impact on patients’ access to medicines and on pfizer could be significant 

we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the revenues section of our 2007 financial report and in note 1g to our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies revenues in our 2007 financial report which discussions are incorporated by reference 

health reform massachusetts is currently implementing its program for health reform part of the ongoing implementation discussion is whether minimal coverage requires access to brandname medications or only to generic medications the latter approach has the potential to have a negative impact on the sale of brandname medications this impact would be more significant if genericsonly programs were implemented by other states considering their own approaches to health reform 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices 

the approval of new drugs across the eu may only be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissioneuropean medicines agency emea central approval process which applies in the 27 eu member states plus norway and 

iceland which are full participants in these registration processes the use of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

since the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states we continue to deal with individual countries on such matters across the region 

during 2004 a comprehensive package of reforms was adopted called new medicines legislation amending eu law on the regulation of medicinal products in many areas including approval procedures and safety reporting of particular note the data exclusivity periods during which innovative companies’ regulatory data are protected are required to be harmonized in all member states implementation is complete or underway in most member states which will facilitate the approval and launch of generic medicines in addition these reforms introduced a clear legal basis for the approval of “biosimilar” or “followon biological” products in the eu following the effectiveness of these new regulations in november 2005 the first such products including a biosimilar version of genotropin  were approved in the eu in 2006 the new regulations also shortened certain approval timelines and introduced fasttrack and conditional centralized authorizations pfizer’s sutent was the first product to be conditionally approved under the new law in 2006 although its status subsequently was converted to full authorization 

on january 26 2007 the new eu regulation on medicines for pediatric use became effective this introduced new obligations on pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on their medicines in children and subject to various conditions offers the possibility of incentives for so doing including exclusivity extensions the aim of this new regulation is to improve the health of children in the eu through high quality research stimulating the development of new medicines creating infrastructure to enable authorized use and improving the information on medicines for children a pediatric committee pdco was created within the emea to provide scientific opinions and input on development plans for medicines for use with children 

on november 28 2007 the eu commission hosted the transatlantic administrative simplification workshop cochaired by the eu commission and the fda in cooperation with the emea and the heads of european medicines agencies to identify opportunities for administrative simplification between the us and the eu in the field of pharmaceutical regulation these opportunities include possible harmonization of administrative practices and guidelines not necessitating changes in regulations while maintaining or increasing the current levels of public health protection by freeing up resources this cooperation will allow the industry to focus more of its resources on developing and supplying medicines to meet the needs of patients 

environmental law compliance 

most of our operations are affected by federal state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2007 financial report 

as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2007 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

environmentrelated capital expenditures — 64 million other environmentrelated expenses — 178 million while we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

tax matters 

the discussion of taxrelated matters in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements taxes on income in our 2007 financial report is incorporated by reference 

employees 

in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2007 we employed approximately 86600 people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a risk factors and cautionary factors that may affect future results 

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2007 form 10k and in our 2007 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” “target” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans or prospects in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could 

differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

government regulation and managed care trends 

us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations in the us many of our pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures have increased as the result of the 2003 medicare act due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in addition if the 2003 medicare act were amended to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions it would have a significant adverse impact on our business in addition mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patientaccess constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or 

regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including changes in patent laws the importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries and restrictions on us directto consumer advertising or limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals 

the prohibition on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of ed medications by the medicaid program which became effective january 1 2006 and the similar federal funding prohibition for the medicare program which became effective january 1 2007 has had an adverse effect on our business any prohibitions on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of other classes of drugs in the future may also have an adverse effect 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us around the world upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period which can adversely affect our business the us basic patent for norvasc expired in 2007 and a generic version was launched promptly the us basic patent for zyrteczyrtec d expired in december 2007 and an overthecounter version was launched in late january 2008 by the purchaser of 

our consumer healthcare business the us basic patent for camptosar expired in february 2008 also the patents covering several of our most important medicines including lipitor celebrex detroldetrol la caduet and aricept are being challenged by generic manufacturers in addition our patentprotected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor began to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with our drugs including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time launches of a number of competitive products have occurred in recent years and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

dependence on key inline and new products 

we recorded product sales of more than 1 billion for each of eight pharmaceutical products in 2007 lipitor norvasc lyrica celebrex viagra detroldetrol la xalatanxalacom and zyrteczyrtec d  those products accounted for 580 of our total pharmaceutical revenues in 2007 lipitor sales in 2007 were approximately 127 billion accounting for 284 of our total 2007 pharmaceutical revenues the us basic patents for norvasc and zyrteczyrtec d expired in 2007 if the other six products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from existing competitive products or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant as noted patents covering several of our bestselling 

medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products including lyrica sutent chantixchampix and selzentrycelsentri  

uncertainty relating to cox2 medicines 

our ability to further increase celebrex sales may be limited by the continuing concern about the safety of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory pain relievers 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products is very important to the success of the company however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

risks and uncertainties apply particularly with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products there also are many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are 

a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results 

interest rate and foreign exchange risk 

522 of our total 2007 revenues were derived from international operations including 329 from the europecanada region and 134 from the japanasia region these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international net assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management in our 2007 financial report for additional details see note 10d to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2007 financial report those sections of our 2007 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations also could be affected by changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and 

procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of products as well as by unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future results 

cost and expense controlunusual events 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of our costreduction initiatives 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities environmental and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations 

business development activities 

we plan to enhance our product pipeline through acquisitions licensing and alliances see regulatory environment and pipeline productivity under our operating environment and response to key opportunities and challenges in our 2007 financial report which section is incorporated by reference however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities and competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities 

information technology 

we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested heavily in protection of data and 

information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business

research and product development 

innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs this goal has been supported by our substantial research and development investments we spent 76 billion in 2006 73 billion in 2005 and 75 billion in 2004 on research and development in support of pfizer’s pharmaceutical and animal health businesses 

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through acquisition licensing or other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from early discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

we believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number of pharmaceutical compounds we have in all stages of development we currently are working on 249 projects in development including 177 new molecular entities and 72 productline extensions in addition we have more than 350 projects in discovery research in recent years our discovery scientists have delivered over 100 new chemical compounds to early development while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering development are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments in our 2006 financial report that information is incorporated by reference 

pfizer recently provided more detail on its pipeline than ever before with the launch of an online site for tracking development compounds across pfizer’s largestever pipeline this new website launched in december 2006 will be updated twice a year and is available at httpwwwpfizercompipeline 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development in addition the consolidation that has occurred in our industry has created companies with substantial research and development resources we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product obsolescence 

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations pharmaceutical and animal health 

revenues from operations outside the us of 225 billion accounted for 466 of our total revenues in 2006 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 10 countries outside the us in 2006 the us was the only country to contribute more than 10 of our total revenues comprising 534 of total revenues in 2006 522 of total revenues in 2005 and 567 of total revenues in 2004 japan is our secondlargest national market with 67 of our revenues in 2006 73 in 2005 and 64 in 2004 

for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues see the table captioned geographic in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and revenue information in our 2006 financial report and the table captioned change in revenues by segment and geographic area in our 2006 financial report those tables are incorporated by reference 

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws on pricing reimbursement and access to our products 

see government regulation and price constraints below for discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2006 revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar decreased our reported revenues in many countries while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments see the discussion under note 9d to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2006 financial report that discussion is incorporated by reference related information about valuation and risks associated with such financial instruments in parts e and f of that same note is also incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global pharmaceutical business we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer print and television advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs in all major markets 

our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations our structure aligns the sales marketing and medical functions to work closely in tandem along the same therapeutic groups of products reinforcing common coordination focus and accountability across the organizations 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies we seek to gain access to health authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended approved andor reimbursed medicines and other products by demonstrating the clinical and economic value of our products we also work with mcos and pbms and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines in 2005 for instance we were awarded a center for medicaremedicaid studies “cms” contract to provide the green ribbon health initiative a jointpartnership with the mco 

humana designed to improve the health and quality of life for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions in central florida 

our animal health business also uses its own sales organization to promote its products its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to health professionals directly and through veterinary journals animal health products are sold through veterinarians distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users where appropriate these products are also marketed through print and television advertising 

during 2006 sales to our three largest customers were as follows 

mckesson inc—20 of our total revenues cardinal health inc—13 of our total revenues and amerisourcebergen corporation—11 of our total revenues sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the pharmaceutical segment apart from these instances neither of our business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers 

patents and intellectual property rights 

our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 

we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing 

patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period are those for the drugs set forth in the table below the table also includes patent expiration information relating to certain recently approved drugs 

 in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent 

the us basic product patent for zoloft expired in june 2006 and for zithromax in november 2005 

zyrtec is patented by the belgian company ucb sa and is licensed to us for sales in the us we copromote zyrtec as a prescription medicine in the us with a subsidiary of ucb sa the us basic patent for zyrtec expires in december 2007 

aricept is patented by eisai co ltd we copromote aricept with eisai in the us and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug in certain other countries 

in addition to our us basic product patent for lipitor which including the pediatric exclusivity period expires in march 2010 we have a patent covering specifically the enantiomeric form of the drug which including the pediatric exclusivity period expires in june 2011 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2006 financial report regarding a pending legal challenge to our lipitor patents in the us 

we market genotropin in the us under a nonexclusive license from novonordisk 

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor norvasc celebrex and detrol  

we also have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short period in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to overthecounter products 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights is improving the general agreement on tariffs and trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a tenyear transition period a number of countries are doing this we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our human pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded drugs or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our pharmaceutical business is the largest in the world our competitors include other worldwide researchbased drug companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases or indications as our major products 

such competition affects our core product innovation business focused on discovering and marketing products that satisfy unmet medical needs and providing therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in research and development over the past decade resulting in one of the strongest product pipelines in the industry our investment in research does not stop with a drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat as well as potentially new conditions we also continue to enhance the organizational effectiveness of our pharmaceutical sales and marketing functions coordinating support for our salespeople’s efforts to launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we are taking important measures to address this business environment including the reduction of our us sales force by 20 completed in december 2006 the ongoing reduction of our european sales force by more than 20 subject to consultation with works councils and local labor laws and the restructuring of our us pharmaceutical operations into four business units to create a more focused and entrepreneurial 

environment with a fifth business unit to be responsible for customer support and specifically focused on managed care and access we continue to evaluate adapt and improve our business practices to better meet customer and public needs for instance we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to directtoconsumer advertising and medical education grants we also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through campaigns for better healthcare solutions 

while our animal health business is one of the largest in the world many other companies offer competitive products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include product innovation quality price service and effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 180 million people in the us now participate in some version of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations continues to grow in importance 

mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has been increasing in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers they use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

as discussed above in marketing mcos and pbms typically develop formularies formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other restrictions such as requiring prior authorizations can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on most mco formularies 

the impact of mcos on drug prices and volumes may increase as the result of their role in negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the new medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit medicare part d that took effect january 1 2006 mcos and pbms negotiate on behalf of the federal government as prescription drug plans pdps we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products that are used by the senior population included on the formularies of the new medicare pdps for both 2006 and 2007 

another way we demonstrate the value of pharmaceuticals in the context of an appropriate approach to the management of healthcare is by developing disease management programs these programs can improve patient care by improving patient communications and compliance with dosage directions they can also help show that a comprehensive approach to healthcare management which includes prevention diagnosis and treatment of certain conditions and appropriate use of pharmaceuticals can improve the quality of care and lower costly complications of chronic diseases as noted above in marketing we developed a new company green ribbon health with the mco humana to provide medicare health support services under a contract with cms the services are designed to improve the health and quality of life for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions in central florida additionally beginning in 2001 we contracted with the state of florida agency for health care administration to help manage chronic diseases among florida’s medicaid population that program was expanded in 2006 under a new contract pfizer was awarded by florida medicaid to provide comprehensive disease management programs for a larger scope of chronically ill beneficiaries through 2009 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiry generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about our products to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor began to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary sells generic versions of pfizer’s pharmaceutical products upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2006 and none are expected in 2007 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance is the fda in the us it has jurisdiction over our human pharmaceutical business and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda also regulates our animal health products along with the us 

department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency 

in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services the federal trade commission and the department of justice individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various regulatory bodies see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2006 financial report such actions may include product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

the us congress and the fda are considering proposals to change how the fda assesses “followon biological” products changes that would facilitate the approval of such products could have an adverse impact on the company’s business 

medicare in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 medicare act was enacted medicare beneficiaries are now eligible to obtain subsidized prescription drug coverage from a choice of private sector plans it remains difficult to predict the longterm impact of the 2003 medicare act on pharmaceutical companies usage of pharmaceuticals is likely to increase as the result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by coverage under medicare however such expanded utilization may be offset by the increased pricing pressure and competition due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in addition effective january 1 2007 medicare ended reimbursement for ed medicines including viagra  

pfizer is committed to helping ensure that all americans without coverage for prescription medicines have access to pfizer products to that end in 2004 we implemented our helpful answers program an umbrella program that brings together pfizer’s longstanding patient assistance programs with pfizer pfriends a new prescription discount card offering savings on pfizer prescription medicines for all americans without prescription drug coverage regardless of age or income in addition in january 2005 we joined together rx access with nine other pharmaceutical companies to offer savings on over 275 medicines to medicareineligible uninsured individuals under 65 who fall below certain income thresholds pfizer also participates in the partnership for prescription assistance a single point of access to more than 475 public and private patient assistance programs 

importation of drugs there continue to be legislative proposals to amend us law to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs from outside the us which can be sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to well documented safety concerns such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us while the 2003 medicare act maintains the current prohibition on such imports it would allow importation from canada if the secretary of health and human services certifies that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers before the 2003 medicare act federal law would have permitted importation of medicines into the us from a considerably larger group of developed countries provided the secretary of health and human services made the same safety and costsavings certifications in december 2004 the department of health and human services hhs and the department of commerce issued reports on drug importation and foreign price controls the hhs report noted that it would be “extraordinarily difficult to ensure that drugs personally imported by individual consumers” could meet the standards of safety that would support certifying such importation as safe while the report also concluded that the us could establish a feasible basis for commercial drug importation such a change in the law would require “new legal authorities substantial additional resources and significant restrictions on the types of drugs that could be imported” the report also noted that the total savings to be expected from such a commercial importation regime would be relatively small — 1 or 2 of total drug spending in the us the commerce department report confirmed that the lower prices in many countries result from governmental price 

controls and these price controls adversely affect the amount of funding that is available for the discovery of new drugs 

medicaid and related matters federal law requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program in recent years various proposals have been offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the medicaid program a national commission recently released a list of recommended reforms in the medicaid program although the fate of those reforms is very uncertain in the current congress in the short term driven by budget concerns many states have implemented restrictive drug lists and state supplemental rebate programs under the medicaid program these programs require deeper rebate payments by pfizer in order to have our products listed on formularies in states with such rebate programs more than 40 states have implemented some form of formulary restrictions in their medicaid programs currently pfizer enjoys relatively broad formulary access in state medicaid programs 

since january 1 2006 federal funds have not been used for reimbursement of erectile dysfunction medications including viagra in the medicaid program in addition effective january 1 2007 changes to treatment of authorized generics for purposes of calculating medicaid rebates will increase the amount of rebates we are required to pay on brand name drug sales after loss of exclusivity and on authorized generic sales to the medicaid program changes implemented under the medicaid program prior to 2006 that further restrict the access of a significant number of patients to our products and require significantly deeper rebate payments are being mitigated by the shrinking size of the medicaid drug program those people who are eligible for both medicaid and medicare often called “dual eligibles” had been receiving their drug benefits under the medicaid program beginning in 2006 their coverage was transferred to the new medicare part d program this reduced the number of enrollees in medicaid drug programs the size of the medicaid drug program and its impact on our business while the medicaid market is now smaller changes at the state level could impact larger federal and commercial accounts 

in addition some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible as well as various approaches to controlling pharmaceutical marketing activities a stateadministered pharmacy discount program was enacted by the state of california during 2006 that has potential impact on access and reimbursement for our products in the medcal program the fate of this new discount card program is uncertain given the federal government’s previous concerns about programs with similar structures moreover full implementation of the california program even if it were approved by the federal government is several years away however if many states were to require steep rebate payments in discount programs for the uninsured and to link medicaid beneficiaries’ access to our products to such discount programs the impact on patients’ access to medicines and on pfizer could be significant 

we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the revenues section of our 2006 financial report and in note 1g to our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies revenues in our 2006 financial report which discussions are incorporated by reference 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices 

the approval of new drugs across the eu may only be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissionemea’s central approval process which applies in the now 27 eu member states 

since bulgaria and romania joined on january 1 2007 plus norway and iceland which are full participants in these registration processes the use of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

since the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states we continue to deal with individual countries on such matters across the region 

during 2004 a comprehensive package of reforms was adopted called new medicines legislation amending eu law on the regulation of medicinal products in many areas including approval procedures and safety reporting of particular note the data exclusivity periods during which innovative companies’ regulatory data are protected are required to be harmonized in all member states and implementation is complete or underway in most member states which will facilitate the approval and launch of generic medicines in addition these reforms introduced a clear legal basis for the approval of “biosimilar” or “followon biological” products in the eu following the effectiveness of these new regulations in november 2005 the first such products including a biosimilar version of genotropin were approved in the eu in 2006 the new regulations also shortened certain approval timelines and introduced fasttrack and conditional centralized authorizations pfizer’s sutent was the first product to be conditionally approved under the new law in 2006 although its status has now converted to full authorization 

more recently on january 26 2007 the new eu regulation on medicines for pediatric use became effective this introduces new obligations on pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on their medicines in children and subject to various conditions offers the possibility of incentives for so doing including exclusivity extensions 

environmental law compliance 

most of our operations are affected by federal state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2006 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2006 for environmental compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

environmentrelated capital expenditures — 47 million other environmentrelated expenses — 206 million   while we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

tax matters 

the discussion of taxrelated matters in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements taxes on income in our 2006 financial report is incorporated by reference 

employees 

in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 98000 people in our operations throughout the world on january 22 2007 the company announced as a part of its priorities to drive improved performance position the company for future success and enhance total shareholder return a plan to eliminate about 10000 positions or about 10 of pfizer’s worldwide workforce by the end of 2008 




 item 1a risk factors and cautionary factors that may affect future results 

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2006 form 10k and in our 2006 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as“anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” “target” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans or prospects in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

government regulation and managed care trends 

us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations in the us many of our pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures may increase as the result of the 2003 medicare act due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector plans that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in addition if the 2003 medicare act were amended to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions it would have a significant adverse impact on our business in addition mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patientaccess constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including the importation of prescription drugs that are marketed from outside the us at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries 

the prohibition on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of ed medications by the medicaid program which became effective january 1 2006 and the similar federal funding prohibition for the 

medicare program which became effective january 1 2007 may adversely affect our business any prohibitions on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of other classes of drugs in the future may also have an adverse effect 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us around the world upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period which can adversely affect our business the us basic patent for zoloft expired in 2006 and will expire in 2007 for each of norvasc and zyrtec  generic versions of zoloft were launched in 2006 and we expect generic versions of norvasc and zyrtec to be launched in 2007 the us basic patents on camptosar and inspra expire in 2008 also the patents covering several of our most important medicines including lipitor norvasc celebrex detrol and caduet are being challenged by generic manufacturers in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor began to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

in 2006 the fda approved a new branded somatropin product that will compete with genotropin 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with our drugs including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time launches of a number of competitive products have occurred recently and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

dependence on key inline and new products 

we recorded product sales of more than 1 billion for each of nine pharmaceutical products in 2006 lipitor norvasc zoloft lyrica celebrex viagra detroldetrol la xalatanxalacom and zyrtec those products accounted for 64 of our pharmaceutical revenues in 2006 lipitor sales in 2006 were approximately 129 billion accounting for 286 of our total 2006 pharmaceutical revenues if these or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from existing competitive products or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant as noted patents covering several of our bestselling medicines recently have expired or will expire this year or next year and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products including lyrica exubera sutent chantix champix and eraxis  

uncertainty relating to cox2 medicines 

our ability to increase celebrex sales may be limited by the continuing concern about the safety of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory pain relievers 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products is very important to the success of the company however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products there also are many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results 

interest rate and foreign exchange risk 

466 of our total 2006 revenues were derived from international operations including 293 from the europecanada region and 123 from the japanasia region these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management in our 2006 financial report for additional details see note 9d to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities — foreign exchange risk in our 2006 financial report those sections of our 2006 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations also could be affected by changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of products as well as by unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future results 

cost and expense controlunusual events 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to realize the projected benefits of our adapting to scale multiyear productivity initiative including the projected benefits of the broadening of this initiative over the next few years 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities environmental and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations 

business development activities 

we plan to enhance our pipeline through acquisitions licensing and alliances see regulatory environment and pipeline productivity under overview of our performance and operating environment in our 2006 financial report which section is incorporated by reference however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities

research and product development 

innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs this goal has been supported by our substantial research and development investments we spent 74 billion in 2005 77 billion in 2004 and 75 billion in 2003 

on research and development in support of pfizer’s human animal and consumer healthcare businesses 

we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through acquisition licensing or other arrangements 

drug discovery and development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from early discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research 

we believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number of pharmaceutical compounds we have in all stages of development we currently are working on 235 projects in development including 152 new molecular entities and 83 productline extensions in addition we have more than 400 projects in discovery research in recent years our discovery scientists have delivered dozens of new chemical compounds to early development while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering development are the foundation for future products 

in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them in 2005 for example we received approval for a new indication for our cox2 inhibitor celebrex for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis a form of arthritis that affects the spine we also received approval for the use of lipitor to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes and multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease 

information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments in our 2005 financial report that information is incorporated by reference 

our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development in addition the consolidation that has occurred in our industry has created companies with substantial research and development resources we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product obsolescence 

international operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations  human health consumer healthcare and animal health 

revenues from operations outside the us of 246 billion accounted for 48 of our total revenues in 2005 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of 12 countries outside the us in 2005 the us was the only country to contribute more than 10 of our total revenues comprising 52 of revenues in 2005 56 of revenues in 2004 and 60 of revenues in 2003 japan is our secondlargest national market with 7 of our revenues in 2005 and 6 in each of 2004 and 2003

our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of products 

see government regulation and price constraints below for discussion of these matters 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2005 revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar increased our reported revenues in many countries while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments see the discussion under note 9d to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2005 financial report that discussion is incorporated by reference related information about valuation and risks associated with such financial instruments in parts e and f of that same note is also incorporated by reference 

marketing 

in our global human health business we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer print and television advertising that communicates the approved uses benefits and risks of our products while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness important public health issues and our patient assistance programs in all major markets 

our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations our structure aligns the sales marketing and medical functions to work closely in tandem along the same therapeutic groups of products reinforcing common coordination focus and accountability across the organizations 

our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies we seek to gain access to health authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended approved andor reimbursed medicines and other products by demonstrating the clinical and economic value of our products we also work with mcos and pbms and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines in 2005 for instance we were awarded a center for medicaremedicaid studies “cms” contract to provide the green ribbon health initiative a jointpartnership with the mco humana designed to improve the health and quality of life for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions in central florida

in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period are those for the drugs set forth in the table below the table also includes patent expiration information relating to certain recently approved drugs 

 in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions however in some cases such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent

companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor norvasc  celebrex and detrol 

we also have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues 

the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short period in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to otc products 

one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products under international agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights is improving the general agreement on tariffs and trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a tenyear transition period a number of countries are doing this we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement 

competition 

our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets many of our human pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded drugs or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications the principal forms of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses 

our human health business is the largest in the world our competitors include other worldwide researchbased drug companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases or indications as our major products 

such competition affects our core product innovation business focused on discovering and marketing products that satisfy unmet medical needs and providing therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multibilliondollar investment in research and development over the past decade resulting in one of the strongest product pipelines in the industry we also continue to enhance the organizational effectiveness of our pharmaceutical sales and marketing functions coordinating support for our salespeople’s efforts to launch and promote our products to our customers 

operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition industry regulation and cost containment we are taking important measures to address this business environment we continue to evaluate adapt and improve our business practices to better meet customer and public needs for instance we have taken an industryleading role in evolving our approaches to directtoconsumer advertising and medical education grants we have also restructured our us sales organization to streamline customer interactions with our field force ensuring that each doctor will interface with no more than two sales representatives per therapeutic area finally we continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through campaigns for better healthcare solutions 

our consumer healthcare business is one of the largest in the world however many other companies large and small manufacture and sell one or more products that are similar to our consumer healthcare products including major retail customers that sell “private label” or “house” brands sources of competitive advantage include product quality and efficacy including differentiated claims brand identity advertising and promotion product innovation broad distribution capabilities and price significant expenditures for advertising promotion and marketing are generally required to achieve and maintain both consumer and trade acceptance of consumer healthcare products 

while our animal health business is one of the largest in the world many other companies offer competitive products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include product innovation quality price service and effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately 180 million people in the us now participate in some version of managed care because of the size of 

the patient population covered by mcos marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations has become important to our business 

mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has been increasing in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices a major objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers they use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases 

as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies 

exclusion of a product from a formulary or other restrictions such as requiring prior authorizations can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on most mco formularies 

the impact of mcos on drug prices and volumes may increase as the result of their role in negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the new medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit medicare part d effective january 1 2006 mcos and pbms negotiate on behalf of the federal government as prescription drug plans or pdps we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products that are used by the senior population included on the formularies of the new medicare pdps 

another way we demonstrate the value of pharmaceuticals in the context of an appropriate approach to the management of healthcare is by developing disease management programs these programs can improve patient care by improving patient communications and compliance with dosage directions they can also help show that a comprehensive approach to healthcare management which includes prevention diagnosis and treatment of certain conditions and appropriate use of pharmaceuticals can improve the quality of care and lower costly complications of chronic diseases as noted above in marketing  in 2005 we were awarded a cms contract to provide the green ribbon health initiative a jointpartnership with the mco humana designed to improve the health and quality of life for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions in central florida additionally we sponsor a program offered by the state of florida agency for health care administration to help manage chronic diseases among florida’s medicaid population 

generic products 

one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face in the us which is also growing internationally is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of 

patent protection for a product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiry generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about the product to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic products however need only demonstrate a level of availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the innovator product this means that generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and charge much less 

in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor will begin to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in the us pfizer’s greenstone subsidiary sells generic versions of pfizer’s pharmaceutical products upon loss of exclusivity as appropriate 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2005 and none are expected in 2006 

government regulation and price constraints 

in the united states 

general pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance is the fda in the us it has jurisdiction over our human pharmaceutical business and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda also regulates most of our consumer healthcare products and along with the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency our animal health products 

in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services the federal trade commission and the department of justice individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 

we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various regulatory bodies see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2005 financial report such actions may include product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions 

the fda is considering changes to its approach to “followon biological” products which are the biological product equivalent to generic pharmaceutical products changes that would facilitate the approval of such products could have an adverse impact on the company’s business 

medicare  in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 medicare act was enacted medicare beneficiaries are now eligible to obtain subsidized prescription drug coverage from a private sector provider it remains difficult to predict the impact of the 2003 

medicare act on pharmaceutical companies usage of pharmaceuticals may increase as the result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by the partial reimbursement under medicare such potential sales increases however may be offset by increased pricing pressures due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector providers that negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries effective january 1 2007 reimbursement under medicare for ed medicines including viagra  will end 

pfizer is committed to helping those without coverage gain access to pfizer products to that end in 2004 we implemented our helpful answers program an umbrella program that includes existing pfizer patient assistance programs as well as pfizer pfriends a new prescription discount card offering savings on pfizer prescription medicines to all uninsured americans regardless of age or income in january 2005 we also joined together rx access with nine other pharmaceutical companies to offer savings on over 275 medicines to medicareineligible uninsured individuals under 65 who fall below certain income thresholds pfizer also participates in another industry program the partnership for prescription assistance a single point of access to more than 475 public and private patient assistance programs 

importation of drugs  there is considerable political pressure to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs that are marketed outside the us and sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to raising safety concerns such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us while the 2003 medicare act maintains the current prohibition on such imports it would allow importation from canada if the secretary of health and human services certifies that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers before the 2003 medicare act federal law would have permitted importation of medicines into the us from a considerably larger group of developed countries provided the secretary of health and human services made the same safety and costsavings certifications on december 21 2004 the department of health and human services hhs and the department of commerce issued their reports on drug importation and foreign price controls the hhs report noted that it would be “extraordinarily difficult to ensure that drugs personally imported by individual consumers” could meet the standards of safety that would support certifying as safe such importation while the report also concluded that the us could establish a feasible basis for commercial drug importation such a change in the law would require “new legal authorities substantial additional resources and significant restrictions on the types of drugs that could be imported” the report also noted that the total savings to be expected from such a commercial importation regime would be relatively small — 1 or 2 of total drug spending in the us the commerce department report confirmed that the lower prices in many countries result from governmental price controls and these price controls adversely affect the amount of funding that is available for the discovery of new drugs 

medicaid and related matters  federal law requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program in recent years various proposals have been offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the medicaid program a national commission is currently studying changes to the medicaid program in the short term driven by budget concerns many states have implemented restrictive drug lists and state supplemental rebate programs under the medicaid program these programs require deeper rebate payments by pfizer in order to have our products listed on formularies in states with such rebate programs more than 35 states have implemented some form of formulary restrictions in their medicaid programs currently pfizer enjoys relatively good formulary access in state medicaid programs 

effective january 1 2006 federal funds may not be used for reimbursement of erectile dysfunction medications by the medicaid program in addition effective january 1 2007 changes to treatment of authorized generics for purposes of calculating medicaid rebates will increase the amount of rebates we are required to pay on brand name drug sales after loss of exclusivity and on authorized generic sales to the medicaid program 

if changes are implemented under the medicaid program that further restrict the access of a significant number of patients to our products 

and require significantly deeper rebate payments our business could be adversely affected the impact of any such changes on pfizer would be mitigated by the shrinking size of the medicaid market those people who are eligible for both medicaid and medicare often called “dual eligibles” had been receiving their drug benefits under the medicaid program beginning in 2006 their coverage is being transferred to the new medicare part d program this will reduce the number of enrollees in medicaid drug programs by about 14 but reduce the amount of spending on pharmaceuticals under medicaid by approximately 57 while the medicaid market is now smaller changes at the state level could impact larger federal and commercial accounts 

in addition some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible as well as various approaches to controlling pharmaceutical marketing a sweeping price control ballot proposal was defeated in california during 2005 

we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the revenues section of our 2005 financial report and in note 1g to our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies revenues in our 2005 financial report which discussions are incorporated by reference 

outside the united states 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices 

the approval of new drugs across the eu may only be achieved using the mutual recognition proceduredecentralized procedure or eu commissionemea’s central approval process which applies in the 25 eu member states ten new member states joined the eu in may 2004 which has extended the scope of these procedures plus norway and iceland which are full participants in these registration processes the use of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval across the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country 

since the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states we continue to deal with individual countries on such matters across the region 

during 2004 a comprehensive package of reforms was adopted called new medicines legislation amending eu law on the regulation of medicinal products in many areas including approval procedures and safety reporting of particular note the data exclusivity periods during which innovative companies’ regulatory data are protected are required to be harmonized in all member states and implementation is underway in most member states which will facilitate the approval and launch of generic medicines in addition these reforms introduced a clear legal basis for the approval of “biosimilar” or “followon biological” products in the eu following a positive scientific assessment announced in january 2006 we expect that the first such product a biosimilar version of genotropin will be approved in the eu this year this new set of regulations which took effect in november 2005 also shortens certain approval timelines and introduces fasttrack and conditional centralized authorizations 

environmental law compliance 

most of our operations are affected by federal state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2005 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2005 for environmental 

compliance purposes and for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows 

environmentrelated capital expenditures — 87 million other environmentrelated expenses — 287 million while we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 

tax matters 

the discussion of taxrelated matters in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements taxes on income  in our 2005 financial report is incorporated by reference 

employees 

in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 106000 people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a risk factors and cautionary factors that may affect future results 

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2005 form 10k and in our 2005 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” “target” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance in particular these include statements relating to future actions prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

government regulation and managed care trends 

us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations in the us many of 

our pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures may increase as the result of the 2003 medicare act in addition mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts government efforts to reduce medicaid expenses may continue to increase the use of mcos this may result in managed care’s influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices for our products in addition some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patientaccess constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible other matters also could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could adversely affect our business including the importation of prescription drugs that are marketed outside the us and sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries 

the prohibition on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of ed medications by the medicaid program which became effective january 1 2006 and the similar federal funding prohibition for the medicare program which is scheduled to take effect january 1 2007 may adversely affect our business any prohibitions on the use of federal funds for reimbursement of other classes of drugs in the future may also have an adverse effect 

we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue 

generic competition 

competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for us in the us and is growing internationally upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period which can adversely affect our business the us basic patent for zithromax expired in 2005 and the us basic patent for zoloft will expire in 2006 and for each of norvasc and zyrtec will expire in 2007 also the patents covering several of our most important medicines including lipitor  norvasc  celebrex and detrol  are being challenged by generic manufacturers in addition our patentprotected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of branded products of competitors that lose their market exclusivity for example lipitor will begin to face competition from generic pravastatin pravachol and generic simvastatin zocor during 2006 

changes by the fda to its approach to “followon biologics” could subject genotropin to generic competition 

competitive products 

we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with our drugs including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time launches of a number of competitive products have occurred recently and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries 

dependence on key inline and new products 

we recorded product sales of more than 1 billion for each of eight pharmaceutical products in 2005 lipitor norvasc zoloft celebrex zithromaxzmax viagra zyrtec  and xalatan  xalacom those products accounted for 55 of our total 2005 revenues lipitor sales in 

2005 exceeded 12 billion accounting for 24 of our total 2005 revenues if these or any of our other major products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection changes in prescription growth rates material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from existing competitive products or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant as noted patents covering several of our bestselling medicines recently have expired or will expire this year or next year and patents covering a number of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges in addition our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products including lyrica exubera sutent and the product candidate champix  

uncertainty relating to cox2 medicines 

our goal is to make celebrex available to increased numbers of patients however our ability to increase celebrex sales may be limited significantly by the uncertainty concerning cox2 medicines related to the regulatory actions involving those medicines that were taken last year 

research and development investment 

the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products is very important to the success of the company however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

development regulatory approval and marketing of products 

risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products there also are many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements 

research studies 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results 

interest rate and foreign exchange risk 

48 of our 2005 revenues were derived from international operations including 18 from countries in the euro zone and 7 from japan these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management in our 2005 financial report for additional details see note 9d to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2005 

financial report those sections of our 2005 financial report are incorporated by reference 

notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses 

risks affecting international operations 

our international operations also could be affected by changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of products as well as by unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes any of these changes could adversely affect our business 

product manufacturing and marketing risks 

difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future results 

cost and expense controlunusual events 

growth in costs and expenses changes in product segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular the impact of the possible sale or spinoff of our consumer healthcare business and our ability to realize the projected benefits of our adapting to scale multiyear productivity initiative 

changes in laws and accounting standards 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 

terrorist activity 

our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of future terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

legal proceedings 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities environmental and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations

business segments we operate in three business segments human health previously named “pharmaceutical” consumer healthcare and animal health we also operate several other businesses including the manufacture of empty softgelatin capsules contract manufacturing and bulk pharmaceutical chemicals due to the size of these businesses they are grouped in and their results and assets are included in the “corporateother” category of our segment information comparative segment revenues and related financial information for 2004 2003 and 2002 are presented in the table captioned segment in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and revenue information in our 2004 financial report and the section headed revenues in our 2004 financial report the information from those sections of our 2004 financial report is incorporated by reference in this 2004 form 10k our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries where we operate in the us the principal authority regulating our operations is the food and drug administration fda the fda regulates the safety and efficacy of the products we offer and our research quality manufacturing processes product promotion advertising and product labeling similar regulations exist in most other countries and in many countries the government also regulates our prices see government regulation and price constraints below 

human health segment our human health business is the largest pharmaceutical business in the world this segment includes treatments for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases central nervous system disorders arthritis and pain infectious and respiratory diseases urogenital conditions cancer eye disease endocrine disorders and allergies in 2004 human health revenues increased 17 to 461 billion due to strong performances across a broad range of products the inclusion of a full year of pharmacia product sales and the favorable impact of foreign exchange revenues from this segment contributed 88 of our total revenues in each of 2004 2003 and 2002 we recorded product sales of more than 1 billion for each of ten pharmaceutical products in 2004 those ten products  lipitor norvasc zoloft celebrex neurontin zithromax viagra zyrtec bextra and xalatan  represented 69 of human health revenues in 2004 a table captioned revenues  major human health products in our 2004 financial report is incorporated by reference our principal pharmaceutical products and certain recently approved products are as follows cardiovascular and metabolic diseases  2 

 central nervous system disorders  3 

 arthritis and pain  infectious and respiratory diseases  urogenital conditions  4 

 cancer  eye disease  endocrine disorders  allergies  

consumer healthcare segment our consumer healthcare business is one of the largest in the world we market many of the world’s bestknown otc medications for oral care upper respiratory health tobacco dependence gastrointestinal health skin care eye care and hair growth in 2004 consumer healthcare revenues increased 19 to 35 billion due to the strong performance of listerine mouthwash which benefited from the us launch of natural citrus flavor listerine in september 2003 and the launch of listerine advanced in september 2004 the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the inclusion of pharmacia product revenues for a full year revenues from this segment contributed 7 of our total revenues in both 2004 and 2003 and 8 in 2002 consumer healthcare’s principal products include       5 

             consumer healthcare can extend the life of some of our prescription medications by converting them to otc medications for example nicorette benadryl sudafed and zantac 75 were all previously prescription products and zantac 150 was launched as an otc medicine in january 2005 as market conditions permit and when we have necessary approval from drug regulatory authorities we plan to pursue similar launches for other products 

animal health segment our animal health business is the largest in the world we discover develop and sell products for the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock and companion animals in 2004 animal health revenues increased 22 to 20 billion due to strong performances by key inline brands significant product launches including draxxin and excede for respiratory disease in cattle and swine strong growth in sales of rimadyl revolution and clavamox for companion animals the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the inclusion of pharmacia product revenues for a full year revenues from this segment contributed 37 of our total revenues in 2004 36 of total revenues in 2003 and 35 of total revenues in 2002 among the products we market are parasiticides antiinflammatories vaccines antibiotics and related medicines including the products discussed below parasiticides constitute the largest segment of the animal health market for companion animals consisting mainly of medicines for the control of parasites such as fleas and heartworm our product revolution  is our largestselling parasiticide for companion animals   rimadyl relieves pain and inflammation associated with canine osteoarthritis and soft tissue orthopedic surgery rimadyl is the only arthritis pain medication prescribed by veterinarians available in chewable tablets regular caplets and in an injectable formulation   clavamoxsynulox is an antibiotic for skin and soft tissue infections in dogs and cats our vaccine portfolio for livestock is extensive and includes respisureone stellamuneone a singledose vaccine used to prevent pneumonia in swine and bovishield gold a cattle vaccine for reproductive and respiratory protection   dectomax injectable and pouron formulations remove and control internal and external parasites in beef cattle   naxcelexcenel rtu is an antibiotic used to treat respiratory and internal infections in cattle and swine 

research and product development innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs this goal has been supported by our substantial research and development investments we spent 77 billion in 2004 75 billion in 2003 and 52 billion in 2002 on research and development we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through acquisition licensing or other arrangements drug discovery and development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers 6 

proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from early discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research we believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number of pharmaceutical compounds we have in all stages of development we currently are working on approximately 225 projects in development including approximately 145 new molecular entities and 80 productline extensions in addition we have more than 400 projects in discovery research in recent years our discovery scientists have delivered dozens of new chemical compounds to early development while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering development are the foundation for future products in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them in 2004 for example the fda approved the additional use of geodon for the treatment of acute mania in bipolar disorder information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments in our 2004 financial report that information is incorporated by reference our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development in addition the consolidation that has occurred in our industry has created companies with substantial research and development resources we also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product obsolescence 

international operations we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations — human health consumer healthcare and animal health revenues from operations outside the us of 23 billion accounted for 44 of our total revenues in 2004 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of ten countries outside the us in 2004 the us was the only country to contribute more than 10 of our total revenues comprising 56 of revenues in 2004 60 of our revenues in 2003 and 64 of our revenues in 2002 japan is our secondlargest national market with 6 of our revenues in each of 2004 2003 and 2002 for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues see the table captioned geographic in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and revenue information in our 2004 financial report and the table captioned change in geographic revenues in our 2004 financial report those tables are incorporated by reference our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include currency fluctuations capital and exchange control regulations expropriation and other restrictive government actions our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of products see government regulation and price constraints below for discussion of these matters depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2004 revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar increased our reported revenues in many countries while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments see the discussion under note 8d to our consolidated 7 

financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in our 2004 financial report that discussion is incorporated by reference related information about valuation and risks associated with such financial instruments in parts e and f of that same note is also incorporated by reference 

marketing in our global human health business we promote our products to health care providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos and government agencies through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses and advantages of our products to healthcare providers we also market directly to consumers in the us through directtoconsumer print and television advertising in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public about our innovative medical research our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations each sales organization markets a distinct group of products our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies we seek to gain access to health authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products and reimbursement lists by demonstrating the qualities and treatment benefits of our products we also work with mcos and pbms and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines for example we sponsor a program offered by the state of florida agency for health care administration that is designed to help manage chronic diseases among florida’s medicaid population our consumer healthcare business primarily uses its own representatives to directly promote its products including marketing certain products directly to professionals using a professional detail force we also use print and television consumer advertising and offer sales incentives such as coupons our consumer products are sold through various retailers our animal health business also uses its own sales organization to promote its products its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to health professionals directly and through veterinary journals animal health and nutrition products are sold through veterinarians drug wholesalers distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users where appropriate these products are also marketed through print and television advertising during 2004 sales to our three largest customers were as follows  sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the human health segment apart from these instances none of our business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers 

patents and intellectual property rights our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its 8 

coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period are those for the following drugs  

in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of further diseases or conditions however such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic drug competition after the expiration of the basic product patent   zithromax is patented by pliva a croatian pharmaceutical company the drug is licensed exclusively to us by pliva for sales and marketing in major countries and we purchase the compound in bulk crude form from pliva although zithromax has experienced patent expirations in certain countries it retains basic patent protection in the us until november 2005   zyrtec is patented by the belgian company ucb sa and is licensed to us for sales in the us canada europe australia and south africa we copromote zyrtec as a prescription medicine in the us with a subsidiary of ucb sa and have a license to sell zyrtec under various trade names as an otc medicine in the other markets   aricept is patented by eisai co ltd we copromote aricept with eisai in the us and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug in certain other countries   xalatan is not protected by a basic product patent however we have broadly patented ophthalmic formulations containing lantanoprost until 2011   genotropin is patented by novo nordisk which has granted us a nonexclusive license to sell the drug in the us the us basic product patent relating to neurontin expired in 1994 however in april 2000 a us patent was granted relating to stable pharmaceutical compositions of neurontin containing low levels of lactam impurity this patent expires in 2017 however neurontin now faces competition from generic versions of the product launched “atrisk” before the final resolution of legal proceedings challenging the generic versions by generic drug manufacturers during the latter half of 2004 the patent infringement litigations related to this product continue following the launches of these generic versions in october we launched our own generic version of the product through our greenstone ltd subsidiary other companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we also believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor norvasc  celebrex xalatan and detrol we also have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short period in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special 9 

formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to otc products one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection of our products under international agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights is improving the general agreement on tariffs and trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a tenyear transition period a number of countries are doing this we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement 

competition competition is intense in all of our businesses and includes many large and small competitors the principal means of competition vary among product categories and business groups however the efficacy safety patients’ and customers’ ease of use and cost effectiveness of our products are important factors for success in all of our principal businesses our human pharmaceutical business is the largest in the world we compete with other worldwide researchbased drug companies many smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers other companies manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases or indications as our major products we focus on unmet medical needs and therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation has led to our multibilliondollar research and development investments over the past decade in recent years a comparison of the total cost of medical treatments using pharmaceuticals versus alternative treatments for the same condition has become an important basis of competition mcos and pbms look to cost advantages as well as medical benefits in making their drug formulary decisions our pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization is a valuable competitive asset our salespeople’s ability to reach medical professionals with information about our products helps us respond to competitive efforts and launch new products our consumer healthcare business is one of the largest in the world however many other companies large and small manufacture and sell one or more products that are similar to our consumer healthcare products including major retail customers that sell “private label” or “house” brands sources of competitive advantage include product quality and efficacy including differentiated claims brand identity advertising and promotion product innovation broad distribution capabilities and price significant expenditures for advertising promotion and marketing are generally required to achieve and maintain both consumer and trade acceptance of consumer products while our animal health business is the largest in the world many other companies offer competitive products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include product innovation quality service effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers and price managed care organizations the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the health care marketplace a substantial portion of the us population now participates in some version of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbm’s that serve many of those organizations has become important to our business mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators health maintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has been increasing in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us 10 

the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices a major objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce health care expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers they use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies the impact of mcos on drug prices and volumes may increase as the result of their role in negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the limited outpatient drug benefit under medicare as discussed below under government regulation and price constraints  another way we address the interests of mcos is by developing diseasemanagement programs these programs can be attractive to mcos by improving patient communications and compliance with dosage directions which are important for effective disease treatment they can help mcos address various aspects of disease management such as prevention diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases including use of pharmaceutical products this comprehensive approach can improve the quality of care and lower costly complications of chronic diseases as noted above in marketing  one such program which is sponsored by us and offered by the state of florida agency for health care administration is designed to help manage chronic diseases among florida’s medicaid population generic products one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face in the us and that is growing internationally is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about the product to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the pioneer product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the pioneer product this means that after we have borne the expenses of discovering developing and testing a medicine for safety and efficacy obtaining regulatory approval and informing the medical community about its therapeutic benefits generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and charge much less as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their health care programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require 11 

pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brandname drugs the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it as and when appropriate we will employ our greenstone ltd subsidiary to launch our own generic versions of products after we lose market exclusivity 

raw materials raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2004 and none are expected in 2005 

government regulation and price constraints in the united states   general pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance is the fda in the us it has jurisdiction over our human pharmaceutical business and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda also regulates most of our consumer healthcare products and along with the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency our animal health products in addition many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services the federal trade commission and the department of justice individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various regulatory bodies see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2004 financial report such actions may include product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions   medicare in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 medicare act was enacted under this legislation medicare beneficiaries are eligible to obtain a medicareendorsed drugdiscount card from an mco pbm or other private sector provider through the end of 2005 beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to obtain subsidized prescription drug coverage from a private sector provider it remains difficult to predict the impact of the 2003 medicare act on pharmaceutical companies usage of pharmaceuticals may increase as the result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by the partial reimbursement under medicare such potential sales increases however may be offset by increased pricing pressures due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector providers that will negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries pfizer is committed to helping those without coverage access pfizer products to that end in 2004 we implemented our helpful answers program an umbrella program that includes existing pfizer patient assistance programs as well as pfizer pfriends a new prescription discount card offering savings on pfizer prescription medicines to all uninsured americans regardless of age or income in addition through many medicareapproved drug discount cards including the ushare card on which pfizer partners with united healthcare qualified lowincome medicare beneficiaries have access to up to a thirty day supply of many pfizer medicines for a flat fee of 15 per prescription after they have exhausted the government’s 600 annual credit to date approximately 18 cards offer such a discount in january 2005 we also joined together rx access with nine other pharmaceutical companies to offer savings on over 275 medicines to medicareineligible uninsured individuals under 65 who fall below certain income thresholds   importation of drugs  there is considerable political pressure to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs that are marketed outside the us and sold at prices that are 12 

regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to raising safety concerns such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us while the 2003 medicare act maintains the current prohibition on such imports it would allow importation from canada if the secretary of health and human services certifies that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers before the 2003 medicare act federal law would have permitted importation of medicines into the us from a considerably larger group of developed countries provided the secretary of health and human services made the same safety and costsavings certifications on december 21 2004 the department of health and human services hhs and the department of commerce issued their reports on drug importation and foreign price controls the hhs report noted that it would be “extraordinarily difficult to ensure that drugs personally imported by individual consumers” could meet the standards of safety that would support certifying as safe such importation while the report also concluded that the us could establish a feasible basis for commercial drug importation such a change in the law would require “new legal authorities substantial additional resources and significant restrictions on the types of drugs that could be imported” the report also noted that the total savings to be expected from such a commercial importation regime would be relatively small—1 or 2 of total drug spending in the us the commerce department report confirmed that the lower prices in many countries result from governmental price controls and these price controls adversely affect the amount of funding that is available for the discovery of new drugs   medicaid and related matters  in recent years various proposals have been offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the medicaid program driven by budget concerns some states have implemented and other states are considering importation programs price controls or patientaccess constraints on medicines under the medicaid program if changes are implemented under the medicaid program that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to our innovative medicines our business could be materially affected in addition some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible as well as various approaches to controlling pharmaceutical marketing us law requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program some states and multistate pools are seeking rebates in excess of the amounts required by federal law and there are federal legislative proposals to expand current medicaid rebates we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates in the revenues section of our 2004 financial report and in note 1g to our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies revenues in our 2004 financial report which discussions are incorporated by reference outside the united states we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices since 1998 the approval of new drugs across the eu is possible only using the mutual recognition procedure or emea’s central approval process the use of either of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval within the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each member state further norway and iceland are full participants in these approval processes the addition of ten new member states to the eu in may 2004 has extended the scope of these approval procedures since the eu does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states we will continue to deal with 13 

individual countries on such issues across the enlarged eu during 2004 a comprehensive package of reforms was adopted amending eu law on the regulation of medicinal products in many areas including approval procedures and safety reporting of particular note the data exclusivity periods during which innovative companies’ regulatory data are protected will be harmonized in all member states and the approval and launch of generic medicines will be facilitated in several respects the new law due to take effect by november 2005 will also shorten certain approval timelines and introduce fasttrack and conditional centralized authorizations 

environmental law compliance most of our operations are affected by federal state andor local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings and contingencies in our 2004 financial report as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2004 for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity and for other environmental compliance purposes as follows  while we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

cautionary factors that may affect future results   cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995   our disclosure and analysis in this 2004 form 10k and in our 2004 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance in particular these include statements relating to future actions prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results   we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements   we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you 14 

are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties • us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and patientaccess constraints impact our business and our future results could be affected by changes in such regulations in the us many pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures may increase as the result of the 2003 medicare act on the other hand usage of pharmaceuticals also may increase due to the expanded access to medicines afforded by the partial reimbursement under the 2003 medicare act in addition mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts government efforts to reduce medicaid expenses may continue to increase the use of mcos this may result in managed care’s influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population in addition some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patientaccess constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid eligible other matters that could be the subject of us federal or state legislative or regulatory action affecting our business include the importation of prescription drugs that are marketed outside the us and sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries and the involuntary approval of prescription medicines for otc use we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue • competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge in the us and is growing internationally upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product or upon the “atrisk” launch while patent infringement litigation against the generic product is pending by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of a product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period the patents covering several of our most important medicines including lipitor  norvasc  neurontin celebrex  xalatan and detrol  are being challenged by generic manufacturers • we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with our drugs including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time launches of a number of competitive products have occurred recently and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries • we recorded product sales of more than 1 billion for each of ten pharmaceutical products in 2004 lipitor norvasc zoloft celebrex neurontin zithromax viagra zyrtec bextra and xalatan those products accounted for 61 of our total 2004 revenues if these or any of our other major products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from existing competitive products or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the impact on our revenues could be significant as noted patents 15 

covering several of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges • final actions relating to celebrex andor bextra that may be taken by the fda andor the emea in connection with their respective reviews of the benefits and risks of cox2specific inhibitor medicines and related agents could result in a significant loss of sales of one or both of those drugs which would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations • the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products is very important to the success of the company however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues • risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters could affect the commercial potential of our products there also are many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements • decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results • 44 of our 2004 revenues were derived from international operations including 6 from japan these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management in our 2004 financial report for additional details see note 8d to our consolidated financial statements financial instruments derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  in our 2004 financial report those sections of our 2004 financial report are incorporated by reference notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses • our international operations also could be affected by changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of products as well as by unstable governments and legal systems and intergovernmental disputes • difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future results • growth in costs and expenses changes in product mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could affect future results such risks and uncertainties 16 

include in particular our ability to integrate and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from our acquisition of pharmacia • our future results could be affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries • our future results could be affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of future terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas • we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial securities environmental and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we do not believe any of them will have a material adverse effect on our financial position litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations

research and product development innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs this goal has been supported by our substantial research and development investments we spent 71 billion in 2003 52 billion in 2002 and 48 billion in 2001 on research and development we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through acquisition or through licensing or other arrangements drug discovery and development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from early discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research we believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number of pharmaceutical compounds we have in all stages of development we currently are working on approximately 225 projects in development including approximately 130 new molecular entities and 95 productline extensions in addition we have more than 400 projects in discovery research in recent years our discovery scientists have delivered dozens of new chemical compounds to early development while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering development are the foundation for future products in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them in 2003 for example the fda approved the additional use of zoloft for the treatment of social anxiety disorder information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments on pages 10 through 12 of our 2003 financial report that information is incorporated by reference our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development in addition the consolidation that has occurred in our industry has created companies with substantial 6 research and development resources the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product obsolescence

patents and intellectual property rights our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses pharmaceutical formulations product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the us and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the us basic product patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period are those for the following drugs  in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of further diseases or conditions such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic drug competition after the expiration of the basic product patent 8 while the us basic product patent relating to accupril expired in 2003 we have patents on particular formulations containing quinapril until 2007 the us basic product patent relating to diflucan expired in january 2004 the fda has granted us pediatric exclusivity with respect to diflucan  which extends our marketing exclusivity for six months after the patent expiration date through july 29 2004 the fda’s grant of pediatric exclusivity is the subject of a pending legal challenge see item 3 legal proceedings  below   zithromax is patented by pliva a croatian pharmaceutical company the drug is licensed exclusively to us by pliva for sales and marketing in major countries and we purchase the compound in bulk crude form from pliva   zyrtec is patented by the belgian company ucb sa and is licensed to us for sales in the us canada europe australia and south africa we copromote zyrtec as a prescription medicine in the us with a subsidiary of ucb sa and have a license to sell zyrtec under various trade names as an otc medicine in the other markets   aricept is patented by eisai co ltd we copromote aricept with eisai in the us and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug in certain other countries   xalatan is not protected by a basic product patent however we have broadly patented ophthalmic formulations containing lantanoprost until 2011   genotropin is patented by novo nordisk which has granted us a nonexclusive license to sell the drug in the us the us basic product patent relating to neurontin expired in 1994 however in april 2000 a us patent was granted relating to stable pharmaceutical compositions of neurontin containing low levels of lactam impurity this patent expires in 2017 see item 3 legal proceedings  below regarding the approval by the fda of products that we believe infringe this patent other companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor norvasc  celebrex xalatan and detrol  separately we are defendants in an action alleging patent infringement with respect to our sales of celebrex and bextra  see item 3 legal proceedings  below we have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues the expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the covered product and can result in a significant reduction in sales of the pioneer product in a very short period in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets patents on uses for products patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms and conversion of the active ingredient to otc products one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection of our products under international agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights is improving the general agreement on tariffs and trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a tenyear transition period a number of countries are doing this we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement 

competition competition is intense in all of our businesses and includes many large and small competitors the principal means of competition vary among product categories and business groups however efficacy safety patients’ and customers’ ease of use and cost effectiveness are important factors for success in all of our principal businesses our human pharmaceutical business is the largest in the world we compete with other worldwide researchbased drug companies many smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers 9 we focus on unmet medical needs and therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation has led to our multibilliondollar research and development investments over the past decade in recent years a comparison of the total cost of medical treatments using pharmaceuticals versus alternative treatments for the same condition has become an important basis of competition mcos and pbms look to cost advantages as well as medical benefits in making their drug formulary decisions our pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization is a valuable competitive asset our salespeople’s ability to reach medical professionals with information about our products helps us respond to competitive efforts and launch new products our consumer healthcare business is one of the largest in the world however many other companies large and small manufacture and sell one or more products that are similar to our consumer healthcare products sources of competitive advantage include product quality and efficacy brand identity advertising and promotion product innovation broad distribution capabilities and price significant expenditures for advertising promotion and marketing are generally required to achieve and maintain both consumer and trade acceptance of consumer products while our animal health business is the largest in the world many other companies offer competitive products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include product innovation quality service effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers and price we promote our products directly through our sales representatives as well as through advertising managed care organizations the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the health care marketplace a substantial portion of the us population now participates in some version of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations has become important to our business mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has been increasing in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us the growth of mcos has increased pressure on drug prices a major objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce health care expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers they use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drugs can become favored firstline treatments for certain diseases as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies 10 compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies the impact of mcos on drug prices and volumes may increase as the result of their role in negotiating on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in connection with the recently enacted limited outpatient drug benefit under medicare as discussed below under government regulation and price constraints  another way we address the interests of mcos is by developing diseasemanagement programs these programs can be attractive to mcos by improving patient communications and compliance with dosage directions which are important for effective disease treatment they can help mcos address various aspects of disease management such as prevention diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases including use of pharmaceutical products this comprehensive approach can improve the quality of care and lower costly complications of chronic diseases as noted above in marketing  one such program which is sponsored by us and offered by the state of florida agency for health care administration is designed to help manage chronic diseases among florida’s medicaid population generic products one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face in the us and that is growing internationally is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about the product to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the pioneer product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the pioneer product this means that after we have borne the expenses of discovering developing and testing a medicine for safety and efficacy obtaining regulatory approval and informing the medical community about its therapeutic benefits generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and charge much less as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their health care programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to a brandname drug the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it 

raw materials raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2003 and none are expected in 2004 

government regulation and price constraints in the united states   general  pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business of particular importance is the fda in the us it has jurisdiction over our human pharmaceutical business and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda also regulates most of our consumer healthcare products and along with the us department of agriculture and 11 the us environmental protection agency our animal health products in addition we are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services the federal trade commission and the department of justice individual states acting through their attorneys general have become active as well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws we are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various regulatory bodies see item 3 legal proceedings  below such actions may include product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions   medicare  in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 medicare act was enacted under this legislation medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to obtain a medicareendorsed drugdiscount card from an mco pbm or other private sector provider beginning in the spring of 2004 and continuing through 2005 then beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to purchase prescription drug coverage with limited benefits from a private sector provider at this early stage it is difficult to predict the impact of the 2003 medicare act on pharmaceutical companies usage of pharmaceuticals may increase as the result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by the partial reimbursement under medicare such potential sales increases however may be offset by increased pricing pressures due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector providers that will negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries in 2002 we implemented the pfizer for living share card program in order to help address the issue of affordable access to health care for those most in need through this program lowincome medicare recipients without prescription drug coverage can purchase 30day prescriptions of any pfizer prescription medicine and of the copromoted product aricept at many retail pharmacies for 15 we remain committed to this or similar programs until medicare beneficiaries are eligible to purchase prescription drug coverage beginning in 2006   importation of drugs  there is considerable political pressure to allow the importation into the us of prescription drugs that are manufactured outside the us and sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries in addition to raising safety concerns such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the us while the 2003 medicare act maintains the current prohibition on such imports it would allow importation from canada if the secretary of health and human services certifies that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers before the 2003 medicare act federal law would have permitted importation of medicines into the us from a considerably larger group of developed countries provided the secretary of health and human services made the same safety and costsavings certifications   medicaid and related matters  in recent years various proposals have been offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the medicaid program driven by budget concerns some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patientaccess constraints on medicines under the medicaid program if changes are implemented under the medicaid program that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to our innovative medicines our business could be materially affected in addition some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to all of their residents regardless of income as well as various approaches to controlling pharmaceutical marketing us law requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program some states are seeking rebates in excess of the amounts required by federal law and there are federal legislative proposals to expand current medicaid rebates we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs see the discussion regarding rebates on page 9 of our 2003 financial report which is incorporated by reference 12   hatchwaxman act  under the 1984 drug price competition and patent term restoration act known as the hatchwaxman act if a generic drug company files an abbreviated new drug application with the fda and a researchbased drug company promptly files a lawsuit alleging that the generic product would infringe one or more of its patents approval of the abbreviated new drug application by the fda automatically is stayed for a period of up to 30 months but not beyond the expiration date of the patents the 2003 medicare act includes an amendment to the hatchwaxman act providing that such 30month stays apply only to patents that are submitted to the fda before the submission of an abbreviated new drug application by a generic company this provision has the effect of preventing multiple stays when additional patents are issued after an abbreviated new drug application has been filed the amendment also requires that agreements between researchbased companies and generic drug companies relating to either a brandname drug or a generic drug be filed with the department of justice and the federal trade commission outside the united states we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices since 1998 the approval of new drugs across the eu is possible only using the european medicines evaluation agency’s emea mutual recognition or central approval processes the use of either of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval within the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each member state further norway and iceland are full participants in the eu central approval processes the addition of ten new member states to the eu in may 2004 will extend the scope of these approval procedures since the emea does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in eu member states we will continue to deal with individual countries on such issues across the enlarged eu 

environmental law compliance most of our manufacturing and certain of our research operations are affected by federal state and local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see item 3 legal proceedings  below as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2003 for the cleanup of certain past industrial activity and for other environmental protection purposes as follows  while we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

cautionary factors that may affect future results   cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995   our disclosure and analysis in this 2003 form 10k and in our 2003 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance in particular these include statements relating to future actions prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results   we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements   we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties • us and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and patientaccess constraints impact our business and our future results could be affected by changes in such regulations in the us many pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures such pressures may increase as the result of the 2003 medicare act on the other hand usage of pharmaceuticals also may increase due to the expanded access to medicines afforded by the partial reimbursement under the 2003 medicare act in addition mcos as well as medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts government efforts to reduce medicaid expenses may continue to increase the use of mcos this may result in managed care’s influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population in addition some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or patientaccess constraints under the medicaid program and some states are considering pricecontrol regimes that would apply to all of their residents regardless of income other matters that could be the subject of us legislative or regulatory action affecting our business include the importation of prescription drugs that are manufactured outside the us and sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries and the involuntary approval of prescription medicines for otc use we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences 14 between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue • competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge in the us and is growing internationally upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period the us basic product patent covering diflucan expired in january 2004 the fda has granted us pediatric exclusivity with respect to diflucan  which extends our marketing exclusivity through july 29 2004 but the grant of pediatric exclusivity is subject to a pending legal challenge by a generic manufacturer the patents covering several of our other medicines including lipitor  norvasc  neurontin celebrex  xalatan and detrol  are being challenged by generic manufacturers • we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible effect on our sales products that compete with our drugs including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time launches of a number of competitive products have occurred recently and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries • we recorded product sales of more than 1 billion for each of nine pharmaceutical products in 2003 lipitor norvasc zoloft neurontin zithromax celebrex viagra zyrtec and diflucan those products accounted for 61 of our 2003 revenues in addition xalatanxalcom achieved more than 1 billion in annual sales in 2003 including 2003 sales prior to our acquisition of pharmacia in april if these or any of our other major products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection material product liability litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from existing competitive products or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the impact on our revenues could be significant as noted patents covering several of our bestselling medicines are the subject of pending legal challenges • the discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional uses for existing products is very important to the success of the company however balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues • risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products there also are many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements • decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results • 406 of our 2003 revenues derived from international operations including 59 from japan these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency 15 exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management on pages 19 and 20 of our 2003 financial report for additional details see note 5d to our consolidated financial statements derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  on pages 35 through 37 of our 2003 financial report those sections of our 2003 financial report are incorporated by reference notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses • our international operations also could be affected by changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of products as well as by unstable governments and legal systems intergovernmental disputes and possible nationalization • difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future results • growth in costs and expenses changes in product mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to integrate and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from our acquisition of pharmacia • our future results could be affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries • our future results could be affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of future terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas • we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial environmental and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we do not believe any of them will have a material adverse effect on our financial position litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have valid defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe that we have valid defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations

discontinued operations we sold or are in the process of selling the following businesses and product lines that do not fit our strategic goals  the divestitures of the adams and schickwilkinson sword businesses and the women’s health product lines are expected to close in the first half of 2003 and are subject to the usual regulatory approvals certain financial information relating to these divested or tobedivested businesses and product lines is set forth in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements discontinued operations  on page 51 of our 2002 annual report that information is incorporated by reference 

research and product development innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs this goal has been supported by our substantial research and development investments we spent 52 billion in 2002 48 billion in 2001 and 44 billion in 2000 on research and development we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out innovative technologies developed by third parties to acquire or incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through licensing or other arrangements drug discovery and development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research we believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number of pharmaceutical compounds and new therapies we have in all stages of development we currently are working on more than 160 projects in development and several hundred projects in discovery research in recent years our discovery scientists have delivered dozens of new chemical compounds to early development while these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval new drug candidates entering development are the foundation for future products in addition to discovering and developing new products our research operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them in february 2003 for example the fda approved the additional use of zoloft for the treatment of social anxiety disorder information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments on pages 33 and 34 of our 2002 annual report that information is incorporated by reference in february 2003 we submitted an application to the european medicines evaluation agency for approval of our developmental compound pregabalin for the treatment of neuropathic pain and for use with other medications in the treatment of epilepsy we expect to submit an application to the fda for the use of pregabalin for those conditions as well as for generalized anxiety disorder later this year our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development in addition the consolidation that has occurred in our 5 industry has created companies with substantial research and development resources the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product obsolescence 

international operations we have significant operations outside the united states they are conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors and involve the same business segments — pharmaceutical and consumer products — as our us operations revenues from operations outside the us of 116 billion accounted for 359 of our total revenues in 2002 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of seven countries outside the us in 2002 no single country outside the us contributed more than 10 of our total revenues japan is our secondlargest national market with 61 of our revenues in 2002 62 in 2001 and 66 in 2000 for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues see the table captioned geographic in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements segment geographic and revenue information on page 65 of our 2002 annual report and the table captioned percentage change in geographic revenues on page 31 of our 2002 annual report those tables are incorporated by reference our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include  • currency fluctuations  • capital and exchange control regulations  • expropriation and nationalization  • other restrictive government actions our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of products see government regulation and price constraints below for discussion of these matters depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or reduce the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2002 foreign exchange had a nominal impact on revenues while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments see the discussion under note 6d to our consolidated financial statements derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  on pages 53 and 54 of our 2002 annual report that discussion is incorporated by reference related information about valuation and risks associated with such financial instruments in parts e and f of that same note is also incorporated by reference 

marketing in our global pharmaceutical business we promote our products to health care providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms managed care organizations mcos and government agencies we also market directly to consumers in the united states through directtoconsumer print and television advertising in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public about our innovative medical research our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations each sales organization markets a distinct group of products our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses and advantages of our products to medical professionals we work to gain access to health authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products and reimbursement lists by demonstrating the qualities and treatment benefits of our products we also work with mcos and pbms to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines for example we sponsor a program offered by the state of florida agency for health care administration that is designed to help manage chronic diseases among florida’s medicaid population 6 marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals depends to a degree on complex decisions about the scope of clinical trials made years before product approval all drugs must complete clinical trials required by regulatory authorities to show they are safe and effective for treating one or more medical problems a manufacturer may choose however to undertake additional studies including comparative clinical trials with competitive products to demonstrate additional advantages of a compound those studies can be costly and take years to complete and the results are uncertain balancing these considerations makes it difficult to decide whether and when to undertake such additional studies but when they are successful such studies can have a major impact on approved marketing claims and strategies separate sales organizations are used by our animal health business to promote its products its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to health professionals directly and through medical journals animal health and nutrition products are sold through veterinarians drug wholesalers distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users where appropriate these products are also marketed through print and television advertising our chc business primarily uses its own representatives to directly promote its products we also use print and television consumer advertising and offer sales incentives such as coupons to promote our consumer products these products are sold through various retailers chc also markets and advertises certain products directly to professionals using a professional detail force during 2002 sales to our three largest pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare products wholesalers were as follows  sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the pharmaceutical segment apart from these instances neither of our business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers 

patents and intellectual property rights our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover  patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the united states and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic us patent expires including where applicable the additional sixmonth pediatric exclusivity period are those for the following drugs  7  in some instances there are laterexpiring patents relating to these products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of further diseases or conditions such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic drug competition after the expiration of the basic patent   zithromax is patented by pliva a croatian pharmaceutical company the drug is licensed exclusively to us by pliva for sales and marketing in major countries and we purchase the compound in bulk crude form from pliva   celebrex is patented by pharmacia corporation with whom we copromote celebrex in all world markets except japan an action against pharmacia and the company alleging patent infringement with respect to the sale of celebrex as well as bextra  was dismissed on march 5 2003 the plaintiff in that action has appealed the decision   zyrtec is patented by the belgian company ucb sa and is licensed to us for sales in the us canada europe australia and south africa we copromote zyrtec as a prescription medicine in the us with a subsidiary of ucb sa and have a license to sell zyrtec as an otc medicine in the other markets   aricept is patented by eisai co ltd we copromote aricept with eisai in the us and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug in various other countries the basic us patents relating to neurontin expired in 1994 and 2000 however in april 2000 a us patent was granted relating to stable pharmaceutical compositions of neurontin containing low levels of lactam impurity this patent expires in 2017 other companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe this patent in addition other companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering among other products lipitor norvasc zoloft  diflucan accupril and procardia xl  in the case of zoloft  while generic manufacturers are challenging certain of our patents the outcome of these challenges will not affect the timing of generic competition with this product due to the existence of additional patents we have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues the expiration of a product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the covered product and particularly in the us can result in a significant reduction in sales of the pioneer product in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from • product manufacturing trade secrets • patents on uses for products • patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients • patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms • conversion of the active ingredient to otc products the effect of product patent expiration or loss also depends upon • the nature of the market and the position of the product in it • the growth of the market • the complexities and economics of manufacture of the product • the requirements of generic drug laws one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection of our products under international agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights is improving the general agreement on tariffs and trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a tenyear transition period a number 8 of countries are doing this we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement see item 3 legal proceedings  below 

competition competition is intense in all of our businesses and includes many large and small competitors the principal means of competition vary among product categories and business groups technological innovations affecting  are important to success in all of our businesses our businesses also focus on unmet medical needs and therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation has led to our multibilliondollar research and development investments over the past decade our human pharmaceutical business competes with other worldwide researchbased drug companies many smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers our pharmaceutical operations are the largest in the world in recent years a comparison of the total cost of medical treatments using pharmaceuticals versus alternative treatments for the same condition has become an important basis of competition mcos and pbms look to cost advantages as well as medical benefits in making their drug formulary decisions our pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization is a valuable competitive asset our salespeople’s ability to reach medical professionals with information about our products helps us respond to competitive efforts and launch new products we have a significant presence in the animal health marketplace but many other companies offer competitive products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include  we promote our products directly through our sales representatives as well as through advertising many other companies large and small manufacture and sell one or more products that are similar to our consumer healthcare products sources of competitive advantage include  significant expenditures for advertising promotion and marketing are generally required to achieve both consumer and trade acceptance of consumer products in the current environment of competitive pressures on profit margins we continue efforts to control the growth of our expenses we have kept our costs down in areas such as manufacturing distribution and sales administration by restructuring and consolidating facilities these measures have brought us new efficiencies and reduced or contained our operating expenses managed care organizations the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the health care marketplace over half the us population now participates in some version of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations has become important to our business mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators health 9 maintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has been increasing in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us a major objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce health care expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers they use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price the growth of mcos also appears to have led to greater usage of some drugs the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for more costly treatments such as hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery because of these advantages such drugs can become favored firstline treatments in addition the current trend of some patients to opt for managed care alternatives to medicare may increase overall pharmaceutical usage among that segment of the elderly population medicare generally does not pay for outpatient use of medicines so patients who do not have another source of prescription drug coverage must bear that cost mcos however often offer drug benefits for their participants these developments not only have created pressure on prices but also have increased sales of products on formularies we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies another way we address the interests of mcos is by developing diseasemanagement programs these programs can be attractive to mcos by improving patient communications and compliance with dosage directions which are important for effective disease treatment they can help mcos address various aspects of disease management such as prevention diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases including use of pharmaceutical products this comprehensive approach can improve the quality of care and lower costly complications of chronic diseases as noted above in marketing  one such program which is sponsored by us and offered by the state of florida agency for health care administration is designed to help manage chronic diseases among florida’s medicaid population generic products one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face in the us and that is growing internationally is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of us patent protection on a product we can lose the major portion of us sales of that product in a very short period generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about the product to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the pioneer product generic products need only demonstrate a level of 10 availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the pioneer product this means that after we have borne the expenses of discovering developing and testing a medicine for safety and efficacy obtaining regulatory approval and informing the medical community about its therapeutic benefits generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration of our patent charge much less and still be profitable as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their health care programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to a brandname drug the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it 

raw materials raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2002 and none are expected in 2003 

government regulation and price constraints pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by numerous national state and local agencies of particular importance is the fda in the united states it has jurisdiction over virtually all of our businesses and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products fda requirements andor reviews have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market the fda also regulates most of our consumer healthcare products and along with the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency our animal health products since 1998 the approval of new drugs across the european union eu is possible only using the european medicines evaluation agency’s emea mutual recognition or central approval processes the use of either of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval within the 15 member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each member state further on january 1 2000 norway and iceland became full participants in the eu central approval processes in addition the agreement between the eu and 12 other european states to base their approvals on the centralized eu approval will significantly speed the regulatory process in those countries the emea does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in eu member countries however we continue to deal with individual countries on such issues in recent years in the us various legislative proposals have been offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the affected health care systems some states have passed such legislation and further federal and state proposals are possible such proposals and legislation include and future proposals could include price controls or patient access constraints on medicines and increases in required rebates or discounts similar issues exist in many foreign countries where we do business we cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives but we will work to maintain patient access to our products and to oppose price constraints in the us federal proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicare program and federal and state proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicaid program driven by budget concerns medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others if the medicare and medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to our innovative medicines our business could be materially affected on the other hand relatively little pharmaceutical use is currently covered by medicare if changes to medicare shift patients to mcos that cover 11 pharmaceuticals or if an outpatient drug benefit is added to medicare usage of pharmaceuticals could increase pricing pressures likely would ensue in either case given the enhancement of the purchasing power of the mcos or the federal government medicare currently does not generally provide outpatient prescription drug coverage in this context in order to help address the issue of affordable access to health care for those most in need we instituted the pfizer for living share card program in 2002 through this program lowincome medicare recipients without prescription drug coverage can purchase 30day prescriptions of any pfizer prescription medicine and of the copromoted product aricept at many retail pharmacies for 15 us law requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program some states are seeking rebates in excess of the amounts required by federal law and there are federal legislative proposals to expand current medicaid rebates we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs in 2000 and 2001 the states of vermont and maine received approval of waivers from the centers for medicare and medicaid services that would expand medicaid rebates beyond the current medicaid population both of these waivers were struck down by federal appeals courts separately in 2000 the state of maine passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to provide the same price discounts to residents of the state regardless of their income who are not eligible for medicaid as are provided to medicaid participants if a pharmaceutical company declines to provide such discounts to the nonmedicaid population in most cases doctors will not be allowed to prescribe that company’s drugs to medicaid patients without obtaining prior authorization from the state the maine program was upheld by a federal appeals court in 2001 that decision has been appealed to the us supreme court and a decision is expected later this year if the maine program is upheld on appeal other states may adopt similar legislation that would extend medicaidlevel discounts beyond the current medicaid population rebates potentially could be viewed as price discounts without appreciable increases in volume as an offset see the discussion regarding rebates on page 32 of our 2002 annual report which discussion is incorporated by reference we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices in october 2002 the bush administration announced a regulatory initiative relating to patent litigation pursuant to the 1984 drug price competition and patent term restoration act known as the hatchwaxman act under the hatchwaxman act if a generic drug company files an abbreviated new drug application anda with the fda and a researchbased drug company promptly files a lawsuit alleging that the generic product would infringe one or more of its patents approval of the anda by the fda automatically is stayed for a period of up to 30 months the proposed regulation would permit only one such 30month stay period to be triggered by a patentinfringement suit between a researchbased firm and an anda applicant the proposed regulation also would clarify the type of patents eligible for listing in the fda’s “orange book” a final fda regulation is anticipated this year it also is possible that legislation amending the hatchwaxman act could be enacted this year one possible amendment would codify the bush administration’s regulatory initiative and also require that settlements in patentchallenge cases between researchbased drug companies and generic drug companies be reported to the federal trade commission other proposals that would be detrimental to the innovative pharmaceutical industry already have been introduced and could be enacted in addition to the fda the us department of agriculture and the us environmental 12 protection agency we are subject to the jurisdiction of various other regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services the federal trade commission and the department of justice in the us we are therefore subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by those regulatory bodies see item 3 legal proceedings  below such actions may include product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases we have initiated product recalls voluntarily it is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting us 

environmental law compliance most of our manufacturing and certain research operations are affected by federal state and local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see item 3 legal proceedings  below as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2002 for environmental protection and cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows  while we cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

banking and insurance subsidiaries we conduct international banking operations through a subsidiary pfizer international bank europe pibe based in dublin ireland pibe incorporated under the laws of ireland operates under a banking license from the central bank of ireland it makes loans and accepts deposits in several currencies in international markets pibe is an active euromarket lender to financially strong borrowers through its portfolio of loans and money market instruments loans are made primarily on a short and mediumterm basis typically with floating interest rates we also own an insurance operation the kodiak company limited which reinsures certain assets inland transport and marine cargo of our international operations financial data for these subsidiaries are set forth in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements banking and insurance subsidiaries  on page 51 of our 2002 annual report and information relating to our banking operations is set forth under the heading banking operation on pages 38 and 39 of our 2002 annual report such data and information are incorporated by reference

employees in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2002 we employed approximately 98000 people in our operations throughout the world 

proposed acquisition of pharmacia corporation in july 2002 we entered into an agreement to acquire pharmacia corporation pharmacia a global pharmaceutical company pharmacia’s human pharmaceuticals include primary care products including celebrex and bextra  which we copromote with pharmacia and detrol   opthalmology care products including xalatan  cancer care products including camptosar  endocrine care products including genotropin  and hospital care products pharmacia also 13 operates several other businesses including animal health and consumer healthcare businesses in december 2002 shareholders of both pfizer and pharmacia approved the proposed acquisition in february 2003 the european commission approved the transaction on march 17 2003 we and pharmacia announced that the companies have reached agreement with the staff of the federal trade commission ftc on the divestitures that will be required in connection with the proposed acquisition and that the companies have agreements in place with buyers for all of the assets to be divested the products and compounds to be divested are not material either individually or in the aggregate to pfizer’s business or operations on march 25 2003 the companies announced that the ftc staff has completed its review and that a proposed consent decree will be forwarded to the ftc for acceptance and placement on the public record based on past ftc practice pfizer anticipates that this process will result in the closing of the transaction in april 2003 the proposed acquisition is a stockforstock transaction valued as of the merger agreement date at approximately 60 billion upon the closing we will issue approximately two billion shares of pfizer common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of pharmacia in addition we will exchange a newly created class of pfizer convertible perpetual preferred stock convertible into approximately 16 million shares of pfizer common stock for a substantially identical class of pharmacia stock and we will exchange options on 14 shares of pfizer common stock for each outstanding pharmacia option see the information under the heading proposed acquisition of pharmacia corporation in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements merger activities  on page 50 of our 2002 annual report such information is incorporated by reference 

cautionary factors that may affect future results   cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995   our disclosure and analysis in this report and in our 2002 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance in particular these include statements relating to future actions prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results   we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements   we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 14 • balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and research and development for future products could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues • in the us many pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures which could be significantly impacted by the outcome of the current national debate over medicare reform if the medicare program provided outpatient pharmaceutical coverage for its beneficiaries the federal government through its enormous purchasing power under the program could demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies that may implicitly create price controls on prescription drugs on the other hand a medicare drug reimbursement provision may increase the volume of pharmaceutical drug purchases offsetting at least in part these potential price discounts in addition mcos medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts government efforts to reduce medicare and medicaid expenses may continue to increase the use of mcos this may result in managed care’s influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population in addition certain states have proposed and certain other states have adopted various programs to control prices for their seniors’ drug programs including price or patient reimbursement constraints restrictions on access to certain products importation from other countries and bulk purchasing of drugs we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue • 359 of our 2002 revenues arose from international operations including 61 from japan these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to interest rate change risk the risks of such changes and the measures we have taken to help contain those risks are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management on pages 40 and 41 of our 2002 annual report for additional details see note 6d to our consolidated financial statements derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  on pages 53 and 54 of our 2002 annual report those sections of our 2002 annual report are incorporated by reference notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses • our international operations also could be affected by changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of products as well as by unstable governments and legal systems intergovernmental disputes and possible nationalization • competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge in the us and is growing internationally expiration or loss of patent protection typically leads to significant loss of sales in the us market the patents covering several of the company’s medicines are being challenged by generic drug manufacturers • risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently 15 uncertain there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products there are also many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements • as discussed above in marketing decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results • difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to build up production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future results • we currently market ten products with annual sales to third parties exceeding 1 billion each lipitor norvasc zoloft neurontin viagra zithromax zyrtec diflucan and our copromoted products celebrex and aricept those products accounted for almost threequarters of our 2002 revenues if these or any of our other major products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from competitive products or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the impact on our revenues could be significant the patents covering lipitor norvasc neurontin diflucan and zoloft are the subject of pending legal challenges an action alleging patent infringement with respect to the sale of celebrex as well as bextra  was dismissed on march 5 2003 the plaintiff in that action has appealed the decision • we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible future effect on our sales products that compete with our drugs including some of our bestselling medicines are launched from time to time and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development some of which have been filed for approval with the fda • growth in costs and expenses changes in product mix and the impact of acquisitions divestitures restructurings product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could affect future results such risks and uncertainties include in particular our ability to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from our proposed acquisition of pharmacia and the increased uncertainty created by the integration of the two businesses as well as our ability to divest and the timing of the divestitures of our remaining discontinued businesses and product lines • our future results could be affected by changes in laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements including taxrate changes new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries • our future results could be affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the threat of future terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas • we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent product liability consumer commercial environmental and tax litigations and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we do not believe any of them will have a material adverse effect on our financial position litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur although we believe we have valid defenses in these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 16 patent claims include challenges to the coverage andor validity of our patents on various products or processes although we believe that we have valid defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations

more than 50 markets for the treatment of neuropathic pain a us filing for this indication was completed in august 2001 geodon known as zeldox in many markets outside the us has been approved in 31 countries for the treatment of symptoms associated with schizophrenia we launched geodon in sweden in 2000 and in the us in the first quarter of 2001 in march 2001 we received an approvable letter from the fda for an intramuscular dosage form of geodon  used to treat agitated or hospitalized patients we have submitted additional data requested by the fda on this formulation and the product is currently under review by the fda we launched zeldox in both the oral and intramuscular formulations in several european countries in march 2002 we copromote aricept  for the treatment of mildtomoderate alzheimer’s disease with eisai co ltd the company that discovered and developed the drug eisai contracted with us to license and copromote the product in the us and several other countries aricept substantially expanded the market for pharmaceutical treatment of that disease in june 2001 the european mutual recognition process was completed for relpax  a treatment for migraines relpax was approved in the eu in dosage levels of 20 mg 40 mg and 80 mg and launches have begun in europe in the fourth quarter of 2000 the fda sent us an approvable letter for relpax in which we were asked to conduct an additional shortterm cardiovascular physiology study we expect to file this study with the fda in 2002   viagra  our medication for the treatment of erectile dysfunction is the most widely prescribed medication in the world for the treatment of this condition our other pharmaceutical products include glucotrol xl  a pancreatic stimulator to produce insulin for the treatment of diabetes and zyrtec  which is used for the treatment of yearround indoor and outdoor allergies and related problems zyrtec is licensed to us by the belgian company ucb sa we copromote zyrtec as a prescription medicine in the us with a subsidiary of ucb sa and we have a license to sell zyrtec as an overthecounter otc medicine under the brand name reactine in certain markets in canada europe australia and south africa see item 3 legal proceedings  below for a discussion of a proceeding before the fda seeking to switch zyrtec from prescription to otc status in the us in the third quarter of 2001 we launched zyrtecd 12hour  an oral antihistamine decongestant combination medicine which treats both indoor and outdoor allergies as well as nasal congestion in february 1999 we participated in the launch of celebrex with gd searle  co a division of pharmacia corporation which discovered and developed celebrex  celebrex is used for the relief of symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis and familial adenomatous polyposis in october 2001 celebrex also was approved in the us for the treatment of acute pain and menstrual pain we copromote celebrex with pharmacia in all world markets except japan   bextra was approved by the fda in november 2001 for the relief of pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis and adult rheumatoid arthritis and for menstrual pain we will copromote bextra with pharmacia which discovered and developed the drug a launch is planned in 2002 on march 21 2000 we announced that we were discontinuing the sale of rezulin  a product acquired in the merger with warnerlambert since march 1997 warnerlambert marketed rezulin in the us with an affiliate of sankyo company ltd from whom we licensed the product for north america and other areas see item 3 legal proceedings  below 3 animal health our animal health group discovers develops manufactures and sells products for the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock and companion animals among the products we market are parasiticides antiinflammatories vaccines antibiotics and related medicines for livestock and companion animals animal health revenues accounted for approximately 3 of our revenues in 2001 4 in 2000 and 5 in 1999 in 2001 animal health revenues declined 3 to 10 billion excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the feedadditive product lines that were sold in november 2000 animal health revenues increased 13 in 2001 the increase was due to the increased sales of revolution  an antiparasitic for companion animals new promotional and distribution practices as well as various restructuring initiatives partially offset by the impact of madcow and footandmouth diseases in europe over the past few years we have substantially increased our investment in research for animal health products we now have over 40 programs advancing at various stages of development emerging products from this investment are expected to reach the market starting in 2004 and drive longterm growth for the animal health group parasiticides constitute the largest segment of the companion animal market consisting mainly of medicines for external parasites such as fleas and heartworm preventatives our product revolution is the first and only topical medicine that protects against fleas and heartworm in a simple onceamonth administration   rimadyl relieves pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis a condition that afflicts about 15 of all dogs the chewable form provides the pet owner with the convenience of onceaday administration capsugel capsugel is the world’s largest producer of twopiece capsules used in manufacturing prescription and otc pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements capsugel’s sales accounted for about 1 of our revenues in each of 2001 2000 and 1999 in 2001 capsugel’s sales increased 1 to 409 million 

consumer products segment our consumer products segment includes our consumer healthcare confectionery shaving and fish products businesses consumer healthcare with 2001 revenues of 24 billion our consumer healthcare division chc markets many of the world’s bestknown consumer health brands sales of chc accounted for about 8 of our revenues in each of 2001 and 2000 and 9 in 1999 in 2001 revenues of chc increased 4 about twice the industry growth rate mainly due to increased sales of sudafed benadryl and listerine mouthwash and the successful launch of listerine pocketpaks in the us in september 2001 partly offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange chc’s products include otc medications and compete primarily in the oral care upper respiratory skin care gastrointestinal and eye care categories among our betterknown brands in the us are  4  several productline extensions building on these brands have been introduced in recent years other products are sold only in selected international markets in the second quarter of 2000 we sold the rid line of licecontrol products to bayer corporation in the fourth quarter of 1999 we sold the bain de soleil suncare product line to scheringplough healthcare products inc chc can extend the life of some of our prescription medications by converting them to otc medications for example an otc formulation of diflucan  known as diflucan one  is sold in the uk as a treatment for vaginal candidiasis similarly zyrtec is sold as an otc product in certain markets outside the us under the brand name reactine  as market conditions permit and when we have necessary approval from drug regulatory authorities we plan to pursue similar launches for other products confectionery products our confectionery division markets a broad range of leading products sales of the confectionery division accounted for about 6 of our revenues in 2001 and 7 in each of 2000 and 1999 in 2001 confectionery sales declined 3 to approximately 20 billion primarily due to increased competition weaker economies in europe canada and other markets and the negative impact of foreign exchange partly offset by the strong performance of dentyne ice in north american markets among our betterknown brands are  shaving products our shaving products business consists of schick and wilkinson sword razors and blades and a range of manicure and toiletry products sales of our shaving products accounted for about 2 of our revenues in 2001 and 3 in each of 2000 and 1999 in 2001 sales of our shaving products declined 7 to 716 million sales declines in olderline products were partly offset by strong sales of the triple blade xtreme 3  which was launched in major european markets in 2001 our betterknown brands are  we sold our barbasol shaving cream brand to perio inc in 2001 fish products tetra is the world’s leading provider of products for the ornamental fish food market including tetramin fish foods and fish care accessories tetra’s sales accounted for less than 1 of our revenues in each of 2001 2000 and 1999 in 2001 tetra’s sales declined 4 to 183 million on march 4 2002 we announced that we are exploring strategic options for tetra including the possible sale of this business 5 

research and product development innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the company’s success our goal is to discover develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs this goal has been supported by our substantial research and development investments we spent approximately 48 billion in 2001 44 billion in 2000 and 40 billion in 1999 on research and development and we anticipate investing approximately 53 billion on research and development in 2002 we are in the process of significantly expanding our research and development operations in 2001 we added approximately 24 million square feet of laboratory and office space at three of our major research centers we currently have approximately 10 million square feet of additional laboratory and office space under construction at two of our major research centers other research facilities are also being added or expanded we conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms we also seek out innovative technologies developed by third parties to acquire or incorporate into our product lines through licensing or other arrangements drug development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take more than ten years drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and products that have been approved and marketed can be ordered to be withdrawn from the market by regulatory authorities we believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number of pharmaceutical compounds and new therapies we have in all stages of development we currently are working on more than 160 projects in development and several hundred projects in research in recent years our discovery scientists have delivered dozens of new chemical compounds to early development while each new candidate is far from regulatory approval new drug candidates are the foundation for future products our research operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them in 2001 for example the fda approved the additional use of zithromax as a singledose and threeday regimen for acute otitis media in children information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the heading product developments on pages 29 and 30 of our 2001 annual report that information is incorporated by reference our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development in addition the consolidation that has occurred in our industry has created companies with substantial research and development resources the extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of sales and unanticipated product obsolescence 

international operations we have significant operations outside the united states they are conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors and involve the same business segments — pharmaceuticals and consumer products — as our us operations revenues from operations outside the us of 123 billion accounted for 38 of our total revenues in 2001 revenues exceeded 500 million in each of seven countries outside the us in 2001 no single country outside the us contributed more than 10 of our total revenues japan is our secondlargest single national market with 7 of our revenues in each of 2001 and 2000 and 6 in 1999 6 for a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues see the table geographic data on page 59 of our 2001 annual report and the table percentage change in geographic revenues on page 26 of our 2001 annual report those tables are incorporated by reference our international businesses are subject in varying degrees to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these include  our international businesses are also subject to governmentimposed constraints including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of products see government regulation and price constraints below for discussion of these matters depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can either improve or reduce the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2001 revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as currency movements relative to the us dollar reduced our reported revenues in many countries changes in foreign exchange rates decreased total revenues by 861 million in 2001 while we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments see note 6d to our financial statements derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  on pages 48 and 49 of our 2001 annual report that discussion is incorporated by reference related information about valuation and risks associated with such financial instruments in parts e and f of that same note is also incorporated by reference 

marketing in our global pharmaceuticals business we promote our products to health care providers such as doctors nurse practitioners physician assistants pharmacists hospitals pharmacy benefit managers pbms and managed care organizations mcos we also market directly to consumers in the united states through directtoconsumer print and television advertising in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public about our innovative medical research our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations each sales organization markets a distinct group of products our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers but we also sell directly to retailers hospitals clinics government agencies and pharmacies through our marketing organizations we explain the approved uses and advantages of our products to medical professionals we work to gain access to health authority pbm and mco formularies lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products and reimbursement lists by demonstrating the qualities and treatment benefits of our products we also work with mcos and pbms to assist them with disease management patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines for example in 2001 we entered into a program with the state of florida agency for health care administration that is designed to help manage chronic diseases among florida’s medicaid population marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals depends to a degree on complex decisions about the scope of clinical trials made years before product approval all drugs must complete clinical trials required by regulatory authorities to show they are safe and effective for treating one or more particular medical problems a manufacturer may choose however to undertake additional studies including comparative clinical trials with competitive products to demonstrate additional advantages of a compound 7 those studies can be costly and take years to complete and the results are uncertain balancing these considerations makes it difficult to decide whether and when to undertake such additional studies but when they are successful such studies can have a major impact on approved marketing claims and strategies separate sales organizations are used by our animal health business to promote its products its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to health professionals directly and through medical journals animal health and nutrition products are sold through veterinarians drug wholesalers distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users where appropriate these products are also marketed through print and television advertising our consumer products businesses primarily use their own representatives to directly promote their products we also use print and television consumer advertising and offer sales incentives such as coupons to promote our consumer products these products are sold through various retailers during 2001 sales to our three largest pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare products wholesalers were  sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the pharmaceuticals segment apart from these instances none of our business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers 

patents and intellectual property rights our products are sold around the world under brandname logo and certain product design trademarks we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms we own or license a number of us and foreign patents these patents cover  patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country in the aggregate our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the united states and most other countries based on current product sales and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by others the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our business as a whole together with the year in which the basic us patent expires are those for the following drugs  8 in some instances there are later expiring patents relating to these products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of further diseases or conditions such patents may not protect the company’s drug from generic drug competition after the expiration of the basic patent   zithromax is patented by pliva a croatian pharmaceutical company the drug is licensed exclusively to us by pliva for sales and marketing in major countries and we purchase the compound in bulk crude form from pliva   celebrex is patented by pharmacia corporation with whom we copromote celebrex in all world markets except japan an action alleging patent infringement with respect to the sale of celebrex is pending against pharmacia the company and others   zyrtec is patented by the belgian company ucb sa and is licensed to us for sales in the us canada europe australia and south africa we copromote zyrtec as a prescription medicine in the us with a subsidiary of ucb sa and have a license to sell zyrtec as an otc medicine in the other markets the basic us patents relating to neurontin expired in 1994 and 2000 however in april 2000 a broad us patent was granted relating to stable pharmaceutical compositions of neurontin containing low levels of lactam impurity this patent expires in 2017 other companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that appear to infringe this patent in addition other companies have filed applications with the fda seeking approval of products that appear to infringe our patents on zoloft  diflucan  accupril  glucotrol xl  procardia xl  estrostep fe and femhrt 15  we have other patent rights covering additional products that have smaller revenues we expect that the patents on some of our newest products and latestage product candidates could become significant to our business as a whole in the future the expiration of a product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the covered product and particularly in the us can result in a significant reduction in sales of the pioneering product in some cases however we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from  the effect of product patent expiration or loss also depends upon  one of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the us is the lack of effective intellectual property protection of our products under international agreements in recent years global protection of intellectual property rights is improving the general agreement on tariffs and trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a tenyear transition period a number of countries are doing this we have experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection improvement see item 3 legal proceedings  below for a discussion of patent litigation 9 

competition competition is intense in all of our businesses and includes many large and small competitors the principal means of competition vary among product categories and business groups technological innovations affecting  are important to success in all of our businesses our businesses also focus on unmet medical needs and therapeutic improvements our emphasis on innovation has led to our multibilliondollar research and development investments over the past decade our human pharmaceutical business competes with other worldwide researchbased drug companies many smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers our pharmaceutical operations are among the largest in the world in recent years a comparison of the total cost of medical treatments using pharmaceuticals versus alternative treatments for the same condition has become an important basis of competition mcos and pbms look to cost advantages as well as medical benefits in making their drug formulary decisions our pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization is a valuable competitive asset our salespeople’s ability to reach medical professionals with information about our products helps us respond to competitive efforts and launch new products we have a significant presence in the animal health marketplace but many other companies offer competitive products altogether there are hundreds of producers of animal health products throughout the world the principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product they include  we promote our products directly through our sales representatives as well as through advertising many other companies large and small manufacture and sell one or more products that are similar to our consumer products sources of competitive advantage include  significant expenditures for advertising promotion and marketing are generally required to achieve both consumer and trade acceptance of consumer products in the current environment of competitive pressures on profit margins we continue efforts to control the growth of our expenses we have kept our costs down in areas such as manufacturing distribution and sales administration by restructuring and consolidating facilities these measures have brought us new efficiencies and reduced or contained our operating expenses managed care organizations the growth of mcos in the us has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the health care marketplace over half the us population now participates in some version of managed care because of the size of the patient population covered by mcos marketing of prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve many of those organizations has become important to our business 10 mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations the purchasing power of mcos has been increasing in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients at the same time those organizations have been consolidating into fewer even larger entities this enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us a major objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce health care expenditures they typically use formularies volume purchases and longterm contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers they use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices they also emphasize primary and preventive care outpatient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive forms of treatment are carefully managed as discussed above in marketing  mcos and pbms typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products due to their generally lower cost generic medicines are often favored the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems mcos use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their formularies exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effects a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price the growth of mcos also appears to have led to greater usage of some drugs the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for more costly treatments such as hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery because of these advantages such drugs can become favored firstline treatments in addition the current trend of some patients to opt for managed care alternatives to medicare may increase overall pharmaceutical usage among that segment of the elderly population medicare does not pay for outpatient use of medicines so patients who do not have another source of prescription drug coverage must bear that cost mcos however often offer drug benefits for their participants these developments have not only created pressure on prices but also have increased sales of products on formularies we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major products included on mco formularies another way we address the interests of mcos is by developing disease management programs these programs can be attractive to mcos by improving patient communications and compliance with dosage directions which are important for effective disease treatment they can help mcos address various aspects of disease management such as prevention diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases including use of pharmaceutical products this comprehensive approach can improve the quality of care and lower costly complications of chronic diseases as noted above in marketing  one such program which we entered into in 2001 with the state of florida agency for health care administration is designed to help manage chronic diseases among florida’s medicaid population generic products one of the biggest competitive challenges that we face in the us and that is growing internationally is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers upon the expiration or loss of 11 us patent protection on a product we can lose the major portion of us sales of that product within a year generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information about the product to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the pioneer product generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the pioneer product this means that after we have borne the expenses of discovering developing and testing a medicine for safety and efficacy obtaining regulatory approval and informing the medical community about its therapeutic benefits generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration of our patent charge much less and still be profitable as noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brandname drugs many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their health care programs including medicaid in the us laws in the us generally allow and in some cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to a brandname drug the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it 

raw materials raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers in general these materials are available from multiple sources no serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2001 and none are expected in 2002 

government regulation and price constraints pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by numerous national state and local agencies of particular importance is the fda in the united states it has jurisdiction over virtually all of our businesses and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness approval manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products fda requirements andor reviews have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market the fda also regulates most of our consumer products and along with the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency our animal health products since 1998 the approval of new drugs across the eu is possible only using the european medicines evaluation agency’s emea mutual recognition or central approval processes the use of either of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval within the 15 member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each member state further on january 1 2000 norway and iceland became full participants in the eu central approval processes in addition the agreement between the eu and 12 other european states to base their approvals on the centralized eu approval will significantly speed the regulatory process in those countries the emea does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in eu member countries however we continue to deal with individual countries on such issues in recent years in the us various legislative proposals have been offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the affected health care systems some states have passed such legislation and further federal and state proposals are possible such proposals and 12 legislation include and future proposals could include price or patient reimbursement constraints on medicines increases in required rebates or discounts and restrictions on access to certain products similar issues exist in many foreign countries where we do business we cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives but we will work to maintain patient access to our products and to oppose price constraints in the us federal proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicare program and federal and state proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicaid program if such changes are enacted they may require significant reductions from currently projected government expenditures for these programs driven by budget concerns medicaid managed care systems have been implemented in many states if the medicare and medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to our innovative medicines our business could be materially affected on the other hand relatively little pharmaceutical use is currently covered by medicare if changes to these programs shift patients to mcos that cover pharmaceuticals or if an outpatient drug benefit is added to medicare usage of pharmaceuticals could increase pricing pressures likely would ensue in either case given the enhancement of the purchasing power of the mcos or the federal government medicare currently does not provide outpatient prescription drug coverage in this context in order to help address the issue of affordable access to health care for those most in need we announced the pfizer for living share card program in january 2002 through this program lowincome medicare recipients without prescription drug coverage can purchase a 30day supply of a pfizer prescription medicine and of the copromoted products zyrtec and aricept at many retail pharmacies for 15 us law requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program some states are seeking rebates in excess of the amounts required by federal law we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs also in late 2000 and early 2001 the states of vermont and maine received centers for medicare and medicaid services approval of waivers that would expand medicaid rebates beyond the current medicaid population both of these waivers have been challenged in court the vermont program was struck down by a federal appeals court in 2001 the maine program was upheld by a federal district court in february 2002 an appeal of that decision is expected if the maine program is upheld on appeal other states may seek similar approval of waivers that would expand medicaid rebates beyond the current medicaid population rebates potentially could be viewed as price discounts without appreciable increases in volume as an offset see the discussion regarding rebates on page 27 of our 2001 annual report which discussion is incorporated by reference we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to inconsistent prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices in addition to the fda the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency we are subject to the jurisdiction of various other regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies such as the department of health and human services the federal trade commission and the department of justice in the us we are therefore subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by those 13 regulatory bodies see item 3 legal proceedings  below such actions may include product recalls seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases we have initiated product recalls voluntarily following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the federal government requested assistance from pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies in connection with the threat of bioterrorism in response we have contributed pfizer antibiotics to the us national stockpile and coordinated with authorities to ensure supplies of essential pharmaceuticals it is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting us 

environmental law compliance most of our manufacturing and certain research operations are affected by federal state and local environmental laws we have made and intend to continue to make necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws we are also cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites see item 3 legal proceedings  below as a result we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2001 for environmental protection and cleanup of certain past industrial activity as follows  while we cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

banking and insurance subsidiaries we conduct international banking operations through a subsidiary pfizer international bank europe pibe based in dublin ireland pibe incorporated under the laws of ireland operates under a banking license from the central bank of ireland it makes loans and accepts deposits in several currencies in international markets pibe is an active euromarket lender to high quality corporations and governments through its portfolio of loans and money market instruments loans are made primarily on a short and medium term basis typically with floating interest rates we also own an insurance operation the kodiak company limited which reinsures certain assets inland transport and marine cargo of our international operations financial data for these subsidiaries are set forth in note 5 to our financial statements banking and insurance subsidiaries  on page 46 of our 2001 annual report and information relating to our banking operations is set forth under the heading banking operation on page 33 of our 2001 annual report such data and information are incorporated by reference

employees in our innovationintensive business our employees are vital to our success we believe we have good relationships with our employees as of december 31 2001 we employed approximately 90000 people in our operations throughout the world 

cautionary factors that may affect future results cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 our disclosure and analysis in this report and in our 2001 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements that 14 set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” and words and terms of similar substance in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance in particular these include statements relating to future actions prospective products or product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10q and 8k reports to the sec also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties • balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge our ongoing investments in new product introductions and research and development for future products could exceed corresponding sales growth this could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues • in the us many pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures which could be significantly impacted by the outcome of the current national debate over medicare reform if the medicare program provided outpatient pharmaceutical coverage for its beneficiaries the federal government through its enormous purchasing power under the program could demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies that may implicitly create price controls on prescription drugs on the other hand a medicare drug reimbursement provision may increase the volume of pharmaceutical drug purchases offsetting at least in part these potential price discounts in addition mcos institutions and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts government efforts to reduce medicare and medicaid expenses are expected to increase the use of mcos this may result in managed care’s influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population in addition certain states have proposed and certain other states have adopted various programs to control prices for their seniors’ drug programs including price or patient reimbursement constraints restrictions on access to certain products importation from other countries and bulk purchasing of drugs we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in europe and some other international markets the government provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement 15 levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system this international patchwork of price regulation has led to inconsistent prices and some thirdparty trade in our products from markets with lower prices such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher prices as a result it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue • thirtyeight percent of our 2001 revenues arose from international operations including 7 from japan and we expect revenue and net income growth in 2002 to be impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates these internationalbased revenues as well as our substantial international assets result in our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in addition our interestbearing investments loans and borrowings are subject to interest rate change risk the risks of such changes and the measures we have taken to help contain those risks are discussed in the section entitled financial risk management on page 35 of our 2001 annual report for additional details see note 6d to our financial statements derivative financial instruments and hedging activities on pages 48 and 49 of our 2001 annual report those sections of our 2001 annual report are incorporated by reference notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances we cannot predict with certainty all changes in currency and interest rates inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses • a european currency euro was introduced in january 1999 to replace the separate currencies of 12 individual countries and did replace such currencies on january 1 2002 we modified systems and commercial arrangements to deal with the new currency including the availability of dual currency processes to permit transactions to be denominated in legacy currencies as well as the euro during the 19992001 transition period the cost of this effort was not material to our financial position or results of operations we continue to evaluate the economic and operational impact of the euro including its impact on competition pricing and foreign currency exchange risks • international operations could be affected by changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of products as well as by unstable governments and legal systems intergovernmental disputes and possible nationalization • costcontainment measures employed by governments that have the effect of limiting patient access to medicines and related issues described above in government regulation and price constraints affect the growth and profitability of our operations in some countries • business combinations among our competitors could affect our competitive position in the pharmaceutical consumer products and animal health businesses similarly combinations among our major customers could increase their purchasing power in dealing with us • competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge in the us and is growing internationally loss of patent protection typically leads to significant loss of sales in the us market the patents covering several of the company’s medicines are being challenged by generic drug manufacturers 16 • risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to productrelated forwardlooking statements the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain there can be no assurance as to if or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products there are also many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around the world regulatory delays the inability to successfully complete clinical trials claims and concerns about safety and efficacy new discoveries patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and productrelated forwardlooking statements • as discussed above in marketing  decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval we try to plan clinical trials prudently but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case the quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results • difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing including but not limited to the inability to build up production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future results • we currently market eight products with annual sales to third parties exceeding 1 billion each lipitor norvasc zoloft neurontin viagra zithromax diflucan and our alliance product celebrex  those products accounted for more than half of our 2001 revenues if these or any of our other major products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from competitive products or if a new more effective treatment should be introduced the impact on our revenues could be significant the patents covering neurontin diflucan and zoloft are the subject of pending legal challenges and an action alleging patent infringement with respect to the sale of celebrex also is pending • we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products or their possible future effect on our sales products that potentially could compete with a number of our drugs including some of our bestselling medicines are in various stages of development and some have been filed for approval with the fda • growth in costs and expenses changes in product mix and the impact of divestitures restructuring product withdrawals and other unusual items that could result from evolving business strategies evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could affect future results for example we may be unable to maintain or further enhance the margin improvements achieved in recent years • on january 1 2002 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 141 business combinations  and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 141 eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 under the provisions of sfas no 142 intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests separable intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives the adoption of sfas no 141 does not impact our financial position or results of operations application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 142 will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations the effect on diluted earnings per share is expected to be less than one cent per share for 2002 we have not yet determined the 17 impact if any of adopting the goodwill impairment provisions of sfas no 142 however we expect to record a charge in the first quarter of 2002 for the impairment provisions as they relate to identifiable intangible assets this charge is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas no 143 addresses financial accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 143 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 143 as of january 1 2003 on january 1 2002 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  that replaces sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of  sfas no 144 requires that longlived assets to be disposed of by sale including those of discontinued operations be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet been incurred sfas no 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction the adoption of sfas no 144 has no impact on our current operations on january 1 2002 we adopted the provisions of the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0025 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor’s products  eitf no 0025 requires the cost of certain vendor consideration to be classified as a reduction of revenue rather than as a marketing expense our adoption of eitf no 0025 will result in reclassifications of certain marketing expenses to reflect them as a reduction of revenues these reclassifications will have no effect on net income from time to time new or revised accounting standards and rules are issued although the standards mentioned above are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations or as noted in one instance we have not yet determined the impact future standards and rules could have such an effect • changes in the us tax code and the tax laws of other countries as well as our effective tax rate for the fiscal year can affect our net earnings during 2001 no major us or international tax legislation was enacted that would materially impact our net earnings it is not possible however to predict the impact on our future results of any tax legislation enacted in the future • our future results could be affected by changes in business political and economic conditions including the cost and availability of insurance due to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the us the threat of future terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas • we are involved in various patent product liability consumer environmental and tax claims and litigations and additional matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business these include challenges to the coverage andor validity of patents on products or processes and allegations of injuries caused by drugs or medical devices in addition we are subject to national state and local environmental laws and regulations we are also involved in or are the subject of governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations from time to time litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts that are not justified by the evidence can occur we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us and taking into account our insurance and reserves we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows it is possible however that cash flows or results of operations could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies 18

 item 3 legal proceedings we are involved in various patent product liability consumer environmental and tax claims and litigations and additional matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business these include challenges to the coverage andor validity of patents on products or processes and allegations of injuries caused by drugs or medical devices in addition we are subject to national state and local environmental laws and regulations we are also involved in or are the subject of governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations from time to time litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts that are not justified by the evidence can occur we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us and taking into account our insurance and reserves we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows it is possible however that cash flows or results of operations could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies among the principal matters pending against us are the following patent litigation generic drug manufacturers generic competition is a major challenge in the us and is growing internationally we are involved in a number of patent suits the majority of which involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products processes or dosage forms are invalid andor do not cover the product of the generic manufacturer in some of these suits the challengers also claim that our assertions of or attempts to enforce rights under our patents 21 constitute unfair competition andor violations of the antitrust laws pending suits include challenges to patents covering among other products sertraline zoloft  gabapentin neurontin  fluconazole diflucan  quinapril accupril  glipizide glucotrol xl  nifedipine procardia xl  estrostep fe oral contraceptive and femhrt 15 hormone replacement therapy a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue could lead to significant loss of sales of that drug in the us market and could affect future results diflucan the patent suit relating to diflucan is pending in the us district court for the northern district of illinois trial is expected in the latter part of 2002 or early 2003 neurontin with respect to neurontin  suits against five generic drug manufacturers are pending in the us district court for the district of new jersey motions for summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent on our stable low  lactam pharmaceutical composition have been filed by two generic manufacturers and await decision any further motions are due to be filed by late june in the event that summary judgment is denied trials of these cases are expected in the latter part of 2002 or early 2003 in these neurontin cases the generic manufacturers have filed counterclaims against us claiming that our assertions of or attempts to enforce rights under our patents constitute unfair competition andor violations of federal and state antitrust laws in october 2001 the ftc requested certain information concerning our gabapentin neurontin patents and their enforcement and we are cooperating with that request in march 2002 a number of suits were filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york one by a health plan on behalf of its members and the others by individuals each of which seeks class action status and each of which alleges that pfizer’s suits to enforce our gabapentin patents against generic manufacturers constitute a violation of the antitrust laws procardia xl a suit involving the patent on nifedipine procardia xl against a generic manufacturer mylan pharmaceuticals was settled in 2000 that settlement has been challenged in several courts under the antitrust laws by another generic manufacturer biovail laboratories and by five health plans the latter seeking class action status on behalf of their members celebrex in 2000 the university of rochester filed a patent infringement action against pfizer gd searle  co inc monsanto co and pharmacia corporation in the u s district court for the western district of new york alleging that sales of celebrex infringe the broad method of use claims of the university’s patent the case is in the pretrial discovery stage products liability matters rezulin the rezulin litigation arises from a diabetes drug developed by sankyo in japan and by warnerlambert rezulin was reported to be prescribed to approximately two million patients the medication treated insulin resistance which is the cause of type 2 diabetes and was effective for many patients whose diabetes had not been controlled with other medications we believe that the fdaapproved labeling and warnings appropriately communicated the risks associated with the medication including the risk of liver injury which occurred in a small percentage of cases 22   rezulin was voluntarily withdrawn in march 2000 following approval of two newer diabetes medications which the fda considered to have similar efficacy and fewer side effects currently more than 2000 suits involving rezulin have been filed in federal and state courts involving approximately 5100 rezulin users substantially all of these suits are at a preliminary stage and consequently we are unable to fully evaluate the claims a number of cases have been settled and a small number have been tried to verdict the cases pending in federal courts have all been consolidated for pretrial proceedings in a single multidistrict litigation assigned to the us district court for the southern district of new york in addition approximately 375 rezulin users have submitted claims to the company but have not filed suits the company has extended the statute of limitations for approximately another 18000 persons who do not have lawsuits on file and may or may not eventually file suits we are opposing class certification in all cases class certification has been denied by state courts in california and west virginia the first two decisions on the issue in another case involving class claims the us district court for the southern district of new york dismissed a complaint by blue crossblue shield of louisiana and other healthbenefit plans to recover money paid for rezulin and liver testing other requests for class certification are pending in various courts we are actively engaged in defending the litigations and where appropriate resolving the litigations and claims as in most multiple tort litigation the cases present a wide variety of claims ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by rezulin to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury at all based on the information available to us only a very small percentage of the claimants can demonstrate any real injury caused by the medication for example at the time the drug was withdrawn there were 90 cases of liver failure reported to the fda that were possibly or probably attributable to rezulin  nor is there any valid scientific basis for concluding that rezulin had any adverse latent effect while we are prepared to pay reasonable compensation to the relatively small number of claimants with injuries demonstrably caused by rezulin  we intend to defend vigorously the vast majority of cases in which the plaintiff’s injuries if any cannot reasonably be attributed to the medication a federal grand jury in maryland has sought documents relating to rezulin from us and testimony from former warnerlambert employees we are cooperating with this investigation asbestos in the 1960s pfizer acquired two businesses the gibsonburg lime products company glpc and quigley company inc that had limited sales of minor products that contained small amounts of chrysotile asbestos and that now form the basis for the company’s asbestos litigation between 1967 and 1982 warnerlambert owned american optical corporation which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing approximately 169000 claims naming pfizer andor quigley and numerous other defendants are currently pending in state and federal courts seeking damages for alleged asbestos exposure because many claimants name both pfizer and quigley despite the fact that their work histories make exposure to both glpc and quigley products highly unlikely the number of claims overstates the number of claimants which we estimate to be approximately 118000 in addition approximately 63000 claimants have named american optical as a defendant based upon available data and our experience in handling asbestos claims we believe that the vast majority of plaintiffs do not have any impairing medical condition for those claimants who do we believe we have meritorious defenses and are defending these cases vigorously 23 since the inception of this litigation pfizer and quigley have closed through settlement for varying amounts or through litigation in excess of 185000 asbestos suits or claims in the same period american optical has closed in excess of 40000 such suits or claims other products liability matters we are also defending claims and lawsuits involving a number of other products in which the relief sought includes money damages on behalf of individuals or claims by purported classes of users of the products who seek money damages injunctive relief andor medical monitoring antitrust matters in 1993 both pfizer and warnerlambert were named together with numerous other manufacturers of brandname prescription drugs and certain companies that distribute brandname prescription drugs in suits in federal and state courts brought by various groups of retail pharmacy companies alleging that the manufacturers violated the sherman act by agreeing not to give retailers certain discounts and that the failure to give such discounts violated the robinson  patman act a class action was brought on the sherman act claim as well as additional actions by numerous individual retail pharmacies and a group of chain and supermarket pharmacies on both the sherman act and robinson  patman act claims that litigation has been largely resolved at both the federal and state levels with the principal exception of a group of approximately 3800 optout claimants from the original federal class action who are continuing to pursue their claims individually in federal court in new york environmental matters our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended “cercla” or “superfund” we have been designated as a potentially responsible party by the united states environmental protection agency with respect to certain waste sites with which we may have had direct or indirect involvement similar designations have been made by some state environmental agencies under applicable state superfund laws such designations are made regardless of the extent of our involvement we own or previously owned several sites for which we may be the sole responsible party there are also claims that we may be a responsible party or participant with respect to several waste site matters in foreign jurisdictions such claims have been made by the filing of a complaint the issuance of an administrative directive or order or the issuance of a notice or demand letter these claims are in various stages of administrative or judicial proceedings they include demands for recovery of past governmental costs and for future investigative or remedial actions in many cases the dollar amount of the claim is not specified in most cases claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same recovery or other relief as was asserted against us we are currently participating in remedial action at a number of sites under federal state local and foreign laws to the extent possible with the limited amount of information available at this time we have evaluated our responsibility for costs and related liability with respect to the above sites and are of the opinion that our liability with respect to these sites should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in arriving at this conclusion we have considered among other things the payments that have been made with respect to the sites in the past the factors such as volume and relative toxicity ordinarily applied to allocate defense and remedial costs at 24 such sites the probable costs to be paid by the other potentially responsible parties total projected remedial costs for a site if known existing technology and the currently enacted laws and regulations we anticipate that a portion of these costs and related liability will be covered by available insurance through our own internal audit procedures during 2001 we became aware of certain practices related to the sampling of waste water at our parsippany nj manufacturing facility which may not comply with regulatory requirements enacted or adopted for the purpose of protecting the environment we voluntarily disclosed our initial detection of potential noncompliance to the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep and to the us environmental protection agency usepa since then we voluntarily disclosed information acquired since the initial disclosure to the njdep further disclosure to the usepa may be required in the future while no formal enforcement proceeding has been initiated it is possible that such a proceeding may be commenced in the future and that civil penalties may be sought other matters neurontin the us attorney’s office in boston massachusetts is conducting an investigation into warnerlambert’s promotion of neurontin  and in 2000 and 2001 certain former employees of warnerlambert were subpoenaed to provide testimony before a federal grand jury it is possible that criminal charges and fines could be sought as a result of this investigation we continue to cooperate with this inquiry in addition a former employee of warnerlambert has commenced a civil lawsuit in federal court in massachusetts against warnerlambert on behalf of the united states under 31 usc 3730 the lawsuit alleges that warnerlambert violated the federal false claims act based on certain alleged sales and marketing practices concerning neurontin  lipitor the department of justice has commenced a civil investigation into warnerlambert’s pricing for lipitor during 1999 and 2000 aimed at determining whether grants made to certain health plans and pbms should be characterized as rebates which would entitle the government to a further discount

zithromax for use in treating pediatric otitis media ear infections we are cooperating with this investigation zyrtec prescriptionotc switch a petition was filed with the fda by blue cross of california a subsidiary of wellpoint health networks in july 1998 requesting that second generation antihistamines and antihistaminedecongestant combination drugs be switched from prescription to otc status the petition specifically targeted zyrtec as well as two other prescription drugs the fda held a public hearing on the matter in 2001 the company filed comments questioning the authority of the fda to take the requested action without affording the sponsor of the nda drugs in question an evidentiary hearing the fda has not yet taken action in the matter securities litigation on july 20 2001 our subsidiary agouron pharmaceuticals inc was served with the first of three related purported class actions brought by shareholders of immune response corp irc in the u s district court for the southern district of california under sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act 25 of 1934 the complaints allege that irc and its chief executive officer and agouron and its former chief executive officer misled the investing public about the status of and prospects for remune  an aids treatment in development that had been licensed by irc to agouron in june 1998 on july 16 2001 agouron had announced that in accordance with the terms of the irc agreement it had determined not to pursue the development of remune  the cases are in the early procedural stages merger litigation warnerlambert and its directors are named as defendants in purported class actions currently pending in delaware chancery court and in federal court in new jersey brought by the former shareholders of warnerlambert these lawsuits allege that warnerlambert’s directors breached their fiduciary duties to warnerlambert andor its shareholders in connection with a merger agreement entered into between warnerlambert and american home products corp which agreement was ultimately terminated in connection with the pfizerwarnerlambert merger the defendants have moved to dismiss the actions
