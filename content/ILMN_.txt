overview 

we are the global leader in sequencing and arraybased solutions for genetic and genomic analysis our products and services serve customers in a wide range of markets enabling the adoption of genomic solutions in research and clinical settings we were incorporated in california in april 1998 and reincorporated in delaware in july 2000 our principal executive offices are located at 5200 illumina way san diego california 92122 our telephone number is 858 2024500 

our customers include leading genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and hospitals as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology commercial molecular diagnostic laboratories and consumer genomics companies 

our portfolio of integrated sequencing and microarray systems consumables and analysis tools is designed to accelerate and simplify genetic analysis this portfolio addresses the range of genomic complexity price points and throughput enabling customers to select the best solution for their research or clinical application 

we have also enabled or invested in earlystage companies that are pursuing promising genomicsrelated technologies for example grail inc grail formed in 2016 was created to develop a blood test for earlystage cancer detection and helix holdings i llc helix was established in 2015 to enable individuals to explore their genetic information by providing sequencing and services for consumers through thirdparty partners 

on november 1 2018 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire pacific biosciences of california inc pacbio for an allcash price of approximately 12 billion or 800 per share subject to applicable regulatory approvals we believe pacbio’s highly accurate long reads combined with our highly accurate and scalable short reads will provide researchers and clinicians with a more perfect view of the genome enhancing their ability to make novel discoveries and broaden clinical utility across a range of applications   the transaction is expected to close mid2019 see note “3 intangible assets goodwill and acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this report for further details regarding this acquisition 

genetics primer 

the instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna the complete set of dna for any organism is referred to as its genome dna contains small regions called genes which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively these nucleotide bases occur in a precise order known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a copy of a portion of its dna sequence called messenger rna mrna is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function the illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic 

variations among organisms are due in large part to differences in their dna sequences changes can result from insertions deletions inversions translocations or duplications of nucleotide bases these changes may result in certain genes becoming overexpressed excessive protein production underexpressed reduced protein production or silenced altogether sometimes triggering changes in cellular function the most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide 

 4 

polymorphism snp which is a base change in a single position in a dna sequence another type of variation copy number variations cnvs occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes segments of a gene or stretches of dna 

in humans genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see eg height hair eye color etc genetic variations also can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease they can affect individuals’ response to certain drug treatments causing them to respond well experience adverse side effects or not respond at all 

scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans as well as in a broad range of animals plants and microorganisms such research takes place in government university pharmaceutical biotechnology and agrigenomics laboratories around the world where scientists expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life beginning at the genetic level our tools are used to elucidate the relationship between gene sequence and biological processes researchers who investigate human and nonhuman genetic variation to understand the mechanisms of disease are enabling the development of more effective diagnostics and therapeutics they also provide greater insight into genetic variation in plants eg food and biofuel crops and animals eg livestock and domestic enabling improvements in crop yields and animal breeding programs 

by empowering genetic analysis and facilitating a deeper understanding of genetic variation and function our tools advance disease research drug development and the creation of molecular diagnostic tests we believe that this will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and health care and that the increased emphasis on preventive and predictive molecular medicine will usher in the era of precision health care 

our principal markets 

our organization is structured to target the markets and customers outlined below 

life sciences 

historically our core business has been in the life sciences research market this includes laboratories associated with universities research centers and government institutions along with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions use our products and services for basic and translational research across a spectrum of scientific applications including targeted exome and wholegenome sequencing genetic variation gene expression epigenetics and metagenomics nextgeneration sequencing ngs technologies are being adopted due to their ability to costeffectively sequence large sample sizes quickly and accurately generating vast amounts of highquality data both private and public funding drive this research along with global initiatives to characterize genetic variation 

our products also serve various applied markets including consumer genomics and agrigenomics for example in consumer genomics our customers use our technologies to provide personalized genetic data and analysis to individual consumers in agrigenomics government and corporate researchers use our products and services to explore the genetic and biological basis for productivity and nutritional constitution in crops and livestock researchers can identify natural and novel genomic variation and deploy genomewide markerbased applications to accelerate breeding and production of healthier and higheryielding crops and livestock 

clinical genomics 

we are focused on enabling translational and clinical markets through the introduction of bestinclass sequencing technology further we are developing sampletoanswer solutions to catalyze adoption in the clinical setting including in reproductive and genetic health and oncology in reproductive health our primary focus is driving noninvasive prenatal testing nipt adoption globally through our technology which identifies fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing cellfree dna in maternal blood our ngs technology is also accelerating rare and undiagnosed disease research to discover the genetic causes of inherited disorders by assessing many genes simultaneously using ngs can reduce costs compared to traditional methods of disease diagnosis which are often expensive and inconclusive while requiring extensive testing 

cancer is a disease of the genome and the goal of cancer genomics is to identify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one understanding these genomic changes will improve diagnostic accuracy increase understanding of the prognosis and enable oncologists to target therapies to individuals customers in the translational and clinical oncology markets use our products to perform research that may help identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to cancer and to identify molecular changes in a tumor we believe that circulating tumor dna ctdna will become an important clinical tool for managing oncology patients during all stages of tumor progression our technology is 

 5 

being used to research the implications of ctdna in treatment determination treatment monitoring minimal residual disease and asymptomatic screening for example we have invested in and partnered with grail which we formed to develop a bloodbased test for earlystage cancer detection that is enabled by our sequencing technology 

our principal products and technologies 

our unique technology platforms support the scale of experimentation necessary for populationscale studies genomewide discovery target selection and validation studies see figure 1 below customers use our products to analyze the genome at all levels of complexity from targeted panels to wholegenome sequencing a large and dynamic illumina user community has published tens of thousands of customerauthored scientific papers using our technologies through rapid innovation we are changing the economics of genetic research enabling projects that were previously considered impossible and supporting clinical advances towards precision medicine 

most of our product sales consist of instruments and consumables which include reagents flow cells and microarrays based on our proprietary technologies we also perform various services for our customers for the fiscal years ended december 30 2018  december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  instrument sales represented 17  19  and 20  respectively of total revenue consumable sales represented 65  64  and 64  respectively of total revenue and services represented 18  17  and 15  respectively of total revenue

sequencing 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases a c g or t in a dna sample our portfolio of sequencing platforms represents a family of systems that we believe set the standard for productivity costeffectiveness and accuracy among ngs technologies customers use our platforms to perform wholegenome de novo exome and rna sequencing and targeted resequencing of specific gene regions and genes 

wholegenome sequencing determines the complete dna sequence of an organism in de novo sequencing the goal is to sequence and assemble the genome of that sample without using information from prior sequencing of that species in targeted resequencing a portion of the sequence of an organism is compared to a standard or reference sequence from previously sequenced samples to identify genetic variation understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between and within species helps us understand the function of the structures encoded in the dna 

our dna sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminatorbased sequencing chemistry referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry sbs tracks the addition of labeled nucleotides as the dna chain is copied in a massively parallel fashion our sbs sequencing technology provides researchers with a broad range of applications and the ability to sequence even large mammalian genomes in a few days rather than weeks or years 

 6 

our sequencing platforms can generate between 500 megabases mb and 60 terabases tb equivalent to approximately 48 human genomes of genomic data in a single run depending on the instrument and application there are different price points per gigabase gb for each instrument and for different applications which range from smallgenome amplicon and targeted genepanel sequencing to populationscale whole human genome sequencing since we launched our first sequencing system in 2007 our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by a factor of more than 10000 in addition the sequencing time per gb has dropped by a factor of approximately 12000 

our basespace informatics suite cloud platform plays a critical role in supporting our sequencing applications basespace informatics suite integrates directly with our sequencing instruments allowing customers to manage their biological sample and sequencing runs process and analyze the raw genomic data and derive meaningful results it facilitates data sharing provides datastorage solutions and streamlines analysis through a growing number of applications developed by us and the bioinformatics community 

for the fiscal years ended december 30 2018  december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  total sequencing revenue comprised 83    83  and   84  respectively of total revenue 

arrays 

arrays are used for a broad range of dna and rna analysis applications including snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression analysis and methylation analysis and enable the detection of millions of known genetic markers on a single array arrays are the primary technology used in consumer genomics applications 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously this facilitates largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique highthroughput costeffective and flexible manner using our beadarray technology we achieve highthroughput analysis via a high density of test sites per array and the ability to format arrays in various configurations to serve the needs of multiple markets and market segments we can vary the size shape and format of the substrate into which the beads selfassemble and create specific bead types for different applications our iscan system and our nextseq 550 system can be used to image arrays 

for the fiscal years ended december 30 2018  december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  total array revenue comprised 17  17  and 16  respectively of total revenue 

consumables 

we have developed various library preparation and sequencing kits to simplify workflows and accelerate analysis our sequencing applications include wholegenome sequencing kits which sequence entire genomes of any size and complexity and targeted resequencing kits which can sequence exomes specific genes rna or other genomic regions of interest our sequencing kits maximize the ability of our customers to characterize the target genome accurately and are sold in various configurations addressing a wide range of applications 

customers use our arraybased genotyping consumables for a wide range of analyses including diverse species diseaserelated mutations and genetic characteristics associated with cancer customers can select from a range of human animal and agriculturally relevant genome panels or create their own custom arrays to investigate millions of genetic markers targeting any species 

our services 

we provide wholegenome sequencing genotyping nipt and product support services human wholegenome sequencing services are provided through our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory using our services customers can perform wholegenome sequencing projects and microarray projects including largescale genotyping studies and wholegenome association studies we also provide nipt services through our partner laboratories that direct samples to us on a test sendout basis in our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory in addition we also offer support services to customers who have purchased our products 

 7 

intellectual property 

we have an extensive intellectual property portfolio as of january 10 2019 we owned or had exclusive licenses to 709 issued us patents and 529 pending us patent applications including 45 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents our issued and pending patents cover various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments digital microfluidics software bioinformatics and chemicaldetection technologies and have terms that expire between 2019 and 2038 we continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies we have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries 

we protect our trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks our success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and processes preserving trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks operating without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and acquiring licenses for technology or products in addition we invest in technological innovation and we seek beneficial licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our sequencing and array technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2019 and 2032 we have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties 

research and development 

 we have historically made substantial investments in research and development our research and development efforts prioritize continuous innovation coupled with product evolution 

research and development expense for the fiscal years ended december 30 2018  december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  were 623 million  546 million  and 504 million  respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2019  to support business growth and continuing expansion in research and productdevelopment efforts 

marketing and distribution 

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe latin america and the asiapacific region in each of these areas dedicated sales service and applicationsupport personnel are expanding and supporting their respective customer bases in addition we sell through lifescience distributors in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region latin america the middle east and south africa we expect to continue increasing our sales and distribution resources during 2019  and beyond as we launch new products and expand our potential customer base 

manufacturing 

we manufacture sequencing and array platforms and reagent kits in 2018  we continued to increase our manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand to address increasing product complexity and volume we continue to automate manufacturing processes to accelerate throughput and improve quality and yield we are committed to providing medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances our key manufacturing and distribution facilities operate under a quality management system certified to iso 13485 

raw materials 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies multiple commercial sources provide many of our components and supplies but there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from singlesource suppliers to manage potential risks arising from singlesource suppliers we believe that if necessary we could redesign our products using alternative components or for use with alternative reagents or develop an internal supply capability in addition while we attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products

competition 

although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect continued intense competition our competitors offer products and services for sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets they include companies such as agilent technologies inc bgi oxford nanopore technologies limited qiagen nv roche holding ag and thermo fisher scientific inc among others some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources than we do along with larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase to compete effectively we must scale our organization and infrastructure appropriately and demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy 

segment and geographic information 

we have two reportable segments core illumina and one segment related to the combined activities of our consolidated vies our consolidated vies currently include only the operations of helix whereas prior to the deconsolidation of grail on february 28 2017 our consolidated vies included the combined operations of helix and grail 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 1554 million  or 47  of total revenue during fiscal 2018  compared to 1241 million  or 45  and 1104 million  or 46  in fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively we consider the us dollar to be the functional currency of our international operations due to the primary activities of our foreign subsidiaries we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note “1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this report for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately 909 million  and 935 million  as of december 30 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom we expect approximately 80 of our backlog as of december 30 2018  to be shipped within the fiscal year ending december 29 2019  although we generally recognize revenue when control of our products and services is transferred 

to our customers some customer contracts might require us to defer revenue recognition beyond the transfer of control 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to various federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe that we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

government regulation 

as we expand product lines to address the diagnosis of disease regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will become an increasingly significant factor in development testing production and marketing products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices or in vitro diagnostic products ivds by the fda and comparable agencies in other countries in the united states certain of our products may require fda clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda the usually shorter 510k clearance process which we used for the fdacleared assays that are run on our fdaregulated miseqdx instrument generally takes from three to six months after submission but it can take significantly longer the longer pma process which we used for our fdacleared ras panel that is also run on our miseqdx instrument is typically much more costly and uncertain it can take from 9 to 18 months after a complete filing but it can take significantly longer and requires conducting clinical studies that are generally more extensive than those required for 510k clearance all of the products that are currently regulated by the fda as medical devices and 

 9 

ivds are also subject to the fda quality system regulation qsr obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals including the fda quality system inspections that are required for pma approval can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

in the us we cannot be certain which of our planned molecular diagnostic products will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process and in fact some of our products will need to go through the pma process the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed may be significantly more expensive than anticipated and may conclude without such products being approved by the fda without timely regulatory approval we will not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products this may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory clearance or approval of our products in addition regulatory agencies may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for us or our customers or both 

if our products labeled as “for research use only” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could be uncertain this is true even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

our products sold as medical devices or ivds in europe will be regulated under the in vitro diagnostics directive 9879ec a new regulation the in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation eu 2017746 the ivdr has been released and will become fully enforceable in 2020 these regulations include requirements for both presentation and review of performance data and qualitysystem requirements 

certain of our products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion not to regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however the fda is reexamining this regulatory approach and changes to the agency’s handling of ldts could impact our business in ways that cannot be predicted at this time in october 2014 the fda published two draft guidance documents suggesting an approach for registration and listing of laboratories and assays along with a framework for regulation of ldts by the fda based on risk to patients rather than whether the ldts were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory the draft framework guidance includes premarket review for higherrisk ldts including many used to guide treatment decisions as well as companion diagnostics that have entered the market as ldts the fda has also issued a 2017 discussion paper on ldts we cannot predict the nature or extent of the fdas final guidance or regulation of ldts in general or with respect to our or our customers’ ldts in particular 

certification of clia laboratories includes standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management and quality control procedures clia also mandates that for high complexity labs such as ours to operate as a lab we must have an accreditation by an organization recognized by clia such as the college of pathologists cap which we have obtained and must maintain if we were to lose our clia certification or cap accreditation our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in addition state laboratory licensing and inspection requirements may also apply to our products which in some cases are more stringent than clia requirements 

  

employees 

as of december 30 2018  we had more than 7300  employees we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this report the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

 10 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new   products 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on developing and commercializing new products and services including improving our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers invest time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products there can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

 we may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace 

  

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and continued substantial increases in the use of sequencing as the cost of sequencing declines 

our products are designed for use in the life sciences diagnostic agricultural pharmaceutical and consumer genomics industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in clinical research and consumer applications we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation or biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are relatively new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach what we expect to be their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into valuable information in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect 

the introduction of nextgeneration sequencing technologies including ours has reduced the cost of sequencing by a factor of more than 10000 and reduced the sequencing time per gb by a factor of approximately 12000 consequently demand for sequencingrelated products and services has increased substantially as new applications are enabled and more sequencing is done in connection with existing applications if as we expect the cost of sequencing continues to fall over time we cannot be sure that the demand for related products and services will increase at least proportionately as new applications are enabled or more sequencing is done in connection with existing applications in the future if demand for our products and services due to lower sequencing costs is less than we expect our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

 11 

if we do not successfully manage the development manufacturing and launch of new products or   services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely   affected 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions transition requirements or programs with respect to newlylaunched products or products in development which could adversely affect sales of our existing products if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle we may delay the product launch date the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or a lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as we announce future products or integrate new products into our portfolio such as new instruments or instrument platforms we face numerous risks relating to product transitions and the evolution of our product portfolio we may be unable to accurately forecast new product demand and the impact of new products on the demand for current or established products we may experience challenges relating to managing excess and obsolete inventories managing new or higher product cost structures and managing different sales and support requirements announcements of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing our current or established products until new products become available in addition customers may defer or stop purchasing our current or established products as they assess the features and technological characteristics of new products as compared to our current or established products before making a financial commitment if customers elect to purchase newlyintroduced products rather than established products revenue recognition on such purchases may be delayed because the availability of newlyintroduced products is generally constrained compared to established products as we scaleup manufacturing sales and support requirements for newlyintroduced products our failure to effectively manage the evolution of our product portfolio including product transitions or introductions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for some of our products or subassemblies components and materials   used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are   delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the products components or materials supplied do   not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our   products in a timely manner or at all 

the complex nature of our products requires customized precisionmanufactured subassemblies components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some subassemblies components and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these subassemblies components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or at satisfactory qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products in whole or in part or develop these capabilities internally and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms in addition the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier the time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields any of which would negatively impact our operating results accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the products subassemblies components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the democratic republic of the congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production or increase our costs any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our planned acquisition the acquisition of pacific biosciences of california inc pacbio may not occur in the expected time frame which may negatively affect the benefits we expect to obtain from the transaction and increase transaction costs or may not occur at all 

the agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement for the acquisition contains customary representations warranties indemnities and closing conditions including the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the

hartscott rodino antitrust improvements act the hsr act and receipt of any other required antitrust approvals in foreign jurisdictions we have received a request for additional information and documentary material often referred to as a “second request” from the federal trade commission ftc in connection with the merger agreement consummation of the acquisition is conditioned on expiration of the waiting period applicable under the hsr act among other conditions the effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period under the hsr act until 30 days after all parties to the merger agreement have substantially complied with the second request unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the ftc or the parties and the ftc voluntarily extend the waiting period the ftc and governmental authorities in foreign jurisdictions have broad discretion in administering governing laws and regulations and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the acquisition including other potential transactions in the life sciences industry or other industries these governmental authorities may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent or otherwise seek to prevent the acquisition we currently anticipate closing the acquisition in mid2019 assuming receipt of required antitrust approvals if the acquisition is not completed within the expected time frame such delay could result in additional transaction costs termination fees loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the acquisition a delay in the acquisition could adversely affect our ability to obtain the benefits we expect from the acquisition and a failure to close the acquisition would deny us those expected benefits entirely 

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 

we compete with thirdparties that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a wide range of technologies in some cases we compete for the resources our customers allocate for purchasing a wide range of products used to analyze genetic variation and biological function some of which are complementary or adjacent to our own but not directly competitive in other cases our products face direct competition as customers choose among products that are designed to address similar applications or needs we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render one or more of our technologies obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines more focused product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences clinical genomics and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

the market for clinical and diagnostic products in particular is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise for example the market for noninvasive prenatal testing is rapidly developing and if our competitors are able to develop and commercialize products superior to or less expensive than ours our business could be adversely impacted established clinical and diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests potentially creating a competitive advantage for them 

if defects are discovered in our products we may incur additional unforeseen costs our products may be subject to recalls customers may not purchase our products our reputation may suffer and ultimately our   sales and operating earnings could be negatively   impacted 

our products incorporate complex precisionmanufactured mechanical parts electrical components optical components and fluidics as well as computer software any of which may contain errors or failures especially when first introduced in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products in addition new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that despite testing are discovered only after commercial shipment defects or errors in our products may discourage customers from purchasing our products the costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating margins identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and thirdparty components may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur because our products are designed to be used to perform complex genomic analysis we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects if we do not meet applicable regulatory or quality standards our products may be subject to recall and under certain circumstances we may be required to notify 

 13 

applicable regulatory authorities about a recall if our products are subject to recall or shipment holds our reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

as we develop market or sell diagnostic tests we may encounter delays in receipt or limits in the amount of reimbursement approvals and public health funding which will impact our ability to grow revenues in the healthcare market 

physicians and patients may not order diagnostic tests that we develop market sell or enable such as our prenatal tests unless thirdparty payors such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid and governmental payors outside of the united states pay a substantial portion of the test price thirdparty payors are often reluctant to reimburse healthcare providers for the use of medical tests that involve new technologies or provide novel diagnostic information in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly limiting reimbursement coverage for medical diagnostic products and in many instances are exerting pressure on diagnostic product suppliers to reduce their prices reimbursement by a payor may depend on a number of factors including a payors determination that tests using our technologies are 

 since each thirdparty payor often makes reimbursement decisions on an individual patient basis obtaining such approvals is a timeconsuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical data supporting the clinical benefits of each of our products as a result there can be no assurance that reimbursement approvals will be obtained this process can delay the broad market introduction of new products and could have a negative effect on our results of operations as a result thirdparty reimbursement may not be consistent or financially adequate to cover the cost of diagnostic products that we develop market or sell this could limit our ability to sell our products or cause us to reduce prices which would adversely affect our results of operations 

even if our tests are being reimbursed thirdparty payors may withdraw their coverage policies cancel their contracts with our customers at any time review and adjust the rate of reimbursement require copayments from patients or stop paying for our tests which would reduce our revenues in addition insurers including managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid have increased their efforts to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services these measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization for the clinical laboratory industry reductions in the reimbursement rate of payors may occur in the future reductions in the prices at which our tests are reimbursed could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

litigation other proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property   infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent   us from selling our products or services 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets or introduce new products we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual impact of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products or services and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products or services in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins and earnings per share in 

 14 

addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue 

the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable other programs such as defense entitlement programs or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities such as the us national institute of health or nih past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced nih and other research and development allocations any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we   may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or   technologies 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

 15 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing or service capacity and develop and maintain   operation of our manufacturing or service capability we may not be able to launch or support   our products or services in a timely manner or at all 

we continue to increase our manufacturing and service capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing and service capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing and service capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments consumables and products that contain dna and enzymes we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically or prevent us from achieving expected performance levels any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

an interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials due to a catastrophic disaster or infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and the san francisco bay area in california madison wisconsin and singapore these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products in addition if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 

many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis could be adversely impacted and we could be prevented from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional   personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

our future success depends upon the continuing services of members of our senior management team and scientific and engineering personnel the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing software engineering sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science and technology companies universities and research institutions competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco areas is intense and the turnover rate can be high moreover changes in immigration policies laws and regulations in the united states or other jurisdictions may make it more difficult for us to hire and retain members of management and scientific and engineering personnel failure to attract and retain management and scientific and engineering personnel could prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use sharebased compensation including restricted stock units and performance stock units to attract key personnel incentivize them to remain with us and align their interests with ours by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our   competitive position 

the proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences genomics forensics agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our proprietary position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain 

 16 

patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against thirdparty claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies in that regard certain patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information 

our strategic investments and joint ventures may result in losses 

we periodically make strategic investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business in addition we periodically form companies such as helix that remain consolidated within our financial statements but receive substantial funding from thirdparty investors who are granted certain control and governance rights the market values of these strategic investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses related to our investment this could result in future charges to our earnings it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any longterm benefits associated with these strategic investments 

security breaches including with respect to cybersecurity and other disruptions could compromise our information products and services disrupt our operations and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions 

as a leader in the field of genetic analysis we may face cyberattacks that attempt to penetrate our network security including our data centers sabotage or otherwise disable our research products and services including instruments at our customers’ sites misappropriate our or our customers and partners proprietary information which may include personally identifiable information or cause interruptions of our internal operations systems and services any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disruption disclosure or other loss of information could result in an adverse impact on our business legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and damage to our reputation 

 17 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government   regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may   be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

our products are not subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis treatment or prevention of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as our fdaregulated miseqdx certain of our products will become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable international agencies including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

diagnostic products are regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable international agencies and may require either clearance from the fda following the 510k premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition if our products labeled as “for research use only not for use in diagnostic procedures” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could change or be uncertain even if such use by our customers is without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

if the fda requires in the future that any of our ldt products be subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion not to regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however the fda has been reconsidering its enforcement discretion policy and has commented that regulation of ldts may be warranted because of the growth in the volume and complexity of testing services utilizing ldts in october 2014 the fda published two draft guidance documents suggesting an approach for registration and listing of laboratories and assays along with a framework for regulation of ldts by the fda based on risk to patients rather than whether the ldts were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory the draft framework guidance includes premarket review for higherrisk ldts including many used to guide treatment decisions as well as companion diagnostics that have entered the market as ldts we cannot predict the nature or extent of the fdas final guidance or regulation of ldts in general or with respect to our ldts in particular if the fda requires in the future that ldt products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

if product or service liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us we may face reduced demand for our products and incur significant liabilities 

our products and services are used for sensitive applications and we face an inherent risk of exposure to product or service liability claims if our products or services are alleged to have caused harm resulted in false negatives or false positives or do not perform in accordance with specifications product liability claims filed against us or against third parties to whom we may have an obligation could be costly and timeconsuming to defend and result in substantial damages or reputational risk we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully defend any product or service liability lawsuit brought against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome product or service liability claims may result in 



 18 

 although we carry product and service liability insurance if we become the subject of a successful product or service liability lawsuit our insurance may not cover all substantial liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

doing business internationally especially in emerging markets creates operational risk for our   business 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe the asiapacific region and brazil as well as manufacturing and research facilities in singapore and the united kingdom shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 47  45  and 46  of our total revenue for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

we are subject to the following risks and challenges associated with conducting business in foreign jurisdictions particularly emerging international markets where we expect a growing proportion of our business to be located 

 additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

as we continue to expand our business into multiple international markets our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations any of these 

 19 

risks could harm our international operations and negatively impact our sales adversely affecting our business results of operations financial condition and growth prospects 

we are exposed to risks associated with transactions denominated in foreign currency 

during 2018  a significant portion of our international sales were denominated in foreign currencies while the majority of our purchases of raw materials were denominated in us dollars changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able to sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations recent global financial conditions have led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

significant developments stemming from the us administration or the uk’s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us 

the us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements and is imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the united states changes in us or foreign political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business the prospect of such changes has already affected and may continue to affect the timing of customer purchases 

additionally on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union or eu this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom’s referendum in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the united kingdom these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the united kingdom’s actual or threatened withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax policies laws regulations or rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation location of operations changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the us internal revenue service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken on our tax returns we could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if material payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

 20 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be   able to sustain operating profitability 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the timing and availability of our customers’ funding the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final weeks of the quarter in light of that our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter delays related to our manufacturing and shipping operations during this time period could delay the recognition of revenue 

a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel to meet the anticipated growth in our business we may incur fixed expenses such as costs related to facility expansions before we generate revenue sufficient to fully support such expenses in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars to support our anticipated growth accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash sharebased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect periodtoperiod changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quartertoquarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

we may not be able to convert our order backlog into revenue 

our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products we may not receive revenue from some of these orders and the order backlog we report may not be indicative of our future revenue many events can cause an order to be delayed or not completed at all some of which may be out of our control if we delay fulfilling customer orders or if customers reconsider their orders those customers may seek to cancel or modify their orders with us customers may otherwise seek to cancel or delay their orders even if we are prepared to fulfill them if our orders in backlog do not result in sales our operating results may suffer 

disruption of critical information technology systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could have an adverse effect on our operations business customer relations and financial condition 

information technology it systems help us operate efficiently interface with customers maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our consolidated financial statements it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including product manufacturing and supply chain sales forecast order fulfillment and billing customer service logistics and management of financial reports and data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures power loss natural disasters human acts terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences disruption of our operations which could harm our reputation and financial results 

 21 

if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper it infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach if our data management systems do not effectively collect store process and report relevant data for the operation of our business whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints software deficiencies or human error our ability to effectively plan forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired any such impairment could adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results 

as we continuously adjust our workflow and business practices and add additional functionality to our enterprise resource planning software and other software applications problems could arise that we have not foreseen including interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments   by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our   financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments in particular accounting rules related to companies that we form together with or that receive substantial funding from thirdparty investors such as helix are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could   reduce demand for our products or services 

our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops other food sources and other living organisms the information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information including preimplantation genetic screening of embryos prenatal genetic testing genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions particularly for those that have no known cure governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses 

as of december 30 2018  we had 633 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2019 517 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2021 and 750 million  aggregate principle amount of convertible notes due 2023 outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 29  with respect to convertible notes due 2019 35  with respect to convertible notes due 2021 and 37  with respect to convertible notes due 2023 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 

 22 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include antitakeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us our certificate of incorporation has provisions that give our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 

in addition certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law dgcl including section 203 of the dgcl may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina section 203 of the dgcl provides with certain exceptions for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15 and less than 85 of the voting stock exclusive of stock held by directors officers and employee plans of a company 

the above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock

about illumina 

we have two reportable segments illumina’s core operations core illumina and one segment related to the activities of our consolidated vies our consolidated vies currently include only the operations of helix whereas prior to the grail deconsolidation on february 28 2017 our consolidated vies included the combined operations of helix and grail for information on helix and grail refer to note “2 balance sheet account details” and note “10 segment information and geographic data” in part ii item 8 of this report 

our focus on innovation has established us as the global leader in dna sequencing and arraybased technologies serving customers in the research clinical and applied markets our products are used for applications in the life sciences oncology reproductive health agriculture and other emerging segments 

our customers include a broad range of academic government pharmaceutical biotechnology and other leading institutions around the globe 

our comprehensive line of products addresses the scale of experimentation and breadth of functional analysis to advance disease research drug development and the development of molecular tests this portfolio of leadingedge sequencing and arraybased solutions addresses a range of genomic complexity and throughput enabling researchers and clinical practitioners to select the best solution for their scientific challenge 

on november 1 2018 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire pacific biosciences of california inc pacbio for an allcash price of approximately 12 billion or 800 per share subject to applicable regulatory approvals we believe pacbio’s highly accurate long reads combined with our highly accurate and scalable short reads will provide researchers and clinicians with a more perfect view of the genome enhancing their ability to make novel discoveries and broaden clinical utility across a range of applications the transaction is expected to close mid2019 see note “3 intangible assets goodwill and acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this report for further details regarding this acquisition 

financial overview 

consolidated financial highlights include the following 

  

 

 27 

 

 

 

our future effective tax rate may vary from the us federal statutory tax rate due to the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor “we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions” in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this report we may also be adversely impacted in the future if the tax court opinion regarding the exclusion of stock compensation from costsharing charges is overturned we anticipate that our future effective tax rate will remain lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 21 due to the portion of our earnings that will be subject to lower statutory tax rates

results of operations 

to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 30 2018  december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  stated as a percentage of total revenue 



percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 were all 52 weeks 

revenue 



 29 

other product revenue consists primarily of freight service and other revenue consists primarily of sequencing and genotyping service revenue as well as instrument service contract revenue total revenue primarily relates to core illumina for all periods presented 

2018 compared to 2017 

the increase in consumables revenue in 2018  was primarily due to a 338 million  increase in sequencing consumables revenue driven primarily by growth in the instrument installed base instruments revenue increased  in 2018  primarily due to a  48 million  increase in sequencing instruments revenue driven by increased shipments of our novaseq and nextseq instruments partially offset by fewer shipments of our hiseq instrument service and other revenue increased  in 2018 as a result of increased revenue from sequencing services codevelopment agreements and genotyping services 

2017 compared to 2016 

the increase in consumables revenue in 2017 was primarily due to a 197 million increase in sequencing consumables revenue driven by growth in the sequencing instrument installed base instruments revenue increased in 2017 primarily due to a 34 million increase in sequencing instruments revenue due to shipments of our novaseq instrument introduced in q1 2017 partially offset by lower shipments of our hiseq and hiseq x instruments the increase in service and other revenue in 2017 was driven by revenue from genotyping services and extended instrument service contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base 

  gross margin 



2018 compared to 2017 

the gross margin increase in 2018 was driven primarily by an increase in consumables as a percentage of total revenue which generate higher gross margins and an 18 million impairment of an acquired intangible asset and inventory reserves related to product transitions that were recorded in 2017 

2017 compared to 2016 

the gross margin decrease in 2017 was driven by a variety of factors including an 18 million impairment of an acquired intangible asset an increase in lowermargin array services mix inventory reserves related to product transitions and lower instrument margin from the novaseq introduction 

operating expense 



  

2018 compared to 2017 

core illumina rd expense increased by 78 million  or 15  primarily due to increased headcount as we continue to invest in the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products and an increase in performancebased compensation rd expense of our consolidated vies decreased by 1 million  primarily due to the deconsolidation of grail in q1 2017 partially offset by the growth in helix’s operations 

 30 

core illumina sga expense increased by 125 million  or 20  primarily due to increased headcount and investments in facilities to support the continued growth and scale of our operations and an increase in performancebased compensation sga expense of our consolidated vies decreased by 5 million  primarily due to the deconsolidation of grail in q1 2017 partially offset by the growth of helixs operations 

  

2017 compared to 2016 

core illumina rd expense increased by 58 million or 13 primarily due to increased headcount as we continue to invest in the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products rd expense of our consolidated vies decreased by 16 million primarily due to the deconsolidation of grail in q1 2017 partially offset by growth in helix’s operations 

core illumina sga expense increased by 73 million or 13 primarily due to increased headcount and facilities investments to support the continued growth and scale of our operations sga expense of our consolidated vies increased by 17 million due to marketing expenses related to helix’s july 2017 platform launch and increased headcount as well as performancebased compensation related to the grail series b financing these results were partially offset by the deconsolidation of grail in q1 2017 

legal contingencies in 2016 represented a reversal of previously recorded expense related to the settlement of patent litigation 

other income expense net 



other income expense net primarily relates to core illumina for all periods presented 

2018 compared to 2017 

interest income increased in 2018  compared to 2017  as a result of higher yields on our investments and higher cash and cashequivalent balances interest expense consisted primarily of accretion of discount on our convertible senior notes and interest recorded on our financing obligations related to our buildtosuit properties other income expense net in 2018 consisted primarily of marktomarket adjustments and impairments from our strategic investments other income expense net decreased in 2018  primarily due to a 453 million gain recorded on the deconsolidation of grail in q1 2017 

2017 compared to 2016 

interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of higher yields on our investments and higher savings and money market balances interest expense consisted primarily of accretion of discount on our convertible senior notes other income expense net increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a 453 million gain recorded on the deconsolidation of grail in q1 2017 and an increase in net foreign exchange gains

provision for income taxes 



2018 compared to 2017 

in 2018 the us federal statutory rate was reduced from 35 to 21 in 2018 the variance from the us federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily impacted by the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation offset partially by the 11 million tax expense associated with updating prior year estimates of the impact of us tax reform in 2017 the effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory rates from the us federal statutory rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation such impacts were offset primarily by the provisional estimated impact of us tax reform of 150 million the impact of us tax reform primarily represented our provisional estimate of the onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the impact of revaluing our us deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the statutory rates at which they are expected to be recognized in the future which for federal purposes was reduced from 35 to 21 

2017 compared to 2016 

in 2017 the effective tax rate was equivalent to the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 and was primarily impacted by the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation such impacts were offset primarily by the provisional estimated impact of us tax reform of 150 million the impact of us tax reform primarily represented our provisional estimates of the onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the impact of revaluing our us deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the statutory rates at which they are expected to be recognized in the future which for federal purposes was reduced from 35 to 21 in 2016 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory rates from the us federal statutory rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom partially offset by the tax impact associated with the investment in our consolidated variable interest entities 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 30 2018  we had approximately 11 billion  in cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 487 million  was held by our foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents held by helix as of december 30 2018  were 24 million  cash and cash equivalents decreased  by 81 million  from last year due to the factors described in the “cash flow summary” below our primary source of liquidity other than our holdings of cash cash equivalents and investments has been cash flows from operations and from time to time issuances of debt our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest the historical earnings of our foreign subsidiaries generated prior to 2017 as of december 30 2018  we asserted that 63 million  of foreign earnings would not be indefinitely reinvested 

historically we have liquidated our shortterm investments andor issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities as of december 30 2018  we had 24 billion  in shortterm investments   including 103 million  held by helix our shortterm investments are predominantly comprised of marketable securities consisting of us governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities 

in august 2018 we issued convertible senior notes due 2023 2023 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 750 million the net proceeds from the issuance after deducting the offering expenses payable by us were 735 million we used a portion of the net proceeds to repurchase 103 million of our common stock concurrently with the offering the 2023 notes mature on august 15 2023 and were not convertible as of december 30 2018  

  

 32 

our convertible senior notes due in 2019 and 2021 became convertible at the option of the holders on october 1 2018 and continued to be convertible through december 31 2018 however effective january 1 2019 these convertible senior notes were no longer convertible regardless the notes due in 2019 become convertible at any time on or after march 15 2019 until june 13 2019 and mature on june 15 2019 it is our intent and policy to settle conversions of the notes through combination settlement this involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the principal amount and delivery of the excess of conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common stock 

we anticipate that our current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash provided by operating activities are sufficient to fund our nearterm capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months including the pending acquisition of pacbio for a price of approximately 12 billion in cash as described above operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include 

   

 authorizations to repurchase 49 million  of our common stock remained available as of december 30 2018  on february 6 2019 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program which supersedes all prior and available repurchase authorizations to repurchase 550 million  of outstanding common stock the repurchases may be completed under a 10b51 plan or at management’s discretion 

certain noncontrolling helix investors may require illumina to redeem certain noncontrolling interests in cash at the then approximate redemption fair market value such redemption right is exercisable at the option of certain noncontrolling interest holders after january 1 2021 provided that a bona fide pursuit of the sale of helix has occurred and an initial public offering of helix has not been completed the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests related to helix as of december 30 2018  was 61 million  

we had 69 million  remaining in our capital commitment to a venture capital investment fund as of december 30 2018  

we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing services and instrument service contracts 

we recognize revenue when control of our products and services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive from our customers in exchange for those products and services this process involves identifying the contract with a customer determining the performance obligations in the contract determining the contract price allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied a performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract we consider a performance obligation satisfied once we have transferred control of a good or service to the customer meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the good or service 

revenue from product sales is recognized generally upon delivery to the end customer which is when control of the product is deemed to be transferred invoicing typically occurs upon shipment and payment is typically due within 60 days from invoice in instances where right of payment or transfer of title is contingent upon the customer’s acceptance of the product revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered typically evenly over the contract term revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer 

revenue is recorded net of discounts distributor commissions and sales taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities employee sales commissions are recorded as selling general and administrative expenses when incurred as the amortization period for such costs if capitalized would have been one year or less 

 36 

we regularly enter into contracts with multiple performance obligations revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the separate satisfaction of each distinct performance obligation within the contract most performance obligations are generally satisfied within a short time frame approximately three to six months after the contract execution date 

the contract price is allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to its standalone selling price we determine our best estimate of standalone selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient we rely upon prices set by management adjusted for applicable discounts 

in certain markets products and services are sold to customers through distributors in most sales through distributors the product is delivered directly to customers by us the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers 

investments 

we invest in various types of securities including debt securities in governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities us treasury securities and equity securities as of december 30 2018  we had 24 billion  in shortterm investments   including 103 million  held by helix we classify our investments as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 

as discussed in note “4 fair value measurements” in part ii item 8 of this report approximately half  of our security holdings have been classified as level 2 these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a thirdparty service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly such as yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings and in the process we apply judgment and estimates that if changed could significantly affect our statement of financial positions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycles quality issues historical experience and usage forecasts we record writedowns of inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that may supersede old ones however if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory writedowns could be required 

contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assess on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the consolidated financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors which include but 

 37 

are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates resulting in a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the fair values assigned defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets net of liabilities assumed as goodwill 

management typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we perform regular reviews to determine if the carrying values of our longlived assets are impaired a review of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment if indicators of impairment exist we assess the recoverability of the affected longlived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts 

in order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows the time value of money and other factors that a willing market participant would consider significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

sharebased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

the determination of fair value of sharebased awards requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected life of an award expected dividends the riskfree interest rate and forecast of our future financial performance in the case of performance stock units we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the volatility we project over the estimated expected life of our stock awards adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the 

 38 

terms and conditions of the stock awards we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards we update our forecast of future financial performance periodically which impacts our estimate of the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the outstanding performance stock units we amortize the fair value of sharebased compensation on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards if any of the assumptions used change significantly sharebased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

warranties 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on instruments additionally we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve and adjust if necessary the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of our future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined

interest rate sensitivity 

our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates the fair market value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investmentgrade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interestsensitive financial instruments

changes in interest rates may impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes in june 2014 we issued 633 million  aggregate principal amount of 0  convertible senior notes due 2019 2019 notes and 517 million  aggregate principal amount of 05  convertible senior notes due 2021 2021 notes in august 2018 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 0 convertible senior notes due 2023 2023 notes at our election the notes are convertible into cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price at 130 above the conversion price the notes become convertible upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our thencurrent incremental borrowing rate if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted the implicit interest rates for the 2019 2021 and 2023 notes were 29  35  and 37  respectively an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of 100 million aggregate principal amount of each of the 2019 2021 and 2023 notes would result in losses of approximately 1 million  2 million  and 4 million  respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than our us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro japanese yen australian dollar and canadian dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income 

we use forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the gains or losses from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities as of december 30 2018  the total notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was 122 million

overview 

we are the global leader in sequencing and arraybased solutions for genetic analysis our products and services serve customers in a wide range of markets enabling the adoption of genomic solutions in research and clinical settings we were incorporated in california in april 1998 and reincorporated in delaware in july 2000 our principal executive offices are located at 5200 illumina way san diego california 92122 our telephone number is 858 2024500 

our customers include leading genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and hospitals as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology commercial molecular diagnostic laboratories and consumer genomics companies 

our portfolio of integrated sequencing and microarray systems consumables and analysis tools is designed to accelerate and simplify genetic analysis this portfolio addresses the range of genomic complexity price points and throughput enabling customers to select the best solution for their research or clinical challenge 

we have also enabled or invested in earlystage companies that are pursuing promising genomicsrelated technologies for example grail inc grail formed in 2016 was created to develop a blood test for earlystage cancer detection and helix holdings i llc helix was established in 2015 to enable individuals to explore their genetic information by providing sequencing and services for consumers through thirdparty partners helix is a consolidated variable interest entity vie and grail was deconsolidated in february 2017 

genetics primer 

the instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna the complete set of dna for any organism is referred to as its genome dna contains small regions called genes which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively these nucleotide bases occur in a precise order known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a copy of a portion of its dna sequence called messenger rna mrna is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function the illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic 

variations among organisms are due in large part to differences in their dna sequences changes can result from insertions deletions inversions translocations or duplications of nucleotide bases these changes may result in certain genes becoming overexpressed excessive protein production underexpressed reduced protein production or silenced altogether sometimes triggering changes in cellular function these changes can be the result of heredity but most often they occur at random the most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide polymorphism snp which is a base change in a single position in a dna sequence another type of variation copy number variations cnvs occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes segments of a gene or stretches of dna

in humans genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see eg height hair eye color etc genetic variations also can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease they can affect individuals’ response to certain drug treatments causing them to respond well experience adverse side effects or not respond at all 

scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans as well as in a broad range of animals plants and microorganisms such research takes place in government university pharmaceutical biotechnology and agrigenomics laboratories around the world where scientists expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life beginning at the genetic level our tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes researchers who investigate human viral and bacterial genetic variation to understand the mechanisms of disease are enabling the development of more effective diagnostics and therapeutics they also provide greater insight into genetic variation in plants eg food and biofuel crops and animals eg livestock and domestic enabling improvements in crop yields and animal breeding programs 

by empowering genetic analysis and facilitating a deeper understanding of genetic variation and function our tools advance disease research drug development and the creation of molecular diagnostic tests we believe that this will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and health care and that the increased emphasis on preventive and predictive molecular medicine will usher in the era of precision health care 

our principal markets 

our organization is structured to target the markets and customers outlined below 

life sciences 

historically our core business has been in the life sciences research market this includes laboratories associated with universities research centers and government institutions along with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions use our products and services for basic and translational research across a spectrum of scientific applications including targeted exome and wholegenome sequencing genetic variation gene expression epigenetics and metagenomics nextgeneration sequencing ngs technologies are being adopted due to their declining costs per sample and their ability to sequence large sample sizes quickly and accurately generating vast amounts of highquality data both private and public funding drive this research along with global initiatives to characterize genetic variation 

our products also serve various applied markets including consumer genomics and agrigenomics for example in consumer genomics our customers use our technologies to provide personalized genetic data and analysis to individual consumers in agrigenomics government and corporate researchers use our products and services to explore the genetic and biological basis for productivity and nutritional constitution in crops and livestock researchers can identify natural and novel genomic variation and deploy genomewide markerbased applications to accelerate breeding and production of healthier and higheryielding crops and livestock 

clinical genomics 

we are focused on enabling translational and clinical markets through the introduction of bestinclass sequencing instruments and reagents further we are developing sampletoanswer solutions to catalyze adoption in the clinical setting including in reproductive and genetic health and oncology in reproductive health our primary focus is driving noninvasive prenatal testing nipt adoption globally through our technology which identifies fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing cellfree dna in maternal blood our ngs technology is also accelerating rare and undiagnosed disease research to discover the genetic causes of inherited disorders by assessing many genes simultaneously using ngs can reduce costs compared to traditional methods of disease diagnosis which are often expensive and inconclusive while requiring extensive testing 

cancer is a disease of the genome and the goal of cancer genomics is to identify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one understanding these genomic changes will improve diagnostic accuracy increase understanding of the prognosis and enable oncologists to target therapies to individuals customers in the translational and clinical oncology markets use our products to perform research that may help identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to cancer customers also utilize our technology to identify the molecular changes in a tumor so that physicians can tailor treatment based on the genetic variation we believe that circulating tumor dna ctdna will become an important clinical tool for managing oncology patients during all stages of tumor progression our technology is being used to research the implications of ctdna in treatment determination treatment monitoring minimal residual disease and asymptomatic

sequencing 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases a c g or t in a dna sample our portfolio of sequencing platforms represents a family of systems that we believe set the standard for productivity costeffectiveness and accuracy among ngs technologies customers use our platforms to perform wholegenome de novo exome and rna sequencing and targeted resequencing of specific gene regions and genes 

wholegenome sequencing determines the complete dna sequence of an organism in de novo sequencing the goal is to sequence and analyze a sample without using information from prior sequencing of that species in targeted resequencing a portion of the sequence of an organism is compared to a standard or reference sequence from previously sequenced samples to identify genetic variation understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between and within species helps us understand the function of the structures encoded in the dna 

our dna sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminatorbased sequencing chemistry referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry sbs tracks the addition of labeled nucleotides as the dna chain is copied in a massively parallel fashion our sbs sequencing technology provides researchers with a broad range of applications and the ability to sequence even large mammalian genomes in a few days rather than weeks or years 

our sequencing platforms can generate between 500 megabases mb and 60 terabases tb equivalent to approximately 48 human genomes of genomic data in a single run depending on the instrument and application there are different price 

 6 

points per gigabase gb for each instrument and for different applications which range from smallgenome amplicon and targeted genepanel sequencing to populationscale whole human genome sequencing since we launched our first sequencing system in 2007 our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a factor of 10000 in addition the sequencing time per gb has dropped by a factor of approximately 12000 

our basespace informatics suite cloud platform plays a critical role in supporting our sequencing applications basespace suite integrates directly with our sequencing instruments allowing customers to manage their biological sample and sequencing runs process and analyze the raw genomic data and derive meaningful results it facilitates data sharing provides datastorage solutions and streamlines analysis through a growing number of applications developed by us and the bioinformatics community 

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2017  january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  sequencing revenue comprised 83    84  and   86  respectively of total revenues 

arrays 

arrays are used for a broad range of dna and rna analysis applications including snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression analysis and methylation analysis and enable the detection of millions of known genetic markers on a single array 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously this facilitates largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique highthroughput costeffective and flexible manner using our beadarray technology we achieve highthroughput analysis via a high density of test sites per array and the ability to format arrays in various configurations to serve the needs of multiple markets and market segments we can vary the size shape and format of the substrate into which the beads selfassemble and create specific bead types for different applications our iscan system and our nextseq 550 system can be used to image arrays 

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2017  january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  array revenue comprised 17  16  and 14  respectively of total revenues 

consumables 

we have developed various library preparation and sequencing kits to simplify workflows and accelerate analysis our sequencing applications include wholegenome sequencing kits which sequence entire genomes of any size and complexity and targeted resequencing kits which can sequence exomes specific genes rna or other genomic regions of interest our sequencing kits maximize the ability of our customers to characterize the target genome accurately and are sold in various configurations addressing a wide range of applications 

customers use illumina arraybased genotyping consumables for a wide range of analyses including diverse species diseaserelated mutations and genetic characteristics associated with cancer customers can select from a range of human animal and agriculturally relevant genome panels or create their own custom arrays to investigate millions of genetic markers targeting any species 

our services 

we provide wholegenome sequencing genotyping nipt and product support services human wholegenome sequencing services are provided through our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory using our services customers can perform wholegenome sequencing projects and microarray projects including largescale genotyping studies and wholegenome association studies we also provide nipt services through our partner laboratories that direct samples to us on a test sendout basis in our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory in addition we also offer support services to customers who have purchased our products 

intellectual property 

we have an extensive intellectual property portfolio as of february 1 2018 we own or have exclusive licenses to 719 issued us patents and 473 pending us patent applications including 32 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents our issued and pending patents cover various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments digital microfluidics software bioinformatics and chemicaldetection technologies and have terms that expire 

 7 

between 2018 and 2038 we continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies we have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries 

we protect trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks our success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and processes preserving trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks operating without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and acquiring licenses for technology or products in addition we invest in technological innovation and we seek beneficial licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our sequencing and array technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2018 and 2032 we have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties 

research and development 

illumina has historically made substantial investments in research and development our research and development efforts prioritize continuous innovation coupled with product evolution 

research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended december 31 2017  january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  were 546 million  504 million  and 401 million  respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2018  to support business growth and continuing expansion in research and productdevelopment efforts 

marketing and distribution 

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe latin america and the asiapacific region in each of these areas dedicated sales service and applicationsupport personnel are expanding and supporting their respective customer bases in addition we sell through lifescience distributors in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region latin america the middle east and south africa we expect to continue increasing our sales and distribution resources during 2018  and beyond as we launch new products and expand our potential customer base 

manufacturing 

we manufacture sequencing and array platforms and reagent kits in 2017 we continued to increase our manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand to address increasing product complexity and volume we continue to automate manufacturing processes to accelerate throughput and improve quality and yield we are committed to providing medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances our key manufacturing and distribution facilities operate under a quality management system certified to iso 13485 

raw materials 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies multiple commercial sources provide many of our components and supplies but there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from singlesource suppliers to manage potential risks arising from singlesource suppliers we believe that we could redesign our products using alternative components or for use with alternative reagents if necessary in addition while we attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 

  

competition 

although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect continued intense competition our competitors offer products and services for sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets they include companies such as agilent technologies inc bgi oxford nanopore technologies limited pacific biosciences of california inc qiagen nv roche 

 8 

holding ag and thermo fisher scientific inc among others some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources than we do along with larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase to compete effectively we must scale our organization and infrastructure appropriately and demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy 

segment and geographic information 

we have two reportable segments illumina’s core operations core illumina and one segment related to the combined activities of the consolidated vies grail and helix consolidated vies following the grail deconsolidation on february 28 2017 the consolidated vies no longer include grail prior to 2016 the combined results of operations of the consolidated vies were not material 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 12 billion  or 45  of total revenues during fiscal 2017  compared to 11 billion  or 46  and 10 billion  or 46  in fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively the us dollar has been determined to be the functional currency of our international operations due to the primary activities of our foreign subsidiaries we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note “11 segment information geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this report for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations

our backlog was approximately 935 million  and 650 million  as of december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  respectively generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom we expect approximately twothirds of our backlog as of december 31 2017  to be shipped within the fiscal year ending december 30 2018  although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer some customer agreements or applicable accounting treatments might require us to defer the recognition of revenue beyond title transfer 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to various federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe that we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

government regulation 

as we expand product lines to address the diagnosis of disease regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will become an increasingly significant factor in development testing production and marketing products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices or in vitro diagnostic products ivds by the fda and comparable agencies in other countries in the united states certain of our products may require fda clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda before marketing the usually shorter 510k clearance process which we used for the fdacleared assays that are run on our fdaregulated miseqdx instrument generally takes from three to six months after submission but it can take significantly longer the longer pma process is much more costly and uncertain it generally takes from 9 to 18 months after a complete filing but it can take significantly longer and requires conducting clinical studies that are generally more extensive than those required for 510k clearance all of the products that are currently regulated by the fda as medical devices and ivds are also subject to the fda quality system regulation qsr obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals including the fda quality system inspections that are required for pma approval can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

we cannot be certain which of our planned molecular diagnostic products will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process and in fact some of our products will need to go through the pma process the regulatory approval process for such 

 9 

products may be significantly delayed may be significantly more expensive than anticipated and may conclude without such products being approved by the fda without timely regulatory approval we will not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products this may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory clearance or approval of our products in addition the fda may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for us or our customers or both 

if our products labeled as “for research use only not for use in diagnostic procedures” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could be uncertain this is true even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

illumina products sold as medical devices or ivds in europe will be regulated under the in vitro diagnostics directive 9879ec a new regulation the in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation eu 2017746 the ivdr has been released and will become fully enforceable in 2020 these regulations include requirements for both presentation and review of performance data and qualitysystem requirements 

certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion not to regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however the fda is reexamining this regulatory approach and changes to the agency’s handling of ldts could impact our business in ways that cannot be predicted at this time in october 2014 the fda published two draft guidance documents suggesting an approach for registration and listing of laboratories and assays along with a framework for regulation of ldts by the fda based on risk to patients rather than whether the ldts were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory the draft framework guidance includes premarket review for higherrisk ldts including many used to guide treatment decisions as well as companion diagnostics that have entered the market as ldts we cannot predict the nature or extent of the fdas final guidance or regulation of ldts in general or with respect to our or our customers’ ldts in particular 

certification of clia laboratories includes standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management and quality control procedures clia also mandates that for high complexity labs such as ours to operate as a lab we must have an accreditation by an organization recognized by clia such as the college of pathologists cap which we have obtained and must maintain if we were to lose our clia certification or cap accreditation our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in addition state laboratory licensing and inspection requirements may also apply to our products which in some cases are more stringent than clia requirements 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had more than 6200  employees we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this report the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new   products 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on developing and commercializing new products and services including improving our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the 

 10 

markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products there can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

 we may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace 

  

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

our products are designed for use in the life sciences diagnostic agricultural pharmaceutical and consumer genomics industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in clinical research and consumer applications we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation or biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are relatively new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach what we expect to be their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into valuable information in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect 

if we do not successfully manage the development manufacturing and launch of new products or   services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely   affected 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions transition requirements or programs with respect to newlylaunched products or products in development which could adversely affect sales of our existing products for instance in 2017 we announced and launched our novaseq 6000 instrument system which was developed using our new sequencing architecture and in 2018 we launched our iseq 100 instrument system which combines cmos sensor technology with our proprietary sequencing technology if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle we may delay the product launch date the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or a lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 11 

as we announce future products or integrate new products into our portfolio such as new instruments or instrument platforms we face numerous risks relating to product transitions and the evolution of our product portfolio we may be unable to accurately forecast new product demand and the impact of new products on the demand for current or established products we may experience challenges relating to managing excess and obsolete inventories managing new or higher product cost structures and managing different sales and support requirements announcements of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing our current or established products until new products become available in addition customers may defer or stop purchasing our current or established products as they assess the features and technological characteristics of new products as compared to our current or established products before making a financial commitment if customers elect to purchase newlyintroduced products rather than established products revenue recognition on such purchases may be delayed because the availability of newlyintroduced products is generally constrained compared to established products as we scaleup manufacturing sales and support requirements for newlyintroduced products our failure to effectively manage the evolution of our product portfolio including product transitions or introductions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a wide range of competing technologies we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render one or more of our technologies obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines more focused product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences clinical genomics and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise for example the market for noninvasive prenatal testing is rapidly developing and if our competitors are able to develop and commercialize products superior to or less expensive than ours our business could be adversely impacted established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests potentially creating a competitive advantage for them 

we and our competitors also compete on the basis of price as the cost of analyzing genetic variation and biological function falls over time as we expect we cannot be sure that the demand for related products and services will increase proportionately in the future if the demand for our products and services proves to be more insensitive to lower sequencing costs than we expect our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for some of our products or subassemblies components and materials   used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are   delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the products components or materials supplied do   not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our   products in a timely manner or at all 

the complex nature of our products requires customized precisionmanufactured subassemblies components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some subassemblies components and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these subassemblies components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or at satisfactory qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products in whole or in part or develop these capabilities internally and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms in addition the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier the time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs diversion of resources 

 12 

or reduced manufacturing yields any of which would negatively impact our operating results accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the products subassemblies components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the democratic republic of the congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production or increase our costs any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

if defects are discovered in our products we may incur additional unforeseen costs our products may be subject to recalls customers may not purchase our products our reputation may suffer and ultimately our   sales and operating earnings could be negatively   impacted 

our products incorporate complex precisionmanufactured mechanical parts electrical components optical components and fluidics as well as computer software any of which may contain errors or failures especially when first introduced in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products in addition new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that despite testing are discovered only after commercial shipment defects or errors in our products may discourage customers from purchasing our products the costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating margins identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and thirdparty components may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur because our products are designed to be used to perform complex genomic analysis we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects if we do not meet applicable regulatory or quality standards our products may be subject to recall and under certain circumstances we may be required to notify applicable regulatory authorities about a recall if our products are subject to recall or shipment holds our reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

as we develop market or sell diagnostic tests we may encounter delays in receipt or limits in the amount of reimbursement approvals and public health funding which will impact our ability to grow revenues in the healthcare market 

physicians and patients may not order diagnostic tests that we develop market sell or enable such as our prenatal tests unless thirdparty payors such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid and governmental payors outside of the united states pay a substantial portion of the test price thirdparty payors are often reluctant to reimburse healthcare providers for the use of medical tests that involve new technologies or provide novel diagnostic information in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly limiting reimbursement coverage for medical diagnostic products and in many instances are exerting pressure on diagnostic product suppliers to reduce their prices reimbursement by a payor may depend on a number of factors including a payors determination that tests using our technologies are 

 since each thirdparty payor often makes reimbursement decisions on an individual patient basis obtaining such approvals is a timeconsuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical data supporting the clinical benefits of each of our products as a result there can be no assurance that reimbursement approvals will be obtained this process can delay the broad market introduction of new products and could have a negative effect on our results of operations as a result thirdparty reimbursement may not be consistent or financially adequate to cover the cost of diagnostic products that we develop market or sell this could limit our ability to sell our products or cause us to reduce prices which would adversely affect our results of operations 

 13 

even if our tests are being reimbursed thirdparty payors may withdraw their coverage policies cancel their contracts with our customers at any time review and adjust the rate of reimbursement require copayments from patients or stop paying for our tests which would reduce our revenues in addition insurers including managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid have increased their efforts to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services these measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization for the clinical laboratory industry reductions in the reimbursement rate of payors may occur in the future reductions in the prices at which our tests are reimbursed could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

litigation other proceedings or thirdparty claims of intellectual property   infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent   us from selling our products or services 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets or introduce new products we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual impact of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products or services and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products or services in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins and earnings per share in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue 

the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable other programs such as defense entitlement programs or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities such as the us national institute of health or nih past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced nih and other research and development allocations any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we   may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or   technologies 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 



 14 

 in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing or service capacity and develop and maintain   operation of our manufacturing or service capability we may not be able to launch or support   our products or services in a timely manner or at all 

we continue to increase our manufacturing and service capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing and service capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing and service capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments consumables and products that contain dna and enzymes we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically or prevent us from achieving expected performance levels any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

an interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials due to a catastrophic disaster or infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and the san francisco bay area in california madison wisconsin and singapore these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products in addition if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 

many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and 

 15 

storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis could be adversely impacted and we could be prevented from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional   personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

our future success depends upon the continuing services of members of our senior management team and scientific and engineering personnel the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing software engineering sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science and technology companies universities and research institutions competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco areas is intense and the turnover rate can be high moreover changes in immigration policies laws and regulations in the united states or other jurisdictions may make it more difficult for us to hire and retain members of management and scientific and engineering personnel failure to attract and retain management and scientific and engineering personnel could prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use sharebased compensation including restricted stock units and performance stock units to attract key personnel incentivize them to remain with us and align their interests with ours by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our   competitive position 

the proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences genomics forensics agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our proprietary position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against thirdparty claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies in that regard certain patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information 

our strategic investments and joint ventures may result in losses 

we periodically make strategic investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business in addition we periodically form companies such as helix that remain consolidated within our financial statements but receive substantial funding from thirdparty investors who are granted certain control and 

 16 

governance rights the market values of these strategic investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control otherthantemporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses related to our investment this could result in future charges to our earnings it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any longterm benefits associated with these strategic investments 

security breaches including with respect to cybersecurity and other disruptions could compromise our information products and services and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions as a leader in the field of genetic analysis we may face cyberattacks that attempt to penetrate our network security including our data centers sabotage or otherwise disable our research products and services including instruments at our customers’ sites misappropriate our or our customers and partners proprietary information which may include personally identifiable information or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and damage to our reputation 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government   regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may   be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

our products are not subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis treatment or prevention of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as our fdaregulated miseqdx certain of our products will become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable international agencies including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

molecular diagnostic products are regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable international agencies and may require either clearance from the fda following the 510k premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition if our products labeled as “for research use only not for use in diagnostic procedures” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could change or be uncertain even if such use by our customers is without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

if the fda requires in the future that any of our ldt products be subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion not to regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however the fda has been reconsidering its enforcement discretion policy and has commented that regulation of ldts may be warranted because of the growth in the volume and complexity of testing services utilizing ldts in october 2014 the fda published two draft guidance documents suggesting an approach for registration and listing of laboratories and assays along with a framework for regulation of ldts by the fda based on risk to patients rather than whether the ldts were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory the draft framework 

 17 

guidance includes premarket review for higherrisk ldts including many used to guide treatment decisions as well as companion diagnostics that have entered the market as ldts we cannot predict the nature or extent of the fdas final guidance or regulation of ldts in general or with respect to our ldts in particular if the fda requires in the future that ldt products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

if product or service liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us we may face reduced demand for our products and incur significant liabilities 

our products and services are used for sensitive applications and we face an inherent risk of exposure to product or service liability claims if our products or services are alleged to have caused harm resulted in false negatives or false positives or do not perform in accordance with specifications product liability claims filed against us or against third parties to whom we may have an obligation could be costly and timeconsuming to defend and result in substantial damages or reputational risk we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully defend any product or service liability lawsuit brought against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome product or service liability claims may result in 

 although we carry product and service liability insurance if we become the subject of a successful product or service liability lawsuit our insurance may not cover all substantial liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our   business 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe the asiapacific region and brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in singapore shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 45  46  and 46  of our total revenue for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

during 2017 a significant portion of our international sales were denominated in foreign currencies while the majority of our purchases of raw materials were denominated in us dollars changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations recent global financial conditions have led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to the foregoing risks international operations entail the following risks

 additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax policies laws regulations or rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation location of operations changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the us internal revenue service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken on our tax returns we could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if material payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be   able to sustain operating profitability 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the timing and availability of our customers’ funding the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final weeks of the quarter in light of that our revenue cutoff and recognition procedures together with our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter 

a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel to meet the anticipated growth in our business we may incur fixed expenses such as costs related to facility expansions before we generate revenue sufficient to fully support such expenses in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash sharebased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

 19 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect periodtoperiod changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

we may not be able to convert our order backlog into revenue 

our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products we may not receive revenue from some of these orders and the order backlog we report may not be indicative of our future revenue many events can cause an order to be delayed or not completed at all some of which may be out of our control if we delay fulfilling customer orders or if customers reconsider their orders those customers may seek to cancel or modify their orders with us customers may otherwise seek to cancel or delay their orders even if we are prepared to fulfill them if our orders in backlog do not result in sales our operating results may suffer 

disruption of critical information technology systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could have an adverse effect on our operations business customer relations and financial condition 

information technology it systems help us operate efficiently interface with customers maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including product manufacturing and supply chain sales forecast order fulfillment and billing customer service logistics and management of financial reports and data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures power loss natural disasters human acts terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences disruption of our operations which could harm our reputation and financial results 

if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper it infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach if our data management systems do not effectively collect store process and report relevant data for the operation of our business whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints software deficiencies or human error our ability to effectively plan forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired any such impairment could adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results 

as we continuously adjust our workflow and business practices and add additional functionality to our enterprise resource planning software and other software applications problems could arise that we have not foreseen including interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments   by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our   financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments in particular accounting rules related to companies that we form together with or that receive substantial funding from thirdparty investors such as helix are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

 20 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could   reduce demand for our products or services 

our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops other food sources and other living organisms the information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information including preimplantation genetic screening of embryos prenatal genetic testing genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions particularly for those that have no known cure governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses 

as of december 31 2017  we had 633 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2019 and 517 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2021 outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 29  with respect to convertible notes due 2019 and 35  with respect to convertible notes due 2021 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include antitakeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us our certificate of incorporation has provisions that give our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 

in addition certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law dgcl including section 203 of the dgcl may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina section 203 of the dgcl provides with certain exceptions for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15 and less than 85 of the voting stock exclusive of stock held by directors officers and employee plans of a company 

the above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock

business overview and outlook 

we have two reportable segments illumina’s core operations core illumina and one segment related to the combined activities of our consolidated vies grail and helix consolidated vies following the grail deconsolidation on february 28 2017 our consolidated vies no longer include grail for information on grail and helix refer to note “11 segment information geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this report 

we are the global leader in sequencing and arraybased technologies for genetic analysis serving customers in a wide range of markets enabling the adoption of genomic solutions in research and clinical settings 

our customers include leading genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and hospitals as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology commercial molecular diagnostic laboratories and consumer genomics companies 

our portfolio of integrated systems consumables and analysis tools is designed to accelerate and simplify genetic analysis this portfolio addresses the range of genomic complexity price points and throughput enabling customers to select the best solution for their research or clinical challenge 

consolidated financial highlights include the following 

  

 

 

 



 26 

our effective tax rate was 350  and 237  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily impacted by the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation such impacts were offset primarily by the provisional estimated impact of us tax reform of 150 million 

our future effective tax rate may vary from the us federal statutory tax rate due to the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor “we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions” in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this report we may also be adversely impacted in the future if the tax court opinion regarding the exclusion of stock compensation from costsharing charges is overturned based on our initial interpretation and analysis of us tax reform and projected future financial results we anticipate that our effective tax rate will trend lower than the us federal statutory tax rate in the future due to the portion of our earnings that will be subject to lower statutory tax rates as further information is gathered and interpretation and analysis of the tax legislation evolves we will update our estimate of the future effective tax rate 

 

this overview and outlook provides a highlevel discussion of our operating results and significant known trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important to understanding our financial results for the periods reported herein as well as our future financial performance this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this report

revenue 



product revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of consumables and instruments service and other revenue consists primarily of sequencing and genotyping service revenue as well as instrument service contract revenue total revenue primarily relates to core illumina for all periods presented 

 28 

2017  compared to 2016 

revenue increased   354 million  or 15  to 2752 million  in 2017  compared to 2398 million  in 2016  

consumables revenue increased   210 million  or 14  to 1753 million  in 2017  compared to 1543 million  in 2016  driven by growth in the sequencing instrument installed base 

instrument revenue increased   46 million  or 10  to 515 million  in 2017  compared to 469 million  in 2016  primarily due to shipments of our novaseq instrument introduced in q1 2017 partially offset by lower shipments of our hiseq and hiseq x instruments 

service and other revenue increased   97 million  or 27  to 463 million  in 2017  compared to 366 million  in 2016  driven by revenue from genotyping services and extended instrument service contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base 

2016  compared to 2015 

revenue increased   178 million  or 8  to 2398 million  in 2016  compared to 2220 million  in 2015  

consumables revenue increased   264 million  or 21  to 1543 million  in 2016  compared to 1279 million  in the prior year driven by growth in the sequencing instrument installed base 

instrument revenue decreased   126 million  or 21  to 469 million  in 2016  compared to 595 million  in the prior year primarily due to lower shipments of our highthroughput platforms 

  

service and other revenue increased   37 million  or 11  to 366 million  in 2016  compared to 329 million  in the prior year driven by revenue from genotyping services and instrument service contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base partially offset by our nipt customers shifting to inhouse testing on our sequencers 

gross margin 



2017  compared to 2016 

gross margin decreased  to 664  in 2017  compared to 695  in 2016 the gross margin decrease was driven by a variety of factors including an 18 million impairment of an acquired intangible asset an increase in lowermargin array services mix inventory reserves related to product transitions and lower instrument margin from the novaseq introduction 

2016  compared to 2015 

gross margin decreased  to 695  compared to 698  in the prior year gross margin decreased  primarily due to our   increased manufacturing capacity which was partially offset by a greater mix of sequencing consumables 

operating expense 



 29 

2017  compared to 2016 

research and development rd expense increased  by 42 million  or 8  in 2017  from 2016  core illumina rd expense increased by 58 million  or 13  primarily due to increased headcount as we continue to invest in the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products rd expense of our consolidated vies decreased by 16 million  primarily due to the deconsolidation of grail in q1 2017 partially offset by growth in helix’s operations 

selling general and administrative sga expense increased  by 90 million  or 15  in 2017  from 2016  core illumina sga expense increased by 73 million  or 13  primarily due to increased headcount and facilities investment to support the continued growth and scale of our operations sga expense of our consolidated vies increased by 17 million  due to marketing expenses related to helix’s july 2017 platform launch and increased headcount as well as performancebased compensation related to the grail series b financing these results were partially offset by the deconsolidation of grail in q1 2017 

legal contingencies in 2016 represent a reversal of previously recorded expense related to the settlement of patent litigation 

2016  compared to 2015 

research and development expense increased by 103 million  or 26  in 2016  from 2015  core illumina rd expense increased by 60 million or 15 primarily due to increased headcount and outside services as we continue to invest in the development of new products as well as enhancements to existing products our consolidated vies contributed 43 million to the increase primarily due to 34 million incurred by grail 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased by 68 million  or 13  in 2016  from 2015  core illumina sga expense increased 45 million or 9 primarily due to headcount and facilities investment to support the continued growth and scale of our operations as well as outside services grail and helix contributed 14 million and 9 million to the increase respectively 

legal contingencies in 2016  represent a reversal of prior year expense related to the settlement of patent litigation 

other income expense net 



other income expense net primarily relates to core illumina for all periods presented 

2017  compared to 2016 

interest income increased in 2017  compared to 2016  as a result of higher yields on our investments and higher savings and money market balances interest expense consisted primarily of accretion of discount on our convertible senior notes 

  

other income expense net increased in 2017  compared to 2016 primarily due to a 453 million gain recorded on the deconsolidation of grail in q1 2017 and an increase in net foreign exchange gains 

 30 

2016  compared to 2015 

interest income increased in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of higher yields on our investments and higher savings and money market balances interest expense consisted primarily of accretion of discount on our convertible senior notes the decrease in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to a lower outstanding principal balance on the 2016 notes which matured in march 2016 

  

costmethod investment gain net in 2015 consisted primarily of gains on dispositions of costmethod investments partially offset by impairment charges on other investments 

other expense net in 2015 consisted primarily of 4 million in net foreign exchange losses and 4 million in loss on extinguishment of debt 

provision for income taxes 



2017  compared to 2016 

our effective tax rate was 350  and 237  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily impacted by the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation such impacts were offset primarily by the provisional estimated impact of us tax reform of 150 million the impact of us tax reform primarily represents our provisional estimates of the onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the impact of revaluing our us deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the statutory rates at which they are expected to be recognized in the future which for federal purposes was reduced from 35 to 21 in 2016 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory rates from the us federal statutory rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom partially offset by the tax impact associated with the investment in our consolidated variable interest entities 

2016  compared to 2015 

our effective tax rate was 237 and 216 in 2016 and 2015 respectively in 2016 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory rates from the us federal statutory rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom partially offset by the tax impact associated with the investment in our consolidated variable interest entities in 2015 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable to a discrete tax benefit of 25 million related to the exclusion of stock compensation from prior period costsharing charges as a result of a tax court opinion in which an unrelated third party was successful in challenging such charges the decrease from the us federal statutory tax rate also resulted from the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2017  we had approximately 12 billion  in cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 826 million  was held by our foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents held by our consolidated vies as of december 31 2017  were 18 million  cash and cash equivalents decreased by 490 million  from last year due to the factors described in the “cash flow summary” below our primary source of liquidity other than our holdings of cash cash equivalents and investments has been cash flows from operations our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest the historical earnings of our foreign subsidiaries generated prior to 2017 for the year ended december 31 2017 we asserted that 869 million  of foreign earnings generated in 2017 would not be indefinitely invested 

 31 

historically we have liquidated our shortterm investments andor issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities as of december 31 2017  we had 920 million  in shortterm investments shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017  were approximately 305 million  our shortterm investments include marketable securities consisting of us governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities 

we anticipate that our current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash provided by operating activities are sufficient to fund our nearterm capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include 

   

our convertible senior notes due 2019 and 2021 were not convertible as of december 31 2017 

 on may 4 2017 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase 250 million of outstanding common stock the repurchases may be completed under a 10b51 plan or at management’s discretion authorizations to repurchase 100 million  of our common stock remained available as of december 31 2017  

certain noncontrolling helix investors may require illumina to redeem all noncontrolling interests in cash at the then approximate fair market value such redemption right is exercisable at the option of certain noncontrolling interest holders after january 1 2021 provided that a bona fide pursuit of the sale of helix has occurred and an initial public offering of helix has not been completed the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests related to helix as of december 31 2017  was 220 million  

we have 83 million  remaining in our capital commitment to a venture capital investment fund as of december 31 2017  

we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1 organization and significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing services and instrument service contracts the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgment and estimates 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met we occasionally offer discounts on newly introduced products to recent customers of existing products where applicable we defer a portion of revenue on the sales of existing products in recognition of the promotional discounts until the delivery of new products all revenue is recorded net of discounts and sales taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities 

revenue from product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered typically evenly over the contract term revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreedupon milestones are reached 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether an arrangement is cancellable or subject to future changes in price deliverables or other terms if it is determined that the price is not fixed or determinable we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 

we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including products or services these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame approximately three to six months after the contract execution date revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a standalone basis 

 35 

for transactions with multiple deliverables consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence exists we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 

in order to establish vsoe of selling price we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined then we consider whether thirdparty evidence can be used to establish selling price due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry we have rarely established selling price using thirdparty evidence if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence of selling price exists we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

in certain markets we sell products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products in most sales through distributors the product is delivered directly to customers in cases where the product is delivered to a distributor revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor andor the enduser if required by the applicable sales contract the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers these transactions are accounted for in accordance with our revenue recognition policy described herein 

investments 

we invest in various types of securities including debt securities in governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities as of december 31 2017  we had 920 million  in shortterm investments in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we classify our investments as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 

as discussed in note “4 fair value measurements” in part ii item 8 of this report a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level 2 these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a thirdparty service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly such as yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings and in the process we apply judgment and estimates that if changed could significantly affect our statement of financial positions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

 36 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycles quality issues historical experience and usage forecasts our gross inventory totaled 375 million  and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was 42 million  at december 31 2017  historically our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses however if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assess on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors which include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates resulting in a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the fair values assigned defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets net of liabilities assumed as goodwill these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

in connection with certain of our acquisitions additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones in these cases a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable inputs such as anticipated future cash flows riskfree adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisitionrelated gain expense net a component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income this method requires significant management judgment including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 

management typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our longlived assets are impaired a review of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment if indicators of impairment exist we assess the recoverability of the affected longlived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts 

 37 

in order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows the time value of money and other factors that a willing market participant would consider significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our reporting unit we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

sharebased compensation 

we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

the determination of fair value of sharebased awards requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected life of an award expected dividends the riskfree interest rate and forecast of our future financial performance in the case of performance stock units we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards we update our forecast of future financial performance periodically which impacts our estimate of the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the outstanding performance stock units we amortize the fair value of sharebased compensation on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards if any of the assumptions used change significantly sharebased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

warranties 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on instruments additionally we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve and adjust if necessary the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of our future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

in accordance with the tax cuts and jobs act that was enacted on december 22 2017 us tax reform we have recorded a provision for income taxes of 150 million the impact of us tax reform primarily represents our provisional estimates of the onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the 

 38 

impact of revaluing our us deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future for us federal purposes the corporate statutory income tax rate was reduced from 35 to 21 effective for our 2018 tax year the provisional impact of us tax reform is our current best estimate based on a preliminary review of the new law and is subject to revision based on our existing accounting for income taxes policy as further information is gathered and interpretation and analysis of the tax legislation evolves the securities and exchange commission has issued rules allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of us tax reform to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts any future changes to our provisional estimated impact of us tax reform will be included as an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined

interest rate sensitivity 

our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates the fair market value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investmentgrade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interestsensitive financial instruments 

changes in interest rates may impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes in june 2014 we issued 633 million  aggregate principal amount of 0  convertible senior notes due 2019 2019 notes and 517 million  aggregate principal amount of 05  convertible senior notes due 2021 2021 notes at our election the notes are convertible into cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price at 130 above the conversion price the notes will become convertible upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our thencurrent incremental borrowing rate if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted the implicit interest rates for the 2019 and 2021 notes were 29  and 35  respectively an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of 100 million aggregate principal amount of each of the 2019 and 2021 notes would result in losses of approximately 2 million  and 3 million  respectively

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than our us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro yen australian dollar and canadian dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income 

we use forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the gains or losses from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities as of december 31 2017  the total notional amount of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was 88 million

genetics primer 

the instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna the complete set of dna for any organism is referred to as its genome dna contains small regions called genes which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively these nucleotide bases occur in a precise order known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a partial copy of its dna sequence called messenger rna mrna is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function the illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic 

variations among organisms are due in large part to differences in their dna sequences changes can result from insertions deletions inversions translocations or duplications of nucleotide bases these changes may result in certain genes becoming overexpressed excessive protein production underexpressed reduced protein production or silenced altogether sometimes triggering changes in cellular function these changes can be the result of heredity but most often they occur at random the most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide polymorphism snp which is a base change in a single position in a dna sequence another type of variation copy number variations cnvs occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes segments of a gene or stretches of dna 

in humans genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see eg height hair eye color etc genetic variations also can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease they can affect individual response to certain drug treatments causing patients to experience adverse side effects or to respond well or not at all 

scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans as well as in a broad range of animals plants and microorganisms such research takes place in government university pharmaceutical biotechnology and agrigenomics laboratories around the world where scientists expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life beginning at the genetic level illumina tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes lifescience research includes the study of the cells tissues organs systems and other components of living organisms this research supports the development of new treatments to improve human health examples include more tailored clinical treatments often referred to as precision medicine as well as advances in agriculture and animal husbandry to meet growing needs for food and energy researchers who investigate human viral and bacterial genetic variation to understand the mechanisms of disease are enabling the development of more effective diagnostics and therapeutics they also provide greater insight into genetic variation in plants eg food and biofuel crops and animals eg livestock and domestic enabling improvements in crop yields and animal breeding programs 

by empowering genetic analysis and facilitating a deeper understanding of genetic variation and function our tools advance disease research drug development and the creation of molecular diagnostic tests we believe that this will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and health care and that the increased emphasis on preventive and predictive molecular medicine will usher in the era of precision health care 

our principal markets 

our organization is structured to target the markets and customers outlined below 

 5 

life sciences 

historically our core business has been in the life sciences research market this includes laboratories associated with universities research centers and government institutions along with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions use our products and services for basic and translational research across a spectrum of scientific applications including targeted exome and wholegenome sequencing genetic variation gene expression epigenetics and metagenomics nextgeneration sequencing ngs technologies are being adopted due to their declining costs per sample as well as their ability to sequence large sample sizes and generate vast amounts of data both private and public funding drive this research along with global initiatives to characterize genetic variation 

we also serve applied markets including consumer genomics agrigenomics forensic genomics and transplant biology in consumer genomics our customers use our technologies to provide personalized genetic data and analysis to individual consumers in agrigenomics government and corporate researchers use our products and services to explore the genetic and biological basis for productivity and nutritional constitution in crops and livestock researchers can identify natural and novel genomic variation and deploy genomewide markerbased applications to accelerate breeding and production of healthier and higheryielding crops and livestock in forensic genomics major law enforcement agencies use genomic information to investigate criminal cases as do military and security intelligence agencies in transplant diagnostics we offer a sampletoanswer solution to perform high resolution hla typing in a single assay which enables users to determine how closely the tissues of one person match the tissues of another person 

clinical genomics 

we provide sampletoanswer solutions to our customers in two key areas of translational and clinical genomics reproductive and genetic health and oncology 

illumina provides reproductivehealth solutions including noninvasive prenatal testing nipt preimplantation genetic screening and diagnosis pgs and pgd and neonatal and genetic health testing our technology enables nipt for early identification of fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing cellfree dna in maternal blood our pgs solution is used with in vitro fertilization ivf to determine before implantation whether an embryo has an abnormal number of chromosomes which is a major cause of ivf failure and miscarriages in the case of pgd the technology determines which embryos are free from gene variants associated with genetic diseases 

cancer is a disease of the genome and the goal of cancer genomics is to identify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one understanding these genomic changes improves diagnostic accuracy increases understanding of the prognosis and enables oncologists to target therapies to individuals customers in the translational and clinical oncology markets use our products to perform research that may help identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to cancer customers also utilize our technology to identify the molecular changes in a tumor so that physicians can tailor treatment based on the genetic variation we believe that circulating tumor dna ctdna will become an important clinical tool for managing oncology patients during all stages of tumor progression our technology is being used to research the implications of ctdna in treatment determination treatment monitoring minimal residual disease and asymptomatic screening for example we have invested in grail which was formed to develop a bloodbased test for earlystage cancer detection and has been enabled by our sequencing technology 

to advance genomicbased precision oncology care we are working with key opinion leaders to set standards for ngsbased assays in routine clinical oncology practice and to define regulatory frameworks for this new testing paradigm 

our principal products and technologies 

our unique technology platforms support the scale of experimentation necessary for populationscale studies genomewide discovery target selection and validation studies see figure 1 below customers use our products to analyze the genome at all levels of complexity from wholegenome sequencing to targeted panels a large and dynamic illumina user community has published tens of thousands of customerauthored scientific papers using our technologies through rapid innovation we are changing the economics of genetic research enabling projects that were previously considered impossible and supporting clinical advances towards precision medicine

sequencing 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases a c g or t in a dna sample our portfolio of sequencing platforms represents a family of systems that we believe set the standard for productivity costeffectiveness and accuracy among ngs technologies customers use our platforms to perform wholegenome de novo exome and rna sequencing and targeted resequencing of specific gene regions and genes 

wholegenome sequencing determines the complete dna sequence of an organism in de novo sequencing the goal is to sequence and analyze a sample without using information from prior sequencing of that species in targeted resequencing a portion of the sequence of an organism is compared to a standard or reference sequence from previously sequenced samples to identify genetic variation understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between and within species helps us understand the function of the structures encoded in the dna 

our dna sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminatorbased sequencing chemistry referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry sbs tracks the addition of labeled nucleotides as the dna chain is copied in a massively parallel fashion our sbs sequencing technology provides researchers with a broad range of applications and the ability to sequence even large mammalian genomes in a few days rather than weeks or years 

our sequencing platforms can generate between 500 megabases mb and 20 terabases tb equivalent to 16 human genomes of genomic data in a single run depending on the instrument and application there are different price points per gigabase gb for each instrument and for different applications which range from smallgenome amplicon and targeted genepanel sequencing to populationscale whole human genome sequencing since we launched our first sequencing system in 2007 our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a factor of 10000 in addition the sequencing time per gb has dropped by a factor of approximately 3500 

our basespace informatics suite cloud platform plays a critical role in supporting our sequencing applications basespace suite integrates directly with our sequencing instruments allowing customers to manage their biological sample and sequencing runs process and analyze the raw genomic data and derive meaningful results it facilitates data sharing provides datastorage solutions and streamlines analysis through a growing number of applications from us and the bioinformatics community some components of the basespace informatics suite can also be installed for customers onsite 

for the fiscal years ended january 1 2017  january 3 2016  and december 28 2014  sequencing revenue comprised 84    86  and   81  respectively of total revenues

arrays 

arrays are used for a broad range of dna and rna analysis applications including snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression analysis and methylation analysis and allow for the detection of millions of known genetic markers on a single array 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously this facilitates largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a uniquely highthroughput costeffective and flexible manner using our beadarray technology we achieve highthroughput analysis via a high density of test sites per array and the ability to format arrays in various configurations varying the size shape and format of the substrate into which the beads selfassemble and creating specific bead types for different applications lets us address multiple markets and market segments both our iscan array scanner system and our nextseq 550 system can be used to image the arrays 

for the fiscal years ended january 1 2017  january 3 2016  and december 28 2014  array revenue comprised 16  14  and 19  respectively of total revenues 

consumables 

we have developed various library preparation and sequencing kits to simplify workflows and accelerate analysis our sequencing applications include wholegenome sequencing kits which sequence entire genomes of any size and complexity and targeted resequencing kits which can sequence exomes specific genes rna or other genomic regions of interest our sequencing kits maximize the ability of our customers to characterize the target genome accurately and are sold in various configurations which address a wide range of applications 

customers use illumina arraybased genotyping consumables for a wide range of analyses including diverse species diseaserelated mutations and genetic characteristics associated with cancer customers can select from a range of human animal and agriculturally relevant genome panels or create their own custom arrays to investigate millions of genetic markers targeting any species 

our services 

we provide wholegenome sequencing genotyping nipt and support services human wholegenome sequencing services are provided through our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory using our services customers can perform wholegenome sequencing projects and microarray projects including largescale genotyping studies and wholegenome association studies we also provide nipt services through our partner laboratories that direct samples to us on a test sendout basis in our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory in addition we also offer support services to customers who have purchased our products 

intellectual property 

we have an extensive intellectual property portfolio as of february 1 2017 we own or have exclusive licenses to 671 issued us patents and 572 pending us patent applications including 31 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents our issued and pending patents cover various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments digital microfluidics software bioinformatics and chemicaldetection technologies and have terms that expire between 2017 and 2038 we continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies we have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries 

we protect trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and processes preserving trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks operating without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and acquiring licenses for technology or products 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our sequencing and array technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2017 and 2032 we have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties

research and development 

illumina has historically made substantial investments in research and development our research and development efforts prioritize continuous innovation coupled with product evolution 

research and development expenses for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were 5044 million  4015 million  and 3881 million  respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during fiscal 2017  to support business growth and continuing expansion in research and productdevelopment efforts 

marketing and distribution 

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe latin america and the asiapacific region in each of these areas dedicated sales service and applicationsupport personnel are expanding and supporting their respective customer bases in addition we sell through lifescience distributors in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region latin america the middle east and south africa we expect to continue increasing our sales and distribution resources during 2017  and beyond as we launch new products and expand our potential customer base 

manufacturing 

we manufacture sequencing and array platforms and reagent kits in 2016 we continued to increase our manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand to address increasing product complexity and volume we continue to automate manufacturing processes to accelerate throughput and improve quality and yield we are committed to providing medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances our key manufacturing and distribution facilities operate under a quality management system certified to iso 13485 

raw materials 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies multiple commercial sources provide many of our components and supplies but there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from singlesource suppliers to manage potential risks arising from single source suppliers we believe that we could redesign our products using alternative components or for use with alternative reagents if necessary in addition while we attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 

  

competition 

although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect continued intense competition our competitors offer products and services for sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets they include companies such as agilent technologies inc bgi oxford nanopore technologies limited pacific biosciences of california inc qiagen nv roche holding ag and thermo fisher scientific inc among others some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources than we do along with larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase to compete effectively we must scale our organization and infrastructure appropriately and demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy 

segment and geographic information 

we are organized into three operating segments for purposes of evaluating our business operations and reviewing our financial results one segment consists of illumina’s core operations core illumina the other two segments relate to the activities of our consolidated variable interest entities vies grail and helix the combined results of operations of our consolidated vies became material during the year ended january 1 2017 as such we commenced reporting two segments core illumina and consolidated vies during 2016 

 9 

  

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 11042 million  or 46  of total revenues during fiscal 2016  compared to 10124 million  or 46  and 9107 million  or 49  in fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively the us dollar has been determined to be the functional currency of the company’s international operations due to the primary activities of our foreign subsidiaries we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note “12 segment information geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately 650 million  and 560 million  as of january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  respectively generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balancesheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom we expect approximately twothirds of our backlog as of january 1 2017  to be shipped within the fiscal year ending december 31 2017  although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer some customer agreements or applicable accounting treatments might require us to defer the recognition of revenue beyond title transfer 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to various federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe that we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

government regulation 

as we expand product lines to address the diagnosis of disease regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will become an increasingly significant factor in development testing production and marketing products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies in other countries in the united states certain of our products may require fda clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda before marketing the usually shorter 510k clearance process which we used for the fdacleared assays that are run on our fdaregulated miseqdx instrument generally takes from three to six months after submission but it can take significantly longer the longer pma process is much more costly and uncertain it generally takes from 9 to 18 months after a complete filing but it can take significantly longer and typically requires conducting clinical studies which are not always needed for a 510k clearance all of the products that are currently regulated by the fda as medical devices are also subject to the fda quality system regulation qsr obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals including the fda quality system inspections that are required for pma approval can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

we cannot be certain which of our planned molecular diagnostic products will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process and in fact some of our products may need to go through the pma process the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed may be significantly more expensive than anticipated and may conclude without such products being approved by the fda without timely regulatory approval we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products this may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory clearance or approval of our products in addition the fda may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for either or both illumina or our customers 

if our products labeled as “for research use only not for use in diagnostic procedures” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could 

 10 

be uncertain this is true even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

illumina products sold as medical devices in europe will be regulated under the in vitro diagnostics directive 9879ec this regulation includes requirements for both presentation and review of performance data and qualitysystem requirements 

certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion to not regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however the fda is reexamining this regulatory approach and changes to the agency’s handling of ldts could impact our business in ways that cannot be predicted at this time in october 2014 the fda published two draft guidance documents suggesting an approach for registration and listing of laboratories and assays along with a framework for regulation of ldts by the fda based on risk to patients rather than whether the ldts were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory the draft framework guidance includes premarket review for higherrisk ldts including many used to guide treatment decisions as well as companion diagnostics that have entered the market as ldts we cannot predict the nature or extent of the fdas final guidance or regulation of ldts in general or with respect to our or our customers’ ldts in particular 

certification of clia laboratories includes standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management and quality control procedures clia also mandates that for high complexity labs such as ours to operate as a lab we must have an accreditation by an organization recognized by clia such as the college of pathologists cap which we have obtained and must maintain if we were to lose our clia certification or cap accreditation our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in addition state laboratory licensing and inspection requirements may also apply to our products which in some cases are more stringent than clia requirements 

  

employees 

as of january 1 2017  we had more than 5500  employees we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

if we do not successfully manage the development manufacturing and launch of new products or   services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely   affected 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions or transition requirements or programs with respect to newly launched products or products in development which could adversely affect sales of our existing products for instance in january 2017 we announced our novaseq 5000 and 6000 instrument systems which were developed using our new sequencing architecture if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle we may delay the product launch date the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

when we introduce or announce new or enhanced products we face numerous risks relating to product transitions including the inability to accurately forecast demand including with respect to our existing products manage excess and obsolete inventories address new or higher product cost structures and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new or enhanced products announcements of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing our products until new products become available our failure to effectively manage product transitions or introductions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences diagnostic agricultural and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation or biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are relatively new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new   products 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on developing and commercializing new products and services including improving our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products there can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

 we may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace 

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for some of our products or subassemblies components and materials   used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are   delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the products components or materials supplied do   not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our   products in a timely manner or at all 

 12 

the complex nature of our products requires customized precisionmanufactured subassemblies components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some subassemblies components and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these subassemblies components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products in whole or in part or develop these capabilities internally and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms in addition the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier the time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields any of which would negatively impact our operating results accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the products subassemblies components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the democratic republic of the congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production or increase our costs any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

if defects are discovered in our products we may incur additional unforeseen costs our products may be subject to recalls customers may not purchase our products our reputation may suffer and ultimately our   sales and operating earnings could be negatively   impacted 

our products incorporate complex precisionmanufactured mechanical parts electrical components optical components and fluidics as well as computer software any of which may contain errors or failures especially when first introduced in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products in addition new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that despite testing are discovered only after commercial shipment defects or errors in our products may discourage customers from purchasing our products the costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating margins identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and thirdparty components may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur because our products are designed to be used to perform complex genomic analysis we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects if we do not meet applicable regulatory or quality standards our products may be subject to recall and under certain circumstances we may be required to notify applicable regulatory authorities about a recall if our products are subject to recall or shipment holds our reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a wide range of competing technologies we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render one or more of our technologies obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences clinical genomics and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

 13 

the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 

as we develop market or sell diagnostic tests we may encounter delays in receipt or limits in the amount of reimbursement approvals and public health funding which will impact our ability to grow revenues in the healthcare market 

physicians and patients may not order diagnostic tests that we develop market or sell such as our verifi prenatal test unless thirdparty payors such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid and governmental payors outside of the united states pay a substantial portion of the test price thirdparty payors are often reluctant to reimburse healthcare providers for the use of medical tests that involve new technologies or provide novel diagnostic information in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly limiting reimbursement coverage for medical diagnostic products and in many instances are exerting pressure on diagnostic product suppliers to reduce their prices reimbursement by a payor may depend on a number of factors including a payors determination that tests using our technologies are 

 since each thirdparty payor often makes reimbursement decisions on an individual patient basis obtaining such approvals is a timeconsuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical data supporting the clinical benefits of each of our products as a result there can be no assurance that reimbursement approvals will be obtained this process can delay the broad market introduction of new products and could have a negative effect on our results of operations as a result thirdparty reimbursement may not be consistent or financially adequate to cover the cost of diagnostic products that we develop market or sell this could limit our ability to sell our products or cause us to reduce prices which would adversely affect our results of operations 

even if our tests are being reimbursed third party payors may withdraw their coverage policies cancel their contracts with our customers at any time review and adjust the rate of reimbursement require copayments from patients or stop paying for our tests which would reduce our revenues in addition insurers including managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid have increased their efforts to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services these measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization for the clinical laboratory industry reductions in the reimbursement rate of payors may occur in the future reductions in the prices at which our tests are reimbursed could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

litigation other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property   infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent   us from selling our products or services 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets or introduce new products we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual impact of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products or services and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain 

 14 

one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products or services in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins and earnings per share in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue 

the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe in particular focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting uncertain economic growth funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable other programs such as defense entitlement programs or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities such as the us national institute of health or nih past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced nih and other research and development allocations any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we   may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or   technologies 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing or service capacity and develop and maintain   operation of our manufacturing or service capability we may not be able to launch or support   our products or services in a timely manner or at all 

we continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing and service capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing and service capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing and service capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments consumables and products that contain dna and enzymes we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

an interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials due to a catastrophic disaster or infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and the san francisco bay area in california madison wisconsin and singapore these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products in addition if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 

many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional   personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

our future success depends upon the continuing services of members of our senior management team and scientific and engineering personnel the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing software engineering sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science and technology companies universities and research institutions competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco areas is intense 

 16 

and the turnover rate can be high moreover changes in immigration policies laws and regulations in the united states or other jurisdictions may make it more difficult for us to hire and retain members of management and scientific and engineering personnel failure to attract and retain management and scientific and engineering personnel could prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use sharebased compensation including restricted stock units and performance stock units to attract key personnel incentivize them to remain with us and align their interests with those of the company by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our   competitive position 

the proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences genomics forensics agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our proprietary position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies in that regard certain patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information 

our strategic investments and joint ventures may result in losses 

we periodically make strategic investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business in addition we periodically form companies such as grail and helix that remain consolidated within our financial statements but receive substantial funding from thirdparty investors who are granted certain control and governance rights the market values of these strategic investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control otherthantemporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses related to our investment this could result in future charges to our earnings it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any longterm benefits associated with these strategic investments 

in january 2017 we announced that grail has received indications of interest to invest approximately 1 billion for grail’s series b financing primarily from undisclosed private and strategic investors grail intends to raise additional capital in the series b financing from other investors and has engaged a placement agent in connection with the contemplated additional financing grail intends to close the series b prior to the end of march 2017 as of the closing of this transaction we expect our voting interest to become less than 20 percent and that our remaining interest in grail will be treated as a costmethod investment in addition we will no longer have representation on grail’s board of directors any failure by grail to close the contemplated financing transactions would have a significant negative impact on its ability to grow such a failure 

 17 

could also result in the continued consolidation of grail within our financial statements which would result in incremental dilution compared to fiscal year 2016 

  

security breaches including with respect to cybersecurity and other disruptions could compromise our information products and services and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions as a leader in the field of genetic analysis we may face cyberattacks that attempt to penetrate our network security including our data centers sabotage or otherwise disable our research products and services including instruments at our customers’ sites misappropriate our or our customers and partners proprietary information which may include personally identifiable information or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and damage to our reputation 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government   regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may   be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

our products are not subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis treatment or prevention of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as our fdaregulated miseqdx certain of our products will become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable international agencies including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

molecular diagnostic products are regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable international agencies and may require either clearance from the fda following the 510k premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition if our products labeled as “for research use only not for use in diagnostic procedures” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could change or be uncertain even if such use by our customers is without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

if the fda requires in the future that any of our ldt products be subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion to not regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however the fda has been reconsidering its enforcement discretion policy and has commented that regulation of ldts may be warranted because of the growth in the volume and complexity of testing services utilizing ldts in october 2014 the fda published two draft guidance documents suggesting an approach for registration and listing of laboratories and assays along with a framework for regulation of ldts by the fda based on risk to patients rather than whether the ldts were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory the draft framework guidance includes premarket review for higherrisk ldts including many used to guide treatment decisions as well as companion diagnostics that have entered the market as ldts we cannot predict the nature or extent of the fdas final guidance or regulation of ldts in general or with respect to our ldts in particular if the fda requires in the future that 

 18 

ldt products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

if product or service liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us we may face reduced demand for our products and incur significant liabilities 

our products and services are used for sensitive applications and we face an inherent risk of exposure to product or service liability claims if our products or services are alleged to have caused harm resulted in false negatives or false positives or do not perform in accordance with specifications product liability claims filed against us or against third parties to whom we may have an obligation could be costly and timeconsuming to defend and result in substantial damages or reputational risk we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully defend any product or service liability lawsuit brought against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome product or service liability claims may result in 

 although we carry product and service liability insurance if we become the subject of a successful product or service liability lawsuit our insurance may not cover all substantial liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our   business 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe the asiapacific region and brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in singapore shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 46  46  and 49  of our total revenue for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

during 2016  a significant portion of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies while the majority of our purchases of raw materials were denominated in us dollars changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations recent global financial conditions have led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to the foregoing risks international operations entail the following risks 



 19 

 additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials anticompetition regulations and sanctions imposed by the us office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax policies laws regulations or rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation location of operations changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the us internal revenue service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company on its tax returns we could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if material payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be   able to sustain operating profitability 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the timing and availability of our customers’ funding the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final weeks of the quarter in light of that our revenue cutoff and recognition procedures together with our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter 

a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel to meet the anticipated growth in our business we may incur fixed expenses such as costs related to facility expansions before we generate revenue sufficient to fully support such expenses in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash sharebased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from 

 20 

such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

we may not be able to convert our order backlog into revenue 

our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balancesheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products we may not receive revenue from some of these orders and the order backlog we report may not be indicative of our future revenue many events can cause an order to be delayed or not completed at all some of which may be out of our control if we delay fulfilling customer orders or if customers reconsider their orders those customers may seek to cancel or modify their orders with us customers may otherwise seek to cancel or delay their orders even if we are prepared to fulfill them if our orders in backlog do not result in sales our operating results may suffer 

disruption of critical information technology systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could have an adverse effect on our operations business customer relations and financial condition 

information technology systems it help us operate efficiently interface with customers maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including product manufacturing and supply chain sales forecast order fulfillment and billing customer service logistics and management of financial reports and data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures power loss natural disasters human acts computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences disruption of our operations which could harm our reputation and financial results 

  

if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper it infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach if our data management systems do not effectively collect store process and report relevant data for the operation of our business whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints software deficiencies or human error our ability to effectively plan forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired any such impairment could adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results 

as we continuously adjust our workflow and business practices and add additional functionality to our enterprise resource planning software and other software applications problems could arise that we have not foreseen including interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments   by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our   financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments in particular accounting rules related to companies that we form together with or that receive substantial funding from thirdparty investors such as grail and helix are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

 21 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could   reduce demand for our products or services 

our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops other food sources and other living organisms the information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information including preimplantation genetic screening of embryos prenatal genetic testing genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions particularly for those that have no known cure governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses 

as of january 1 2017  we had 6325 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2019 and 5175 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2021 outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 29  with respect to convertible notes due 2019 and 35  with respect to convertible notes due 2021 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include antitakeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us our certificate of incorporation has provisions that give our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 

in addition certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law dgcl including section 203 of the dgcl may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina section 203 of the dgcl provides with certain exceptions for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15 and less than 85 of the voting stock exclusive of stock held by directors officers and employee plans of a company 

the above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock

this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for additional factors relating to such statements see “risk factors” in item 1a of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business financial condition and results of operations operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 

business overview and outlook 

our company is organized into three operating segments for purposes of evaluating our business operations and reviewing our financial results one segment consists of illumina’s core operations core illumina the other two segments relate to the activities of our consolidated variable interest entities vies grail and helix the combined results of operations of our consolidated vies became material during the year ended january 1 2017 as such we commenced reporting two segments core illumina and consolidated vies during 2016 for information on grail and helix refer to note “12 segment information geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our focus on innovation has established us as the global leader in sequencing and arraybased technologies serving customers in a wide range of markets enabling the adoption of genomic solutions in research and clinical settings

consolidated financial highlights include the following 

  

 

 

 

 

our future effective tax rate may vary from the us federal statutory tax rate due to the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor “we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions” in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k we may 

 27 

also be adversely impacted in the future if the tax court opinion regarding the exclusion of stock compensation from costsharing charges is overturned we anticipate that our effective tax rate will trend lower than the us federal statutory tax rate in the future due to the portion of our earnings that will be subject to lower statutory tax rates 

 

this overview and outlook provides a highlevel discussion of our operating results and significant known trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important to understanding our financial results for the periods reported herein as well as our future financial performance this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

revenue 



product revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of consumables and instruments service and other revenue consists primarily of sequencing and genotyping service revenue as well as instrument service contract revenue our consolidated vies are in the development stage and have no revenues to date 

2016  compared to 2015 

revenue increased   1786 million  or 8  to 23984 million  in 2016  compared to 22198 million  in 2015  

consumables revenue increased   2636 million  or 21  to 15435 million  in 2016  compared to 12799 million  in 2015  driven by growth in the sequencing instrument installed base 

instrument revenue decreased   1252 million  or 21  to 4695 million  in 2016  compared to 5947 million  in 2015  primarily due to lower shipments of our highthroughput platforms 

service and other revenue increased   372 million  or 11  to 3664 million  in 2016  compared to 3291 million  in 2015  driven by revenue from genotyping services and instrument service contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base partially offset by our nipt customers shifting to inhouse testing on our sequencers 

2015  compared to 2014 

revenue increased   3584 million  or 19  to 22198 million  in 2015  compared to 18614 million  in 2014  

consumables revenue increased   2389 million  or 23  to 12799 million  in 2015  compared to 10410 million  in the prior year driven by growth in the sequencing instrument installed base 

instrument revenue increased   325 million  or 6  to 5947 million  in 2015  compared to 5622 million  in the prior year driven by shipments of hiseq x and nextseq systems 

  

service and other revenue increased   873 million  or 36  to 3291 million  in 2015  compared to 2418 million  in the prior year driven by the growth in nipt service test volumes    revenue from instrument service contracts also contributed to the increase as our sequencing instrument installed base continues to grow 

overall these increases were negatively impacted by the foreign exchange fluctuations in the comparative periods absent these fluctuations revenues would have grown 23 on a constant currency basis from 2014 to 2015 

gross margin 



 29 

2016  compared to 2015 

gross margin decreased  to 695  in 2016  compared to 698  in 2015 gross margin decreased  primarily due to our   increased manufacturing capacity which was partially offset by a greater mix of sequencing consumables 

2015  compared to 2014 

gross margin increased  to 698  compared to 697  in the prior year gross margin increased primarily due to a positive shift in product mix to sequencing consumables gross margin in 2014 was favorably impacted by the litigation settlement with syntrix which included a reversal of cost of sales of 104 million see detailed discussions on this matter in note “9 legal proceedings” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

operating expense 



2016  compared to 2015 

research and development rd expense increased  by 1029 million  or 26  in 2016  from 2015  core illumina rd expense increased by 599 million or 15 primarily due to increased headcount and outside services as we continue to invest in the development of new products as well as enhancements to existing products our consolidated vies contributed 430 million to the increase primarily due to 337 million incurred by grail 

  

selling general and administrative sga expense increased  by 583 million  or 11  in 2016  from 2015  core illumina sga expense increased 355 million or 7 primarily due to headcount and facilities investment to support the continued growth and scale of our operations as well as outside services grail and helix contributed 137 million and 91 million to the increase respectively 

legal contingencies in 2016  represent a reversal of prior year expense related to the settlement of patent litigation 

2015  compared to 2014 

research and development expense increased by 135 million  or 3  in 2015  from 2014  primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses as we continue to invest in the development of our products as well as enhancements to existing products research and development expense in 2014  included our litigation settlement and patent pooling agreement with sequenom as 488 million was recorded to research and development expense for an upfront payment see detailed discussion on this matter in note “9 legal proceedings” to our financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased by 584 million  or 13  in 2015  from 2014  primarily driven by increased headcount and consulting services to support our continued growth investments in scaling our operations and startup costs related to helix 

legal contingencies in 2015  represent charges related to patent litigation legal contingencies in 2014  reflected predominantly the 821 million  gain from our litigation settlement with syntrix offset by other legal contingency charges 

acquisition related gain net in 2015  and 2014  consisted of changes in fair value of contingent consideration the changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the periods were primarily due to changes in the estimated payments and a shorter discounting period 

 30 

headquarter relocation costs for 2015  include a net gain related to a change in a lease exit liability partially offset by accretion of interest on such liability 

other expense income net 



2016  compared to 2015 

interest income increased in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of higher yields on our investments and higher savings and money market balances interest expense consisted primarily of accretion of discount on our convertible senior notes the decrease in interest expense in 2016  compared to 2015  was due to a lower outstanding principal balance on the 2016 notes which matured in march 2016 

  

other expense net  in 2016  is primarily attributable to 10 million related to equity method investment losses and 09 million in net foreign exchange loss other expense net  in 2015  consisted primarily of 43 million in net foreign exchange loss and a 41 million loss on extinguishment of debt 

2015  compared to 2014 

interest income primarily consisted of returns from our investment portfolio interest income increased  slightly in 2015  compared to 2014  as a result of higher yields and higher investment balances throughout the period interest expense consisted primarily of accretion of discount on our convertible senior notes the increase in interest expense in 2015  compared to 2014  was due to the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 notes in june 2014 partially offset by the impact from the concurrent repurchase of 6000 million in principal amount of our 2016 notes 

  

costmethod investment gain net  in 2015  consisted primarily of gains on dispositions of costmethod investments partially offset by impairment charges on other investments 

  

other expense net  in 2015  consisted primarily of 43 million in foreign exchange loss and 41 million in loss on extinguishment of our 2016 notes other expense net  in 2014 was negatively impacted by 314 million loss on extinguishment of debt recorded as a result of the repurchase of 6000 million in principal amount of our 2016 notes   

provision for income taxes 



2016  compared to 2015 

our effective tax rate was 237  and 216  in 2016  and 2015  respectively in 2016 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom partially offset by the tax impact associated with the investments in our consolidated variable interest entities in 2015 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable to a discrete tax benefit of 248 million related to the exclusion of stock compensation from 

 31 

prior period costsharing charges as a result of a tax court opinion in which an unrelated third party was successful in challenging such charges the decrease from the us federal statutory tax rate also resulted from the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as in singapore and the united kingdom 

2015  compared to 2014 

our effective tax rate was 216 and 213 in 2015 and 2014 respectively in 2015 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was attributable to a discrete tax benefit of 248 million related to the exclusion of stock compensation from prior period costsharing charges as a result of a tax court opinion in which an unrelated third party was successful in challenging such charges in 2015 and 2014 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was also attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as singapore and the united kingdom 

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 1 2017  we had approximately 7345 million  in cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 4442 million  was held by our foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents held by our consolidated vies as of january 1 2017  were 759 million  cash and cash equivalents decreased by 343 million  from last year due to the factors described in the “cash flow summary” below our primary source of liquidity other than our holdings of cash cash equivalents and investments has been cash flows from operations our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

historically we have liquidated our shortterm investments andor issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities as of january 1 2017  we had 8242 million  in shortterm investments shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries as of january 1 2017  were approximately 3055 million  our shortterm investments include marketable securities consisting of us governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities 

during 2016  755 million  in principal of the 2016 notes were converted the 2016 notes became convertible on april 1 2014 through and including march 11 2016 all 2016 notes were converted by march 11 2016 the convertible senior notes due 2019 and 2021 were not convertible as of january 1 2017  

we anticipate that our current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash provided by operating activities are sufficient to fund our near term capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include 

   

during 2016 we used 2493 million  to repurchase our outstanding shares under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors as of january 1 2017  1007 million  remains under the authorized program 

certain noncontrolling helix investors may require illumina to redeem all noncontrolling interests in cash at the then approximate fair market value such redemption right is exercisable at the option of certain noncontrolling interest holders after january 1 2021 provided that a bona fide pursuit of the sale of helix has occurred and an initial public offering of helix 

 32 

has not been completed the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests related to helix as of january 1 2017  was 426 million  

on april 14 2016 we announced our commitment to invest 1000 million  in a new venture capital investment fund venture fund established by nicholas naclerio phd our former senior vice president corporate and venture development the capital commitment is callable over ten years and up to 400 million can be drawn down during the first year during 2016  the company transferred 32 million  of its costmethod investments to the venture fund and contributed 74 million  in cash 

we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1 organization and significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

revenue recognition 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing services and instrument service contracts the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgment and estimates 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met we occasionally offer discounts on newly introduced products to recent customers of existing products these promotions sometimes involve the tradein of existing products in exchange for a discount on new products where applicable we defer a portion of revenue on the sales of existing products in recognition of the promotional discounts until the delivery of new products all revenue is recorded net of discounts and sales taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities 

revenue from product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered typically evenly over the contract term revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether an arrangement is cancellable or subject to future changes in price deliverables or other terms if it is determined that the price is not fixed or determinable we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 

we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including products or services these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame approximately three to six months after the contract execution date revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a standalone basis 

for transactions with multiple deliverables consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence exists we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 

in order to establish vsoe of selling price we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry we have rarely established selling price using thirdparty evidence if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

in certain markets we sell products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products in most sales through distributors the product is delivered directly to customers in cases where the product is delivered to a distributor revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor andor the enduser if required by the applicable sales contract the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers these transactions are accounted for in accordance with our revenue recognition policy described herein

investments 

we invest in various types of securities including debt securities in governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities as of january 1 2017  we had 8242 million  in shortterm investments in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we classify our investments as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 

as discussed in note “4 fair value measurements” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level 2 these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly such as yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings and in the process we apply judgment and estimates that if changed could significantly affect our statement of financial positions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at lower of cost or market we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycles quality issues historical experience and usage forecasts our gross inventory totaled 3445 million  and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was 443 million  at january 1 2017  historically our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses however if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assess on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors which include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates resulting in a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the fair values assigned defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets net of liabilities assumed as goodwill these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with 

 37 

respect to intangible assets 

in connection with certain of our acquisitions additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones in these cases a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable inputs such as anticipated future cash flows riskfree adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related gain expense net a component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income this method requires significant management judgment including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 

management typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our longlived assets are impaired a review of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment if indicators of impairment exist we assess the recoverability of the affected longlived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts 

in order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows the time value of money and other factors that a willing market participant would consider significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our reporting unit we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

sharebased compensation 

we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

the determination of fair value of sharebased awards requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected life of an award expected dividends the riskfree interest rate and forecast of our future financial performance in the case of performance stock units we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon 

 38 

us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards we update our forecast of future financial performance periodically which impacts our estimate of the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the outstanding performance stock units we amortize the fair value of sharebased compensation on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards if any of the assumptions used change significantly sharebased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

warranties 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on instruments additionally we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve and adjust if necessary the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 

ceaseuse loss upon exit of facility 

we may from time to time relocate or consolidate our office locations and cease to use a facility for which the lease continues beyond the ceaseuse date we estimate ceaseuse loss as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period adjusted for deferred items and leasehold improvements in this process management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease including the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and the riskadjusted discount rate these assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates resulting in significant adjustments to the ceaseuse loss recorded 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of our future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies based on the available evidence as of january 1 2017  we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we recorded a valuation allowance of 181 million  against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined

interest rate sensitivity 

our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 

changes in interest rates may impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes in june 2014 we issued 6325 million  aggregate principal amount of 0  convertible senior notes due 2019 2019 notes and 5175 million  aggregate principal amount of 05  convertible senior notes due 2021 2021 notes at our election the notes are convertible into cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price at 130 above the conversion price the notes will become convertible upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our thencurrent incremental borrowing rate if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted the implicit interest rates for the 2019 and 2021 notes were 29  and 35  respectively an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of 1000 million aggregate principal amount of each of the 2019 and 2021 notes would result in losses of approximately 25 million  and 41 million  respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the company’s us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro yen and australian dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income 

we use forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the gains or losses from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities as of january 1 2017  the total notional amount of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was 688 million

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders of illumina inc 

we have audited illumina inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2017  based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria illumina inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion illumina inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2017  based on the coso criteria

genetics primer 

the instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna the complete set of dna for any organism is referred to as its genome dna contains small regions called genes which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively these nucleotide bases occur in a precise order known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a partial copy of its dna sequence called messenger rna mrna is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function the illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic 

variations among organisms are due in large part to differences in their dna sequences changes can result from insertions deletions inversions translocations or duplications of nucleotide bases these changes may result in certain genes becoming overexpressed excessive protein production underexpressed reduced protein production or silenced altogether sometimes triggering changes in cellular function these changes can be the result of heredity but most often they occur at random the most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide polymorphism snp which is a base change in a single position in a dna sequence another type of variation copy number variations cnvs occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes segments of a gene or stretches of dna 

in humans genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see eg height hair eye color etc genetic variations also can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease they can affect individual response to certain drug treatments causing patients to experience adverse side effects or to respond well or not at all 

scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans as well as in a broad range of animals plants and microorganisms such research takes place in government university pharmaceutical biotechnology and agrigenomics laboratories around the world where scientists expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life beginning at the genetic level illumina tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes lifescience research includes the study of the cells tissues organs systems and other components of living organisms this research supports the development of new treatments to improve human health examples include more tailored clinical treatments often referred to as precision medicine as well as advances in agriculture and animal husbandry to meet growing needs for food and energy researchers who investigate human viral and bacterial genetic variation to understand the mechanisms of disease are enabling the development of more effective diagnostics and therapeutics they also provide greater insight into genetic variation in plants eg food and biofuel crops and animals eg livestock and domestic enabling improvements in crop yields and animal breeding programs 

by empowering genetic analysis and facilitating a deeper understanding of genetic variation and function our tools advance disease research drug development and the creation of molecular diagnostic tests we believe that this will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and health care and that the increased emphasis on preventive and predictive molecular medicine will usher in the era of precision health care 

our principal markets 

our organization is structured to target the markets and customers outlined below 

 5 

life sciences 

historically our core business has been in the life sciences research market this includes laboratories associated with universities research centers and government institutions along with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions use our products and services for basic and translational research across a spectrum of scientific applications including targeted exome and wholegenome sequencing genetic variation gene expression epigenetics and metagenomics increasingly these techniques are migrating to nextgeneration sequencing ngs due to the declining costs of ngs technologies and the ability of ngs to provide vast amounts of data resulting in improved discovery performance as compared to arrays both private and public funding drive this research along with global initiatives to characterize genetic variation 

we also serve applied markets in life sciences such as agrigenomics forensic genomics and transplant biology in agrigenomics government and corporate researchers use our sequencing and arraybased tools to explore the genetic and biological basis for productivity and nutritional constitution in crops and livestock researchers can identify natural and novel genomic variation and deploy genomewide markerbased applications to accelerate breeding and production of healthier and higheryielding crops and livestock in forensic genomics major law enforcement agencies use sequencing to investigate criminal cases as do military and security intelligence agencies in transplant diagnostics we offer a sampletoanswer solution to perform high resolution hla typing in a single assay which enables users to determine how closely the tissues of one person match the tissues of another person 

clinical genomics 

we provide sampletoanswer solutions to our customers in two key areas of translational and clinical genomics reproductive and genetic health and oncology 

illumina provides reproductivehealth solutions including preimplantation genetic screening and diagnosis pgs and pgd noninvasive prenatal testing nipt and neonatal and genetic health testing our pgs solution is used with in vitro fertilization ivf to determine before implantation whether an embryo has an abnormal number of chromosomes which is a major cause of ivf failure and miscarriages in the case of pgd the technology determines which embryos are free from gene variants associated with genetic diseases our technology enables nipt for early identification of fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing cellfree dna in maternal blood 

cancer is a disease of the genome and the goal of cancer genomics is to identify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one understanding these genomic changes improves diagnostic accuracy increases understanding of the prognosis and enables oncologists to target therapies to individuals customers in the translational and clinical oncology markets use illumina sequencing and arraybased solutions to perform research that may help identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to cancer customers also utilize our technology to identify the molecular changes in a tumor so that physicians can tailor treatment based on the genetic variation we believe that circulating tumor dna ctdna will become an important clinical tool for managing oncology patients during all stages of tumor progression our technology is being used to research the implications of ctdna in treatment determination treatment monitoring minimal residual disease and asymptomatic screening in early 2016 we formed a new company grail inc which is majority owned by illumina and funded by illumina and outside investors to develop a pancancer screening test enabled by our sequencing technology 

to advance genomicbased precision oncology care we are working with key opinion leaders to set standards for ngsbased assays in routine clinical oncology practice and to define regulatory frameworks for this new testing paradigm 

enterprise informatics 

enterprise informatics solutions increase the utility of genomic data by allowing customers to aggregate analyze archive and share genomic data integrating our instruments with dataanalysis software allows customers to go from their biological sample through the raw genomic data to meaningful results our basespace platform which can be hosted onsite or in the cloud integrates directly with our sequencing instruments it facilitates data sharing provides datastorage solutions and streamlines analysis through a growing number of applications from illumina and the bioinformatics community 

in 2013 we acquired nextbio a platform for aggregating and analyzing large quantities of genomic and phenotypic data translational researchers use this tool to understand the efficacy of drug therapies and identify trends in patient outcomes we believe that largescale genomic databases containing genomic and phenotypic information will enhance the value of human genome sequencing and accelerate the pace of discovery

our principal products and technologies 

our unique technology platforms support the scale of experimentation necessary for populationscale studies genomewide discovery target selection and validation studies see figure 1 below customers use our products to analyze the genome at all levels of complexity from wholegenome sequencing to targeted panels a large and dynamic illumina user community has published approximately 32000 customerauthored scientific papers using our technologies through rapid innovation we are changing the economics of genetic research enabling projects that were previously considered impossible and supporting clinical advances towards precision medicine 

most of our product sales consist of instruments and consumables which include reagents flow cells and microarrays based on our proprietary technologies for the fiscal years ended january 3 2016  december 28 2014  and december 29 2013  instrument sales comprised 27  30  and 26  respectively of total revenues and consumable sales represented 58  56  and 62  respectively of total revenues 

  

figure 1 illumina platform overview   

sequencing 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases a c g or t in a dna sample our portfolio of sequencing platforms represents a family of systems that we believe set the standard for productivity costeffectiveness and accuracy among ngs technologies customers use our platforms to perform wholegenome de novo and exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of specific gene regions and genes 

wholegenome sequencing determines the complete dna sequence of an organism in de novo sequencing the goal is to sequence and analyze a sample without using information from prior sequencing of that species in targeted resequencing a portion of the sequence of an organism is compared to a standard or reference sequence from previously sequenced samples to identify genetic variation understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between and within species helps us understand the function of the structures encoded in the dna 

our dna sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminatorbased sequencing chemistry referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry sbs tracks the addition of labeled nucleotides as the dna chain is copied in a massively parallel fashion our sbs sequencing technology provides researchers with a broad range of applications and the ability to sequence even large mammalian genomes in a day rather than weeks or years 

our sequencing platforms can generate between 500 megabases mb and 18 terabases tb equivalent to 16 human genomes of genomic data in a single run depending on the instrument and application there are different price points per gigabase gb for each instrument and for different applications which range from smallgenome amplicon and targeted genepanel sequencing to populationscale whole human genome sequencing since we launched our first sequencing system 

 7 

in 2007 our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a factor of 10000 in addition the sequencing time per gb has dropped by a factor of nearly 2000 

for the fiscal years ended january 3 2016 december 28 2014 and december 29 2013 sequencing revenue comprised 86    81  and   73  respectively of total revenues 

arrays 

arrays are used for a broad range of dna and rna analysis applications including snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression analysis and methylation analysis and allow for the detection of millions of known genetic markers on a single array 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously this facilitates largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a uniquely highthroughput costeffective and flexible manner using our beadarray technology we achieve highthroughput analysis via a high density of test sites per array and the ability to format arrays in various configurations varying the size shape and format of the substrate into which the beads selfassemble and creating specific bead types for different applications lets us address multiple markets and market segments both our iscan array scanner system and our nextseq 550 system can be used to image the arrays 

for the fiscal years ended january 3 2016 december 28 2014 and december 29 2013 array revenue comprised 14  19  and 27  respectively of total revenues 

consumables 

we have developed various library preparation and sequencing kits to simplify workflows and accelerate analysis our sequencing applications include wholegenome sequencing kits which sequence entire genomes of any size and complexity and targeted resequencing kits which can sequence exomes specific genes or other genomic regions of interest our sequencing kits maximize the ability of our customers to characterize the target genome accurately 

customers use illumina arraybased genotyping consumables for a wide range of analyses including diverse species diseaserelated mutations and genetic characteristics associated with cancer customers can select from a range of human animal and agriculturally relevant genome panels or create their own custom arrays to investigate millions of genetic markers targeting any species 

our services 

in addition to selling products we provide wholegenome sequencing genotyping and nipt services human wholegenome sequencing services are provided through our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory using our services customers can perform wholegenome sequencing projects including phasing and longread sequencing services and microarray projects including largescale genotyping studies and wholegenome association studies we also provide nipt services through our partner laboratories that direct samples to us on a test sendout basis in our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory 

intellectual property 

we have an extensive intellectual property portfolio as of february 1 2016 we own or have exclusive licenses to 577 issued us patents and 406 pending us patent applications including 34 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents our issued patents cover various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments digital microfluidics and chemicaldetection technologies and have terms that expire between 2016 and 2036 we continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies we have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries 

we protect trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and processes preserving trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks operating without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and acquiring licenses for technology or products 

 8 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our sequencing and array technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2016 and 2032 we have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties 

research and development 

illumina has historically made substantial investments in research and development our research and development efforts prioritize continuous innovation coupled with product evolution 

research and development expenses for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were 4015 million  3881 million  and 2767 million  respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2016  to support business growth and continuing expansion in research and productdevelopment efforts 

marketing and distribution 

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe latin america and the asiapacific region in each of these areas dedicated sales service and applicationsupport personnel are expanding and supporting their respective customer bases in addition we sell through lifescience distributors in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region latin america the middle east and south africa we expect to continue increasing our sales and distribution resources during 2016  and beyond as we launch new products and expand our potential customer base 

manufacturing 

we manufacture sequencing and array platforms reagent kits and scanning equipment in 2015 we continued to increase our manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand to address increasing product complexity and volume we continue to automate manufacturing processes to accelerate throughput and improve quality and yield we are committed to providing medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances our key manufacturing and distribution facilities operate under a quality management system certified to iso 13485 

raw materials 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies multiple commercial sources provide many of our components and supplies but there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from singlesource suppliers to manage potential risks arising from single source suppliers we believe that we could redesign our products using alternative components or for use with alternative reagents if necessary in addition while we attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 

  

competition 

although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect continued intense competition our competitors offer products and services for sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets they include companies such as affymetrix inc agilent technologies inc bgi pacific biosciences of california inc qiagen nv roche holding ag and thermo fisher scientific inc among others some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources than we do along with larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase to compete effectively we must scale our organization and infrastructure appropriately and demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy 

 9 

segment and geographic information 

in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for segment reporting we have determined that we have one reportable segment for purposes of recording and reporting our financial results 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 10124 million  or 46  of our total revenue during fiscal 2015  compared to 9107 million  or 49  and 7065 million  or 50  in fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively the us dollar has been determined to be the functional currency of the company’s international operations due to the primary activities of our foreign subsidiaries we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note “12 segment information geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately 560 million  as of january 3 2016  generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balancesheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom we expect most of the backlog as of january 3 2016  to be shipped within the fiscal year ending january 1 2017  with the most notable exception being 130 million  in backlog related to the genomics england sequencing services project although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer some customer agreements or applicable accounting treatments might require us to defer the recognition of revenue beyond title transfer 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to various federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe that we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

government regulation 

as we expand product lines to address the diagnosis of disease regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will become an increasingly significant factor in development testing production and marketing products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies in other countries in the united states certain of our products may require fda clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda before marketing the shorter 510k clearance process which we used for the fdacleared assays that are run on our fdaregulated miseqdx instrument generally takes from three to six months after submission but it can take significantly longer the longer pma process is much more costly and uncertain it generally takes from 9 to 18 months after a complete filing but it can take significantly longer and typically requires conducting clinical studies which are not always needed for a 510k clearance all of the products that are currently regulated by the fda as medical devices are also subject to the fda quality system regulation qsr obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals including the fda quality system inspections that are required for pma approval can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

we cannot be certain which of our planned molecular diagnostic products will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process and in fact some of our products may need to go through the pma process the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed may be significantly more expensive than anticipated and may conclude without such products being approved by the fda without timely regulatory approval we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products this may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or 

 10 

comparable regulatory approval of our products in addition the fda may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for either or both illumina or illumina customers 

if our products labeled as “research use only” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could be uncertain this is true even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

illumina products sold as medical devices in europe will be regulated under the in vitro diagnostics directive 9879ec this regulation includes requirements for both presentation and review of performance data and qualitysystem requirements 

certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion to not regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however as discussed in more detail under “risk factors” the fda is reexamining this regulatory approach and changes to the agency’s handling of ldts could impact our business in ways that cannot be predicted at this time certification of clia laboratories includes standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management and quality control procedures clia also mandates that for high complexity labs such as ours to operate as a lab we must have an accreditation by an organization recognized by clia such as the college of pathologists cap which we have obtained and must maintain if we were to lose our cap accreditation our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in addition state laboratory licensing and inspection requirements may also apply to our products which in some cases are more stringent than clia requirements 

  

employees 

as of january 3 2016  we had more than 4600  employees we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

if we do not successfully manage the development manufacturing and launch of new products or   services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely   affected 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions or transition requirements or programs with respect to newly launched products or products in development which could adversely affect sales of our existing products for instance in january 2016 we announced an expansion to our sequencing instrument platforms the miniseq system and we previewed a new sequencing system currently under development that will deploy sbs chemistry on a semiconductor chip if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle we may delay the product launch date the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

when we introduce or announce new or enhanced products we face numerous risks relating to product transitions including the inability to accurately forecast demand including with respect to our existing products manage excess and obsolete inventories address new or higher product cost structures and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new or enhanced products announcements of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing our products until new products become available our failure to effectively manage product transitions or introductions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences diagnostic agricultural and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are relatively new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect 

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a wide range of competing technologies we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render one or more of our technologies obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences clinical genomics and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new   products 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on developing and commercializing new products and services including improving our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products there can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

  12 

 we may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace 

if defects are discovered in our products we may incur additional unforeseen costs our products may be subject to recalls customers may not purchase our products our reputation may suffer and ultimately our   sales and operating earnings could be negatively   impacted 

our products incorporate complex precisionmanufactured mechanical parts electrical components optical components and fluidics as well as computer software any of which may contain errors or failures especially when first introduced in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products in addition new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that despite testing are discovered only after commercial shipment defects or errors in our products may discourage customers from purchasing our products the costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating margins identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and thirdparty components may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur because our products are designed to be used to perform complex genomic analysis we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects if we do not meet applicable regulatory or quality standards our products may be subject to recall and under certain circumstances we may be required to notify applicable regulatory authorities about a recall if our products are subject to recall or shipment holds our reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

as we develop market or sell diagnostic tests we may encounter delays in receipt or limits in the amount of reimbursement approvals and public health funding which will impact our ability to grow revenues in the healthcare market 

physicians and patients may not order diagnostic tests that we develop market or sell such as our verifi prenatal test unless thirdparty payors such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid and governmental payors outside of the united states pay a substantial portion of the test price thirdparty payors are often reluctant to reimburse healthcare providers for the use of medical tests that involve new technologies or provide novel diagnostic information in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly limiting reimbursement coverage for medical diagnostic products and in many instances are exerting pressure on diagnostic product suppliers to reduce their prices reimbursement by a payor may depend on a number of factors including a payors determination that tests using our technologies are 

 since each thirdparty payor often makes reimbursement decisions on an individual patient basis obtaining such approvals is a timeconsuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical data supporting the clinical benefits of each of our products as a result there can be no assurance that reimbursement approvals will be obtained this 

 13 

process can delay the broad market introduction of new products and could have a negative effect on our results of operations as a result thirdparty reimbursement may not be consistent or financially adequate to cover the cost of diagnostic products that we develop market or sell this could limit our ability to sell our products or cause us to reduce prices which would adversely affect our results of operations 

even if our tests are being reimbursed third party payors may withdraw their coverage policies cancel their contracts with our customers at any time review and adjust the rate of reimbursement require copayments from patients or stop paying for our tests which would reduce our revenues in addition insurers including managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid have increased their efforts to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services these measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization for the clinical laboratory industry reductions in the reimbursement rate of payors may occur in the future reductions in the prices at which our tests are reimbursed could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for some of our products or subassemblies components and materials   used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are   delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the products components or materials supplied do   not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our   products in a timely manner or at all 

the complex nature of our products requires customized precisionmanufactured subassemblies components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some subassemblies components and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these subassemblies components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products in whole or in part or develop these capabilities internally and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms in addition the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier the time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields any of which would negatively impact our operating results accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the products subassemblies components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the democratic republic of the congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production or increase our costs any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

litigation other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property   infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent   us from selling our products or services 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets or introduce new products we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual impact of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products or services and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products or services in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins and earnings per share in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing 

 14 

products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue 

the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe in particular focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting uncertain economic growth funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable other programs such as defense entitlement programs or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities such as the us national institute of health or nih past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced nih and other research and development allocations any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we   may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or   technologies 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  15 

in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing or service capacity and develop and maintain   operation of our manufacturing or service capability we may not be able to launch or support   our products or services in a timely manner or at all 

we continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing and service capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing and service capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing and service capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments consumables and products that contain dna and enzymes we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

an interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials due to a catastrophic disaster or infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and the san francisco bay area in california madison wisconsin and singapore these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products in addition if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 

many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results 

 16 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional   personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

our future success depends upon the continuing services of members of our senior management team and scientific and engineering personnel the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing software engineering sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science and technology companies universities and research institutions competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco areas is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel could prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use sharebased compensation including restricted stock units and performance stock units to attract key personnel incentivize them to remain with us and align their interests with those of the company by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our   competitive position 

the proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences genomics forensics agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our proprietary position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies in that regard certain patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information 

our strategic investments and joint ventures may result in losses 

we periodically make strategic investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business in addition we periodically form companies such as grail and helix that remain consolidated with our financial statements but receive substantial funding from thirdparty investors who are granted certain control and governance rights the market values of these strategic investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control otherthantemporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses related to our investment this could result in future charges to our earnings it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any longterm benefits associated with these strategic investments 

 17 

security breaches including with respect to cybersecurity and other disruptions could compromise our information products and services and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions as a leader in the field of genetic analysis we may face cyberattacks that attempt to penetrate our network security including our data centers sabotage or otherwise disable our research products and services including instruments at our customers’ sites misappropriate our or our customers and partners proprietary information which may include personally identifiable information or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and damage to our reputation 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government   regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may   be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

our products are not subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as our fdaregulated miseqdx certain of our products will become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable international agencies including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

molecular diagnostic products in particular depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable international agencies and may require either clearance from the fda following the 510k premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition if our products labeled as “research use only” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could be uncertain even if such use by our customers is without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

if the fda requires in the future that any of our ldt products be subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion to not regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however the fda has been reconsidering its enforcement discretion policy and has commented that regulation of ldts may be warranted because of the growth in the volume and complexity of testing services utilizing ldts in october 2014 the fda published two draft guidance documents suggesting an approach for registration and listing of laboratories and assays along with a framework for regulation of ldts by the fda based on risk to patients rather than whether the ldts were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory the draft framework guidance includes premarket review for higherrisk ldts including many used to guide treatment decisions as well as companion diagnostics that have entered the market as ldts we cannot predict the nature or extent of the fdas final guidance or regulation of ldts in general or with respect to our ldts in particular if the fda requires in the future that ldt products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

 18 

  

if product or service liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us we may face reduced demand for our products and incur significant liabilities 

our products and services are used for sensitive applications and we face an inherent risk of exposure to product or service liability claims if our products or services are alleged to have caused harm resulted in false negatives or false positives or do not perform in accordance with specifications product liability claims filed against us or against third parties who we may have an obligation could be costly and timeconsuming to defend and result in substantial damages or reputational risk we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully defend any product or service liability lawsuit brought against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome product or service liability claims may result in 

 although we carry product and service liability insurance if we become the subject of a successful product or service liability lawsuit our insurance may not cover all substantial liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our   business 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe the asiapacific region and brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in singapore shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 46  49  and 50  of our total revenue for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

during 2015  a significant portion of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies while the majority of our purchases of raw materials were denominated in us dollars changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations recent global financial conditions have led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to the foregoing risks international operations entail the following risks 

  19 

 we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax laws or tax rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the us internal revenue service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company on its tax returns we could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if material payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be   able to sustain operating profitability 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the timing and availability of our customers’ funding the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final weeks of the quarter in light of that our revenue cutoff and recognition procedures together with our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter 

a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel to meet the anticipated growth in our business we may incur fixed expenses such as costs related to facility expansions before we generate revenue sufficient to fully support such expenses in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash sharebased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

disruption of critical information technology systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could have an adverse effect on our operations business customer relations and financial condition 

information technology systems it help us operate efficiently interface with customers maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including product manufacturing and supply chain sales forecast order fulfillment and billing customer service logistics and management of financial reports and data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures power loss natural disasters human acts computer viruses computer denialof 

 20 

service attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences disruption of our operations which could harm our reputation and financial results 

  

if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper it infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach if our data management systems do not effectively collect store process and report relevant data for the operation of our business whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints software deficiencies or human error our ability to effectively plan forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired any such impairment could adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results 

as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our it systems in 2015 we implemented new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we continue to adjust our workflow and business practices and add additional functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen including interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments   by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our   financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments in particular accounting rules related to companies that we form together with or that receive substantial funding from thirdparty investors such as grail and helix are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could   reduce demand for our products or services 

our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops other food sources and other living organisms the information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information including preimplantation genetic screening of embryos prenatal genetic testing genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions particularly for those that have no known cure governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses 

as of january 3 2016  we had 755 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2016 6325 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2019 and 5175 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2021 outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of 8355  with respect to convertible notes due 2016 we believe that some noteholders will elect to convert the applicable notes upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 45  with respect to convertible notes due 2016 29  with respect to convertible notes due 2019 and 

 21 

35  with respect to convertible notes due 2021 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include antitakeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us our certificate of incorporation has provisions that give our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 

in addition certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law dgcl including section 203 of the dgcl may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina section 203 of the dgcl provides with certain exceptions for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15 and less than 85 of the voting stock exclusive of stock held by directors officers and employee plans of a company 

the above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock

legal proceedings

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assesses on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable results could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates each matter presents its own unique circumstances and prior litigation does not necessarily provide a reliable basis on which to predict the outcome or range of outcomes in any individual proceeding because of the uncertainties related to the occurrence amount and range of loss on any pending litigation or claim we are currently unable to predict their ultimate outcome and with respect to any pending litigation or claim where no liability has been accrued to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in the event that opposing litigants in outstanding litigations or claims ultimately succeed at trial and any subsequent appeals on their claims any potential loss or charges in excess of any established accruals individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows in the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs or becomes probable and potentially in future periods

this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for additional factors relating to such statements see “risk factors” in item 1a of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business financial condition and results of operations operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 

business overview and outlook 

our focus on innovation has established us as the global leader in sequencing and arraybased technologies serving customers in the research clinical and applied markets our products are used for applications in the life sciences oncology reproductive health agriculture and other emerging market segments 

our portfolio of integrated systems consumables and analysis tools is designed to accelerate and simplify genetic analysis this portfolio addresses a range of genomic complexity price points and throughput enabling customers to select the best solution for their research or clinical challenge 

financial highlights for 2015  include the following 

  

 

 

 

 

our future effective tax rate may vary from the us federal statutory tax rate due to the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor “we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions” in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k we may also be adversely impacted in the future if the tax court opinion regarding the exclusion of stock compensation from costsharing charges is overturned we anticipate that our effective tax rate will trend lower than the us federal statutory tax rate in the future due to the portion of our earnings that will be subject to lower statutory tax rates 

  27

revenue 



product revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of consumables and instruments service and other revenue consists primarily of sequencing and genotyping service revenue as well as instrument service contract revenue 

2015  compared to 2014 

revenue increased   3584 million  or 19  to 22198 million  in 2015  compared to 18614 million  in 2014  

consumables revenue increased   2389 million  or 23  to 12799 million  in 2015  compared to 10410 million  in 2014  driven by growth in the sequencing instrument installed base 

instrument revenue increased   325 million  or 6  to 5947 million  in 2015  compared to 5622 million  in 2014  driven by shipments of hiseq x and nextseq systems 

service and other revenue increased   873 million  or 36  to 3291 million  in 2015  compared to 2418 million  in 2014  driven by the growth in nipt service test volumes    revenue from extended instrument service contracts also contributed to the increase as our sequencing instrument installed base continues to grow 

overall these increases were negatively impacted by the foreign exchange fluctuations in the comparative periods absent these fluctuations revenues would have grown 23 on a constant currency basis from   2014  to 2015  

2014  compared to 2013 

revenue increased   4402 million  or 31  to 18614 million  in 2014  compared to 14212 million  in 2013  

consumables revenue increased   1607 million  or 18  to 10410 million  in 2014  compared to 8803 million  in the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to sales of sequencing consumables driven by the growth in the installed base including hiseq x and nextseq systems introduced in january 2014 such increase was partially offset by a decrease in array consumables 

instrument revenue increased   1907 million  or 51  to 5622 million  in 2014  compared to 3715 million  in the prior year driven primarily by shipments of sequencing instruments in particular hiseq x and nextseq systems introduced in january 2014 

  

service and other revenue increased   853 million  or 55  to 2418 million  in 2014  compared to 1565 million  in the prior year driven primarily by sequencing services and extended service contracts for our instruments as our installed base continues to grow 

gross margin 



2015  compared to 2014 

gross margin increased  to 698  in 2015  compared to 697  in 2014 gross margin increased primarily due to a positive shift in product mix to sequencing consumables gross margin in 2014 was favorably impacted by the litigation settlement 

 29 

with syntrix which included a reversal of cost of sales of 104 million see detailed discussions on this matter in note “9 legal proceedings” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

2014  compared to 2013 

gross margin increased  to 697  compared to 642  in the prior year primarily due to the increase in revenue also contributing to the increase in gross margin was our litigation settlement with syntrix in 2014 which resulted in reversal of cost of sales of 104 million see detailed discussions on this matter in note “9 legal proceedings” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in addition higher margins on sequencing instrument sales and efficiencies in manufacturing contributed to the increase in gross margin in 2013 gross margin was negatively affected by a 252 million impairment charge associated with the discontinuation of the eco and nupcr product lines 

operating expense 



2015  compared to 2014 

research and development expense increased  by 135 million  or 3  in 2015  from 2014  primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses as we continue to invest in the development of our products as well as enhancements to existing products research and development expense in 2014  included our litigation settlement and patent pooling agreement with sequenom as 488 million was recorded to research and development expense for an upfront payment see detailed discussion on this matter in note “9 legal proceedings” to our financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased  by 584 million  or 13  in 2015  from 2014  primarily driven by increased headcount and consulting services to support our continued growth investments in scaling our operations and startup costs related to our helix joint venture 

legal contingencies in 2015  represent charges related to patent litigation legal contingencies in 2014  reflected predominantly the 821 million  gain from our litigation settlement with syntrix offset by other legal contingency charges 

  

acquisition related gain net in 2015  and 2014  consisted of changes in fair value of contingent consideration the changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the periods were primarily due to changes in the estimated payments and a shorter discounting period 

headquarter relocation costs for 2015  include a net gain related to a change in a lease exit liability partially offset by accretion of interest on such liability 

2014  compared to 2013 

research and development expense increased by 1113 million  or 40  in 2014  from 2013  the increase is partially attributable to our litigation settlement and patent pooling agreement with sequenom in 2014 as 488 million was recorded to research and development expense for the upfront payment see detailed discussion on this matter in note “9 legal proceedings” to our financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in addition headcount increases and other expenses related to our new product launches contributed to the increase in research and development expenses reflecting our continued investment in the development of new products as well as enhancements to existing products 

  

 30 

selling general and administrative expense increased by 852 million  or 22  in 2014  from 2013  the increase is primarily driven by increases in headcount consulting services and infrastructure investment to support the growth of our company 

acquisition related gain net in 2014  and 2013  consisted of changes in fair value of contingent consideration and transaction related costs 

we completed the relocation of our headquarters in 2012 during 2014  and 2013 we incurred 56 million  and 26 million  respectively in additional headquarter relocation expense consisting primarily of changes in estimated lease exit liability recorded upon vacating our former headquarters and accretion expense related to such facility exit obligation 

legal contingencies in 2014  reflected predominantly the 821 million  gain from our litigation settlement with syntrix offset by other legal contingency charges the 1154 million  in legal contingencies in 2013 were primarily charges recorded for the syntrix litigation matter see detailed discussion on this matter in note “9 legal proceedings” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2013 we recorded 136 million  of expenses incurred in relation to an unsolicited tender offer in q1 2012 the expenses consisted primarily of advisory and legal fees the advisory service arrangement was completed in 2013 

other expense income net 



2015  compared to 2014 

interest income primarily consisted of returns from our investment portfolio interest income increased slightly in 2015  compared to 2014  as a result of higher yields and higher investment balances throughout the period interest expense consisted primarily of accretion of discount on our convertible senior notes the increase in interest expense in 2015  compared to 2014  was due to the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 notes in june 2014 partially offset by the impact from the concurrent repurchase of 6000 million in principal amount of our 2016 notes 

  

costmethod investment gain net  in 2015  consisted primarily of gains on dispositions of costmethod investments partially offset by impairment charges on other investments 

  

other expense net  in 2015  consisted primarily of 43 million in foreign exchange loss and 41 million  in loss on extinguishment of our 2016 notes other expense net  in 2014  was negatively impacted by 314 million loss on extinguishment of debt recorded as a result of the repurchase of 6000 million in principal amount of our 2016 notes 

2014  compared to 2013 

interest income primarily consisted of returns from our investment portfolio interest income decreased  slightly in 2014  compared to 2013  as a result of lower yields partially offset by the impact from a larger investment portfolio interest expense in 2014  remained relatively consistent to 2013  and consisted primarily of accretion on our convertible senior notes 

  

costmethod investment gain net  in 2014  consisted of a gain associated with additional proceeds received for a costmethod investment sold in a prior year in 2013 we recognized 614 million in gains from sales of costmethod investments of which 552 million related to the sale of our minority ownership interest in oxford nanopore technologies ltd 

  

other expense net  in 2014  and 2013  primarily consisted of loss on extinguishment of debt and net foreign exchange gains and losses in conjunction with the issuance of the 2019 and 2021 notes we used 12447 million in cash to repurchase 

 31 

6000 million in principal amount of the outstanding 2016 notes in privately negotiated transactions as a result we recorded 314 million in loss on extinguishment of debt calculated as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the liability component of the debt   

provision for income taxes 



2015  compared to 2014 

our effective tax rate was 216  and 213  in 2015  and 2014  respectively in 2015 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was attributable to a discrete tax benefit of 248 million related to the exclusion of stock compensation from prior period costsharing charges as a result of a recent tax court opinion in which an unrelated third party was successful in challenging such charges in 2015 and 2014 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was also attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as singapore and the united kingdom 

2014  compared to 2013 

our effective tax rate was 213  in 2014  and 2013  the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as singapore and the united kingdom in addition the variance in 2014 was also attributable to the benefit from research and development credits and foreign tax credits and the variance in 2013 was also attributable to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit for 2012 which was enacted in january 2013 these items offset the impact of recording a valuation allowance which was primarily related to the estimated limitation on utilizing foreign tax credits in the us 

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 3 2016  we had approximately 7688 million  in cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 360 million  was held by our foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents increased by 1326 million  from last year due to the factors described in the “cash flow summary” below our primary source of liquidity other than our holdings of cash cash equivalents and investments has been cash flows from operations our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

historically we have liquidated our shortterm investments andor issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities as of january 3 2016  we have 6175 million  in shortterm investments shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries as of january 3 2016  were approximately 388 million  our shortterm investments include marketable securities consisting of us governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities 

during 2015 2445 million  in principal of the 2016 notes were converted and 755 million  in principal amount of the 2016 notes remained outstanding as of january 3 2016  the 2016 notes became convertible on april 1 2014 and continue to be convertible through march 11 2016  and mature on march 15 2016 it is our intent and policy to settle conversions of the 2016 notes through combination settlement which essentially involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the principal amount and delivery of the excess of conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common stock the 2019 and 2021 notes were not convertible as of january 3 2016  

we anticipate that our current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash provided by operating activities are sufficient to fund our near term capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months operating 

 32 

needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include 

 

as of january 3 2016  we had 350 million  in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with a prior acquisition 

during 2015 we used 2743 million  to repurchase our outstanding shares under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors as of january 3 2016  there remains 2561 million  under the authorized programs 

certain noncontrolling helix investors may require illumina to redeem all noncontrolling interests in cash at the then approximate fair market value such redemption right is exercisable at the option of certain noncontrolling interest holders after january 1 2021 provided that a bona fide pursuit of the sale of helix has occurred and an initial public offering of helix has not been completed the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of january 3 2016  was 325 million  

we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated 

 35 

financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1 organization and significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing services and instrument service contracts the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgment and estimates 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met we occasionally offer discounts on newly introduced products to recent customers of existing products these promotions sometimes involve the tradein of existing products in exchange for a discount on new products where applicable we defer a portion of revenue on the sales of existing products in recognition of the promotional discounts until the delivery of new products all revenue is recorded net of discounts and sales taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities 

revenue from product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered typically evenly over the contract term revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether an arrangement is cancellable or subject to future changes in price deliverables or other terms if it is determined that the price is not fixed or determinable we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 

we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including products or services these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame approximately three to six months after the contract execution date revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a standalone basis 

for transactions with multiple deliverables consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence exists we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 

in order to establish vsoe of selling price we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry we have rarely established selling price using thirdparty evidence if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

in certain markets we sell products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products in most sales through distributors the product is delivered directly to customers in cases where the product is delivered to a distributor revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor andor the enduser 

 36 

if required by the applicable sales contract the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers these transactions are accounted for in accordance with our revenue recognition policy described herein 

investments 

we invest in various types of securities including debt securities in governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities as of january 3 2016  we had 6175 million  in shortterm investments in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we classify our investments as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 

as discussed in note “4 fair value measurements” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level 2 these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly such as yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings and in the process we apply judgment and estimates that if changed could significantly affect our statement of financial positions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at lower of cost or market we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycles quality issues historical experience and usage forecasts our gross inventory totaled 3029 million  and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was 321 million  at january 3 2016  historically our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses however if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assess on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors which include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates resulting in a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of 

 37 

acquisition the fair values assigned defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets net of liabilities assumed as goodwill these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

in connection with certain of our acquisitions additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones in these cases a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable inputs such as anticipated future cash flows riskfree adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related gain expense net a component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income this method requires significant management judgment including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 

management typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our longlived assets are impaired a review of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment if indicators of impairment exist we assess the recoverability of the affected longlived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts 

in order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows the time value of money and other factors that a willing market participant would consider significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our reporting unit we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

sharebased compensation 

we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

the determination of fair value of sharebased awards requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected life of an award expected dividends the riskfree interest rate and forecast of our future financial performance in the case of performance stock units we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors 

 38 

implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards we update our forecast of future financial performance periodically which impacts our estimate of the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the outstanding performance stock units we amortize the fair value of sharebased compensation on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards if any of the assumptions used change significantly sharebased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

warranties 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on instruments additionally we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve and adjust if necessary the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 

ceaseuse loss upon exit of facility 

we may from time to time relocate or consolidate our office locations and cease to use a facility for which the lease continues beyond the ceaseuse date we estimate ceaseuse loss as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period adjusted for deferred items and leasehold improvements in this process management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease including the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and the riskadjusted discount rate these assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates resulting in significant adjustments to the ceaseuse loss recorded 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of our future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies based on the available evidence as of january 3 2016  we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we recorded a valuation allowance of 134 million  against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined

interest rate sensitivity 

our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 

changes in interest rates may impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes in june 2014 we issued 6325 million  aggregate principal amount of 0  convertible senior notes due 2019 2019 notes and 5175 million  aggregate principal amount of 05  convertible senior notes due 2021 2021 notes similar to our 025 convertible senior notes due 2016 at our election the notes are convertible into cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price at 130 above the conversion price the notes will become convertible upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our thencurrent incremental borrowing rate if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted the implicit interest rates for the 2019 and 2021 notes were 29  and 35  respectively an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of 1000 million aggregate principal amount of each of the 2019 and 2021 notes would result in losses of approximately 33 million  and 48 million  respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the company’s us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro yen and australian dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income 

we use forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the gains or losses from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities as of january 3 2016  the total notional amount of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was 613 million

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

genetics primer 

the instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna the complete set of dna for any organism is referred to as its genome dna contains small regions called genes which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively these nucleotide bases occur in a precise order known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a partial copy of its dna sequence called messenger rna mrna is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function the illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic

variations among organisms are due in large part to differences in their dna sequences changes can result from insertions deletions inversions translocations or duplications of nucleotide bases these changes may result in certain genes becoming overexpressed excessive protein production underexpressed reduced protein production or silenced altogether sometimes triggering changes in cellular function these changes can be the result of heredity but most often they occur at random the most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide polymorphism snp which is a base change in a single position in a dna sequence another type of variation copy number variations cnvs occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes segments of a gene or stretches of dna 

in humans genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see eg height hair eye color etc genetic variations also can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease they can affect individual response to certain drug treatments causing patients to experience adverse side effects or to respond well or not at all 

scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans as well as in a broad range of animals plants and microorganisms   such research takes place in government university pharmaceutical biotechnology and agrigenomics laboratories around the world where scientists expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life beginning at the genetic level illumina tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes lifescience research includes the study of the cells tissues organs systems and other components of living organisms this research supports the development of new treatments to improve human health examples include more tailored clinical treatments often referred to as precision medicine as well as advances in agriculture and animal husbandry to meet growing needs for food and energy researchers who investigate human viral and bacterial genetic variation to understand the mechanisms of disease are enabling the development of more effective diagnostics and therapeutics they also provide greater insight into genetic variation in plants eg food and biofuel crops and animals eg livestock and domestic enabling improvements in crop yields and animal breeding programs 

by empowering genetic analysis and facilitating a deeper understanding of genetic variation and function our tools advance disease research drug development and the creation of molecular diagnostic tests we believe that this will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and health care the increased emphasis on preventive and predictive molecular medicine will usher in the era of precision health care 

our principal markets 

our business units are aligned to target the markets and customers outlined below 

life sciences 

historically our core business has been in the life sciences research market which includes laboratories associated with universities medical research centers and government institutions along with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions use our products and services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities for basic analysis and research including de novo  sequencing genetic variation analysis gene expression analysis epigenetics genome wide association studies and targeted screening increasingly these techniques are migrating to nextgeneration sequencing ngs due to the improved performance reduced complexity and declining costs of ngs technologies both private and public funding drive this research along with global initiatives to characterize genetic variation and the migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencingbased technologies 

we also provide products and services for other life sciences applied markets such as agrigenomics government and corporate researchers use our sequencing and arraybased tools to accelerate and enhance agricultural research identifying desirable traits in plants and animals leads to healthier and more productive crops and livestock 

reproductive and genetic health 

illumina technologies and products provide reproductivehealth solutions including preimplantation genetic screening pgs preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd noninvasive prenatal testing nipt and neonatal and genetic health testing our pgs solutions are used with invitro fertilization ivf to determine before implantation whether an embryo has an abnormal number of chromosomes which is a major cause of ivf failure and miscarriages our pgd solutions identify before implantation which embryos are free from gene variants associated with genetic diseases our nipt solutions provide noninvasive tests for early identification of fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing cellfree dna in maternal blood

oncology 

cancer is a disease of the genome and the goal of cancer genomics is to identify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one understanding these genomic changes allow for a more accurate diagnosis a better understanding of the prognosis and the ability to target therapies to individuals researchers and clinicians in the research translational and clinical oncology markets use illumina sequencing and arraybased solutions to identify the molecular changes in a tumor during all stages of tumor progression our solutions help transform discoveries into new treatments or therapies and create tests to predict patient response 

to advance genomicbased precision health care we are working with leading pharmaceutical companies to develop a universal ngsbased oncology test system for clinical trials of targeted cancer therapies the goal is to develop and commercialize a multigene panel for “companion therapeutic” selection we are also working with key thought leaders to set standards for ngsbased assays in routine clinical oncology practice and to define regulatory frameworks for this new testing paradigm 

enterprise informatics 

enterprise informatics solutions increase the utility of genomic data by allowing customers to aggregate analyze archive and share genomic data integrating our instruments with dataanalysis software solutions allows customers to go from their biological sample through the raw genomic data to meaningful results our basespace platform which can be hosted onsite or in the cloud integrates directly with our sequencing instruments it facilitates data sharing provides data storage solutions and streamlines sequencingdata analysis through a growing number of dataanalysis applications from illumina and the bioinformatics community 

in 2013 we acquired nextbio which provides a platform for aggregating and analyzing large quantities of genomic and phenotypic data translational research uses this approach to optimize drug therapies and identify trends in overall patient outcomes we believe that largescale genomic databases containing genomic and phenotypic information will enhance the value of human genome sequencing and accelerate the pace of discovery 

new and emerging opportunities 

our markets change rapidly in response to genomic innovations new applications and opportunities develop and evolve quickly we assess these against our corporate strategies and consider whether there is a compelling unmet need together with a strong opportunity to transform the market some of the markets that provide immediate and nearterm opportunities to expand the use of nextgeneration sequencing include 

 our principal products and technologies 

our unique technology platforms support the scale of experimentation necessary for populationscale studies genomewide discovery target selection and validation studies see figure 1 below customers use our products to analyze the genome at all levels of complexity from wholegenome sequencing to targeted panels a large and dynamic illumina user community has published more than 10000 customerauthored scientific papers using our technologies through rapid innovation we are changing the economics of genetic research enabling projects that were previously considered impossible and supporting clinical advances towards precision medicine 

most of our product sales consist of instruments and consumables which include reagents flow cells and microarrays based on our proprietary technologies for the fiscal years ended december 28 2014  december 29 2013  and december 30 2012  instrument sales comprised 30  26  and 27  respectively of total revenues and consumable sales represented 56  62  and 64  respectively of total revenues

sequencing 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases a c g or t in a dna sample our portfolio of sequencing platforms represents a family of systems that we believe set the standard for productivity costeffectiveness and accuracy among ngs technologies customers use our platforms to perform wholegenome de novo  and exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of specific gene regions and genes 

wholegenome sequencing determines the complete dna sequence of an organism in de novo  sequencing the goal is to sequence and analyze a sample without using information from prior sequencing of that species in targeted resequencing a portion of the sequence of an organism is compared to a standard or reference sequence from previously sequenced samples to identify genetic variation understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between and within species helps us understand the function of the structures encoded in the dna 

our dna sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminatorbased sequencing chemistry referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry sbs tracks the addition of labeled nucleotides as the dna chain is copied in a massively parallel fashion our sbs sequencing technology provides researchers with a broad range of applications and the ability to sequence even large mammalian genomes in days rather than weeks or years 

our sequencing platforms can generate between 500 megabases mb and 18 terabases tb equivalent to 16 human genomes of genomic data depending on the instrument and application there are different price points per gigabase gb for each instrument and for different applications which range from smallgenome amplicon and targeted genepanel sequencing to populationscale whole human genome sequencing since we launched our first sequencing system in 2007 our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a factor of 10000 in addition the sequencing time per gb has dropped by a factor of nearly 2000 

arrays 

arrays are used for a broad range of dna and rna analysis applications including snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression analysis and methylation analysis and allows for the detection of up to 5000000 known genetic markers on a single array 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously this facilitates largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a uniquely highthroughput costeffective and flexible manner using our beadarray technology we achieve highthroughput analysis via a high density of test sites per array and the ability to format arrays in various configurations we maximize cost effectiveness by reducing expensive consumables valuable sample input requirements and manufacturing costs varying the size shape and format of the well patterns and creating specific beadpools for different 

 7 

applications lets us address multiple markets and market segments our hiscan and iscan array scanner systems and our nextseq 550 system which we announced in january 2015 image the arrays 

consumables 

we have developed various library preparation and sequencing kits to simplify workflows and accelerate analysis our sequencing applications include wholegenome sequencing kits which sequence entire genomes of any size and complexity and targeted resequencing kits which can sequence exomes specific genes or other genomic regions of interest our sequencing kits maximize the ability of our customers to characterize the target genome accurately through our acquisition of epicentre technologies corporation in 2011 we acquired the proprietary nextera technology for nextgeneration sequencing library preparation this technology has enabled us to reduce sample input requirements simplify genetic analysis workflows and significantly reduce the time from sample preparation to answer 

customers use illumina arraybased genotyping consumables for a wide range of analyses including diverse species diseaserelated mutations and genetic characteristics associated with cancer customers can select from a range of human animal and agriculturally relevant genome panels or create their own custom arrays to investigate up to 5000000 genetic markers targeting any species 

our services 

in addition to selling products we provide genotyping nipt and wholegenome sequencing services human wholegenome sequencing services are provided through our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory we began offering genotyping services to academic institutions biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers in 2002 and added sequencing services in 2007 using our fasttrack services customers can perform wholegenome sequencing projects including phasing and longread sequencing services and microarray projects including largescale genotyping studies and wholegenome association studies we also provide nipt services through our partner laboratories that direct samples to us on a test sendout basis 

intellectual property 

we have an extensive intellectual property portfolio as of february 1 2015 we own or have exclusive licenses to 473 issued us patents and 421 pending us patent applications including 19 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents our issued patents cover various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments digital microfluidics and chemicaldetection technologies and have terms that expire between 2015 and 2035 we continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies we have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries 

we protect trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and processes preserving trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks operating without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and acquiring licenses for technology or products 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our sequencing and array technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2015 and 2030 we have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties 

research and development 

illumina has historically made substantial investments in research and development our research and development efforts prioritize continuous innovation coupled with product evolution 

research and development expenses for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were 3881 million  2767 million  and 2310 million  respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2015  to support business growth and continuing expansion in research and productdevelopment efforts

marketing and distribution 

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe latin america and the asiapacific region in each of these areas dedicated sales service and applicationsupport personnel are expanding and supporting their respective customer bases in addition we sell through lifescience distributors in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region latin america the middle east and south africa we expect to continue increasing our sales and distribution resources during 2015  and beyond as we launch new products and expand our potential customer base 

manufacturing 

illumina manufactures sequencing and array platforms reagent kits and scanning equipment in 2014 we continued to increase our manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand to address increasing product complexity and volume we are automating manufacturing processes to accelerate throughput and improve quality and yield illumina is committed to providing medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances our key manufacturing and distribution facilities operate under a quality management system certified to iso 13485 

raw materials 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies multiple commercial sources provide many of our components and supplies but there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from singlesource suppliers to manage potential risks arising from single source suppliers we believe that we could redesign our products using alternative components or for use with alternative reagents if necessary in addition while we attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 

  

competition 

although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect continued intense competition our competitors offer products and services for sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets they include companies such as affymetrix inc agilent technologies inc bgi pacific biosciences of california inc qiagen nv roche holding ag and thermo fisher scientific inc among others some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources than we do along with larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase to compete effectively we must scale our organization and infrastructure appropriately and demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy 

segment and geographic information 

in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for segment reporting we have determined that we have one reportable segment for purposes of recording and reporting our financial results 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 9107 million  or 49  of our total revenue during fiscal 2014  compared to 7065 million  or 50  and 5801 million  or 51  in fiscal 2013  and 2012  respectively the us dollar has been determined to be the functional currency of the company’s international operations due to the primary activities of our foreign subsidiaries we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note “13 segment information geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

 9 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately 540 million  and 330 million  as of december 28 2014  and december 29 2013  respectively approximately 130 million of our backlog as of december 28 2014  was associated with the genomics england sequencing services project the delivery of which is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balancesheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom we expect most of the backlog as of december 28 2014  to be shipped within the fiscal year ending january 3 2016  with the exception of the genomics england backlog although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer some customer agreements or applicable accounting treatments might require us to defer the recognition of revenue beyond title transfer 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to various federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe that we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

government regulation 

as we expand product lines to address the diagnosis of disease regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will become an increasingly significant factor in development testing production and marketing products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies in other countries in the united states certain of our products may require fda clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda before marketing the shorter 510k clearance process which we used for the fdacleared assays that are run on our fdaregulated miseqdx instrument generally takes from three to six months after submission but it can take significantly longer the longer pma process is much more costly and uncertain it generally takes from 9 to 18 months after a complete filing but it can take significantly longer and typically requires conducting clinical studies which are not always needed for a 510k clearance all of the products that are currently regulated by the fda as medical devices are also subject to the fda quality system regulation qsr obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals including the fda quality system inspections that are required for pma approval can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

we cannot be certain which of our planned molecular diagnostic products will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process and in fact some of our products may need to go through the pma process the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed may be significantly more expensive than anticipated and may conclude without such products being approved by the fda without timely regulatory approval we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products this may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products in addition the fda may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for either or both illumina or illumina customers 

if our products labeled as “research use only” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could be uncertain this is true even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

illumina products sold as medical devices in europe will be regulated under the in vitro diagnostics directive 9879ec this regulation includes requirements for both presentation and review of performance data and qualitysystem requirements 

certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or 

 10 

ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion to not regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however as discussed in more detail under “risk factors” the fda is reexamining this regulatory approach and changes to the agency’s handling of ldts could impact our business in ways that cannot be predicted at this time certification of clia laboratories includes standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management and quality control procedures clia also mandates that for high complexity labs such as ours to operate as a lab we must have an accreditation by an organization recognized by clia such as the college of pathologists cap which we have obtained and must maintain if we were to lose our cap accreditation our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in addition state laboratory licensing and inspection requirements may also apply to our products which in some cases are more stringent than clia requirements 

  

employees 

as of december 28 2014  we had more than 3700  employees we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

if we do not successfully manage the development manufacturing and launch of new products or   services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely   affected 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle we may delay the product launch date the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions or transition requirements or programs with respect to newly launched products or products in development which could adversely affect sales of our existing products for instance in january 2015 we announced significant expansions to our sequencing instrument platforms the hiseq x five system and the hiseq 30004000 systems when we introduce new or enhanced products we face numerous risks relating to product transitions including the inability to accurately forecast demand including with respect to our existing products manage excess and obsolete inventories address new or higher product cost structures and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new or enhanced products announcements of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing our products until new products become available our failure to effectively manage product transitions or introductions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a widerange of competing technologies we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

 11 

the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences diagnostic agricultural and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new   products 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on developing and commercializing new products and services including improving our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products there can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

 we may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace 

 12 

if defects are discovered in our products we may incur additional unforeseen costs our products may be subject to recalls customers may not purchase our products our reputation may suffer and ultimately our   sales and operating earnings could be negatively   impacted 

our products incorporate complex precisionmanufactured mechanical parts electrical components optical components and fluidics as well as computer software any of which may contain errors or failures especially when first introduced in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products in addition new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that despite testing are discovered only after commercial shipment identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and thirdparty components may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur because our products are designed to be used to perform complex genomic analysis we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects if we do not meet applicable regulatory or quality standards our products may be subject to recall and under certain circumstances we may be required to notify applicable regulatory authorities about a recall if our products are subject to recall or shipment holds our reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

litigation other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property   infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent   us from selling our products or services 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets or introduce new products we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual impact of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products or services and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products or services in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins and earnings per share in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for some of our products or components and materials   used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are   delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the products components or materials supplied do   not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our   products in a timely manner or at all 

the complex nature of our products requires customized precisionmanufactured components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some components and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms in addition the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier the time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields any of which would negatively impact our operating results accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the products components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the democratic republic of the congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products could restrict the supply 

 13 

of components and materials used in production or increase our costs any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations 

as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen including interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue 

the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe in particular focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting uncertain economic growth funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable other programs such as defense entitlement programs or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities such as the us national institute of health or nih past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced nih and other research and development allocations any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we   may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or   technologies 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  14 

 in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing or service capacity and develop and maintain   operation of our manufacturing or service capability we may not be able to launch or support   our products or services in a timely manner or at all 

we continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing and service capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing and service capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing and service capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments consumables and products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

an interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials due to a catastrophic disaster or infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and the san francisco bay area in california madison wisconsin and singapore these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products in addition if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped due to disasters quality regulatory or other reasons it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 

many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems  certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results 

 15 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional   personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our chief executive officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco areas is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use sharebased compensation including restricted stock units and performance stock units to attract key personnel incentivize them to remain with us and align their interests with those of the company by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our   competitive position 

the proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences genomics forensics agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our proprietary position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies in that regard certain patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information 

security breaches including with respect to cybersecurity and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions as a leader in the field of genetic analysis we may face cyberattacks that attempt to penetrate our network security including our data centers sabotage or otherwise disable our research products and services misappropriate our or our customers and partners proprietary information which may include personally identifiable information or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services any such breach could 

 16 

compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and damage to our reputation 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government   regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may   be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

our products are not subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as our fdaregulated miseqdx certain of our products will become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable international agencies including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

molecular diagnostic products in particular depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable international agencies and may require either clearance from the fda following the 510k premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition if our products labeled as “research use only” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could be uncertain even if such use by our customers is without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

if the fda requires in the future that any of our ldt products be subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the clinical laboratory improvements amendments clia of 1988 these products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests” or ldts for a number of years the fda has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion to not regulate ldts as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory however the fda has been reconsidering its enforcement discretion policy and has commented that regulation of ldts may be warranted because of the growth in the volume and complexity of testing services utilizing ldts in october 2014 the fda published two draft guidance documents suggesting an approach for registration and listing of laboratories and assays along with a framework for regulation of ldts by the fda based on risk to patients rather than whether the ldts were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory the draft framework guidance includes premarket review for higherrisk ldts including many used to guide treatment decisions as well as companion diagnostics that have entered the market as ldts we cannot predict the nature or extent of the fdas final guidance or regulation of ldts in general or with respect to our ldts in particular if the fda requires in the future that ldt products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

if product or service liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us we may face reduced demand for our products and incur significant liabilities 

our products and services are used for sensitive applications and we face an inherent risk of exposure to product or service liability claims if our products or services are alleged to have caused harm resulted in false negatives or false positives or do not perform in accordance with specifications we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully defend any product or service liability lawsuit brought against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome product or service liability claims may result in 

  17 

 although we carry product and service liability insurance if we become the subject of a successful product or service liability lawsuit our insurance may not cover all substantial liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

as we develop market or sell diagnostic tests we may encounter delays in receipt or limits in the amount of reimbursement approvals and public health funding which will impact our ability to grow revenues in the healthcare market 

physicians and patients may not order diagnostic tests that we develop market or sell such as our verifi prenatal test unless thirdparty payors such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid and governmental payors outside of the united states pay a substantial portion of the test price thirdparty payors are often reluctant to reimburse healthcare providers for the use of medical tests that involve new technologies or provide novel diagnostic information in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly limiting reimbursement coverage for medical diagnostic products and in many instances are exerting pressure on diagnostic product suppliers to reduce their prices reimbursement by a payor may depend on a number of factors including a payors determination that tests using our technologies are 

 since each thirdparty payor often makes reimbursement decisions on an individual patient basis obtaining such approvals is a timeconsuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical data supporting the clinical benefits of each of our products as a result there can be no assurance that reimbursement approvals will be obtained this process can delay the broad market introduction of new products and could have a negative effect on our results of operations as a result thirdparty reimbursement may not be consistent or financially adequate to cover the cost of diagnostic products that we develop market or sell this could limit our ability to sell our products or cause us to reduce prices which would adversely affect our results of operations 

even if our tests are being reimbursed third party payors may withdraw their coverage policies cancel their contracts with our customers at any time review and adjust the rate of reimbursement require copayments from patients or stop paying for our tests which would reduce our revenues in addition insurers including managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid have increased their efforts to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services these measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization for the clinical laboratory industry reductions in the reimbursement rate of payors may occur in the future reductions in the prices at which our tests are reimbursed could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our   business 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe the asiapacific region and brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in singapore shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 49  50  and 51  of our total revenue for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

 18 

during 2014  a significant portion of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies while the majority of our purchases of raw materials were denominated in us dollars changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations recent global financial conditions have led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to the foregoing risks international operations entail the following risks 

 we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax laws or tax rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the us internal revenue service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company on its tax returns we could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if material payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

an inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our operations could adversely   affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business has grown rapidly with total revenues increasing from 735 million  for the year ended january 1 2006 to 186 billion  for the year ended december 28 2014  and with the number of employees increasing from 375 to more than 3700  during the same period we expect to continue to experience substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans the continued global expansion of our business and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our management and operational systems our ability to effectively manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a global basis if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement and improve our research product development manufacturing sales and marketing and customer support programs enhance our operational and financial control systems expand train and manage our employee base integrate acquired businesses and effectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 19 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be   able to sustain operating profitability 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the timing and availability of our customers’ funding the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final weeks of the quarter in light of that our revenue cutoff and recognition procedures together with our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter 

a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash sharebased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments   by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our   financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could   reduce demand for our products or services 

our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops other food sources and other living organisms the information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information including preimplantation genetic screening of embryos prenatal genetic testing genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions particularly for those that have no known cure governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 20 

our strategic investments may result in losses 

we periodically make strategic investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business the market values of these strategic investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control otherthantemporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses related to our investment this could result in future charges to our earnings it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any longterm benefits associated with these strategic investments 

conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses 

as of december 28 2014  we had 3200 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2016 6325 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2019 and 5175 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2021 outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of 8355  with respect to convertible notes due 2016 we believe that some noteholders will elect to convert the applicable notes upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 45 with respect to convertible notes due 2016 29 with respect to convertible notes due 2019 and 35 with respect to convertible notes due 2021 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include antitakeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us our certificate of incorporation has provisions that give our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 

in addition certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” including section 203 of the dgcl may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina section 203 of the dgcl provides with certain exceptions for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15 and less than 85 of the voting stock exclusive of stock held by directors officers and employee plans of a company 

the above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assesses on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable results could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates each matter presents its own unique circumstances and prior litigation does not necessarily provide a reliable basis on which to predict the outcome or range of outcomes in any individual proceeding because of the uncertainties related to the occurrence amount and range of loss on any pending litigation or claim we are currently unable to predict their ultimate outcome and with respect to any pending litigation or claim where no liability has been accrued to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in the event that opposing litigants in outstanding litigations or claims ultimately succeed at trial and any subsequent appeals on their claims any potential loss or charges in excess of any established accruals individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows in the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs or becomes probable and potentially in future periods

results of operations 

to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 28 2014  december 29 2013  and december 30 2012  stated as a percentage of total revenue 



our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 each of fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 were 52 weeks 

revenue 



 28 

product revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of consumables and instruments services and other revenue consists primarily of sequencing and genotyping service revenue as well as instrument service contract revenue revenues from businesses acquired in 2013 are predominantly recorded in service and other revenue 

2014  compared to 2013 

consumables revenue increased   1607 million  or 18  to 10410 million  in 2014  compared to 8803 million  in the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to sales of sequencing consumables driven by the growth in the installed base including hiseq x ten and nextseq platforms introduced in january 2014 such increase was partially offset by a decrease in array consumables   

instrument revenue increased   1907 million  or 51  to 5622 million  in 2014  compared to 3715 million  in the prior year driven primarily by shipments of sequencing instruments in particular hiseq x ten and nextseq platforms introduced in january 2014 

service and other revenue increased   853 million  or 55  to 2418 million  in 2014  compared to 1565 million  in the prior year driven primarily by sequencing services and extended service contracts for our instruments as our installed base continues to grow revenues from businesses acquired in 2013 are predominantly recorded in service revenue excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 the increase in service and other revenue was 35   

2013  compared to 2012 

consumables revenue increased   1510 million  or 21  to 8803 million  in 2013  compared to 7293 million  in the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of sequencing consumables driven by the growth in the installed base for both hiseq and miseq systems as well as higher consumable sales per hiseq instrument in the installed base 

instrument revenue increased   572 million  or 18  to 3715 million  in 2013  compared to 3143 million  in the prior year driven primarily by an increase in hiseq shipments 

  

the increase in service and other revenue in 2013  compared to prior year was driven by an increase in sequencing service volume and instrument service contract revenue as a result of our growing installed base excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 the increase in service and other revenue was 49   

gross margin 



2014  compared to 2013 

gross profit increased   3858 million  or 42  to 12977 million  in 2014  compared to 9119 million  in the prior year primarily due to the increase in revenue excluding gross profit from acquisitions completed in 2013 which was predominately included in gross profit from service sales the increase in gross profit was 37 also contributing to the increase in gross profit was our litigation settlement with syntrix in 2014 which resulted in reversal of cost of sales of 104 million see detailed discussions on this matter in note “10 legal proceedings” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in addition higher margins on sequencing instrument sales and efficiencies in manufacturing contributed to the increase in gross margin in 2013 gross margin was negatively affected by a 252 million impairment charge associated with the discontinuation of the eco and nupcr product lines 

2013  compared to 2012 

gross profit increased   1384 million  or 18  to 9119 million  compared to 7735 million  in the prior year primarily due to the increase in revenue excluding gross profit from acquisitions completed in 2013 which was predominately included in gross profit from services sales the increase in gross profit was 19 gross margin decreased in 2013 in comparison to the prior year primarily due to impairments associated with the discontinuation of the eco and nupcr product lines an increase in

amortization of acquired intangible assets due to recent acquisitions and an increase in legal contingencies which had an aggregate impact to gross margins of 39 acquisitions also contributed to the decrease in gross margin these decreases were partially offset by the favorable impacts from higher instrument margins higher mix of sequencing consumables and operational efficiencies 

operating expense 



2014  compared to 2013 

research and development expense increased  by 1113 million  or 40  in 2014  from 2013  the increase is partially attributable to our litigation settlement and patent pooling agreement with sequenom in 2014 as 488 million was recorded to research and development expense for the upfront payment see detailed discussion on this matter in note “10 legal proceedings” to our financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in addition headcount increases and other expenses related to our new product launches contributed to the increase in research and development expenses reflecting our continued investment in the development of new products as well as enhancements to existing products

in 2013 we recorded 136 million  of expenses incurred in relation to an unsolicited tender offer in q1 2012 the expenses consisted primarily of advisory and legal fees the advisory service arrangement was completed in 2013 

2013  compared to 2012 

research and development expense increased by 457 million  or 20  in 2013  from 2012  primarily due to increased headcount and consulting services as we continued to increase our investment in the development of new products as well as enhancements to existing products in 2012 we recorded a 214 million impairment charge for an inprocess research and development asset the lack of such charge in 2013 partially offset the increase in overall research and development expense 

 30 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased by 950 million  or 33  in 2013  from 2012  the increase is primarily driven by increased headcount and consulting services to support the growth of our company and our focus on global business process improvements as well as increased amortization of intangible assets 

acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2012 also contributed to the increases in research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense

other expense income net 



2014  compared to 2013 

interest income primarily consisted of returns from our investment portfolio interest income decreased  slightly in 2014  compared to 2013  as a result of lower yields partially offset by the impact from a larger investment portfolio interest expense in 2014  remained relatively consistent to 2013  and consisted primarily of accretion on our convertible senior notes 

  

costmethod investment related gain net  in 2014  consisted of a gain associated with additional proceeds received for a costmethod investment sold in a prior year in 2013 we recognized 614 million in gains from sales of costmethod investments of which 552 million related to the sale of our minority ownership interest in oxford nanopore technologies ltd

 31 

2013  compared to 2012 

interest income decreased in 2013 from 2012 as a result of a decrease in our investment portfolio balance as well as lower yields during the period furthermore interest income in 2012 included a 60 million recovery of a note receivable interest expense in 2013 remained relatively consistent as compared to 2012 and consisted primarily of accretion of discount on our convertible senior notes

provision for income taxes 



2014  compared to 2013 

our effective tax rate was 213  in 2014  and 2013 respectively the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as earnings in singapore and the united kingdom in addition the variance in 2014 was also attributable to the benefit from research and development credits and foreign tax credits and the variance in 2013 was also attributable to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit for 2012 which was enacted in january 2013 these items offset the impact of recording a valuation allowance which was primarily related to the estimated limitation on utilizing foreign tax credits in the us 

2013  compared to 2012 

our effective tax rate was 213  in 2013  as compared to 321  in 2012 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 in 2013 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory tax rate such as earnings in singapore and the united kingdom and the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit for 2012 which was enacted in january 2013 these items offset the impact of recording a valuation allowance which was primarily related to the estimated limitation on utilizing foreign tax credits in the us in 2012 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable to the change in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory rates 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which was signed into law on january 2 2013 included the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 30 2012 did not include the impact of the federal research credit generated in 2012 since the law was enacted subsequent to our 2012 reporting period instead the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research credit generated in 2012 reduced our provision for income taxes for 2013 by approximately 29 million 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 28 2014  we had approximately 6362 million  in cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 430 million  were held by our foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents decreased by 755 million  from last year due to the 

 32 

factors described in the “cash flow summary” below our primary source of liquidity other than our holdings of cash cash equivalents and investments has been cash flows from operations our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

historically we have liquidated our shortterm investments andor issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities as of december 28 2014  we have 7022 million  in shortterm investments shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 28 2014  were approximately 260 million  our shortterm investments include marketable securities consisting of us governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities 

in june 2014 we issued convertible senior notes due 2019 and 2021 2019 and 2021 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 11500 million the proceeds from such issuance and cash on hand totaling 12447 million  were used to repurchase 6000 million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes due 2016 2016 notes as of december 28 2014  3200 million  in principal amount of the 2016 notes remained outstanding with a maturity date of march 15 2016 the 2016 notes became convertible on april 1 2014 and continue to be convertible through march 31 2015 it is our intent and policy to settle conversions of the 2016 notes through combination settlement which essentially involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the principal amount and delivery of the excess of conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common stock the 2019 and 2021 notes were not convertible as of december 28 2014  

we anticipate that our current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash provided by operating activities are sufficient to fund our near term capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include 

 

as of december 28 2014  we had 441 million  in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with prior acquisitions to be settled in future periods 

during 2014 we used 2372 million  to repurchase our outstanding shares under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors as of december 28 2014  there remains 1304 million  under the authorized programs 

we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1 organization and significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing services and instrument service contracts the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgment and estimates 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met we occasionally offer discounts on newly introduced products to recent customers of existing products these promotions sometimes involve the tradein of existing products in exchange for a discount on new products where applicable we defer a portion of revenue on the sales of existing products in recognition of the promotional discounts until the delivery of new products all revenue is recorded net of discounts and sales taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities 

revenue from product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered typically evenly over the contract term revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether an arrangement is cancellable or subject to future changes in price deliverables or other terms if it is determined that the price is not fixed or determinable we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 

we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including products or services these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame approximately three to six months after the contract execution date revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of 

 36 

accounting determined to exist in the contract a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a standalone basis 

for transactions with multiple deliverables consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence exists we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 

in order to establish vsoe of selling price we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry we have rarely established selling price using thirdparty evidence if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

in certain markets we sell products and provides services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products in most sales through distributors the product is delivered directly to customers in cases where the product is delivered to a distributor revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor andor the enduser if required by the applicable sales contract the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers these transactions are accounted for in accordance with our revenue recognition policy described herein 

investments 

we invest in various types of securities including debt securities in governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities as of december 28 2014  we had 7022 million  in shortterm investments in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we classify our investments as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 

as discussed in note “5 fair value measurements” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level 2 these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly such as yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings and in the process we apply judgment and estimates that if changed could significantly affect our statement of financial positions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our gross trade accounts receivables totaled 2949 million  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was 55 million  at december 28 2014  our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

 37 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at lower of cost or market we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycles quality issues historical experience and usage forecasts our gross inventory totaled 2172 million  and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was 261 million  at december 28 2014  historically our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses however if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assess on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors which include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates resulting in a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the fair values assigned defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets net of liabilities assumed as goodwill these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

in connection with certain of our acquisitions additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones in these cases a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable inputs such as anticipated future cash flows riskfree adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related gain expense net a component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income this method requires significant management judgment including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 

management typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our longlived assets are impaired a review of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment if indicators of impairment exist we assess the recoverability of the affected longlived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts 

 38 

in order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows the time value of money and other factors that a willing market participant would consider significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our reporting unit we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

sharebased compensation 

we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

the determination of fair value of sharebased awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected life of an award expected dividends the riskfree interest rate and forecast of our future financial performance in the case of performance stock units we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards we update our forecast of future financial performance periodically which impacts our estimate of the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the outstanding performance stock units we amortize the fair value of sharebased compensation on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly sharebased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

warranties 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on instruments additionally we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve and adjust if necessary the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 

ceaseuse loss upon exit of facility 

we may from time to time relocate or consolidate our office locations and cease to use a facility for which the lease continues beyond the ceaseuse date we estimate ceaseuse loss as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period adjusted for deferred items and leasehold improvements in this process management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease including the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and the riskadjusted discount rate these assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates resulting in significant adjustments to the ceaseuse loss recorded 

 39 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates ofour future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies based on the available evidence as of december 28 2014  we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we recorded a valuation allowance of 152 million  against certain us deferred tax assets 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined

interest rate sensitivity 

our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments in addition if a 100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2015  our interest income would change by approximately 134 million  in relation to amounts we would expect to earn based on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 28 2014  

changes in interest rates may impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes in june 2014 we issued 6325 million  aggregate principal amount of 0  convertible senior notes due 2019 2019 notes and 5175 million  aggregate principal amount of 05  convertible senior notes due 2021 2021 notes similar to our 025 convertible senior notes due 2016 at our election the notes are convertible into cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price at 130 above the conversion price the notes will become convertible upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our thencurrent incremental borrowing rate if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted the implicit interest rates for the 2019 and 2021 notes were 29  and 35  respectively an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of 

 40 

1000 million aggregate principal amount of each of the 2019 and 2021 notes would result in losses of approximately 41 million  and 55 million  respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the company’s us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro yen and australian dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income we recorded a 54 million  net currency exchange loss for the fiscal year ended december 28 2014  on business transactions excluding hedging transactions which are included in other expense income net in our consolidated statements of income 

we use forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the gains or losses from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities as of december 28 2014  the total notional amount of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was 610 million

industry background 

genetics primer 

the instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna with the complete set of dna for any organism referred to as its genome dna contains small regions called genes which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively these nucleotide bases are present in a precise order known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a partial copy of its dna sequence  called messenger rna mrna  is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function the illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic 

 4 

variations among organisms are due in large part to differences in their dna sequences changes caused by insertions deletions inversions translocations or duplications of nucleotide bases may result in certain genes becoming overexpressed excessive protein production underexpressed reduced protein production or silenced altogether sometimes triggering changes in cellular function these changes can be the result of heredity but most often they occur at random the most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide polymorphism snp which is a variation in a single position of a nucleotide base in a dna sequence copy number variations cnvs occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes segments of a gene or stretches of dna 

in humans genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see eg height hair eye color etc more importantly these genetic variations can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease they can also impact an individual’s response to certain drug treatments causing them to respond well not respond at all or experience adverse side effects  an area of study known as pharmacogenomics 

scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans as well as a broad range of animals plants and microorganisms researchers investigating human viral and bacterial genetic variation are helping us to better understand the mechanisms of disease and thereby develop more effective therapeutics and diagnostics greater insight into genetic variation in plants eg food and biofuel crops and animals eg livestock and domestic animals is enabling scientists to improve crop yields and animal breeding programs 

the methods for studying genetic variation and biological function include sequencing snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression profiling and gene regulation and epigenetic analysis each of which is addressed by our breadth of products and services 

life sciences research primer 

life science research encompasses the study of all living things from humans animals and plants to viruses and bacteria it is being performed in government university pharmaceutical biotechnology and agrigenomics laboratories around the world where scientists are seeking to expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life beginning at the genetic level where our tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes life science research expands to include the study of the cells tissues organs systems and other components that make up living organisms this research supports development of new more effective clinical diagnostics and medicines to improve human health as well as advances in agriculture and animal husbandry to meet the world’s growing needs for food and energy 

molecular diagnostics primer 

molecular diagnostic assays or tests are designed to identify the biological indicators linked with disease and drug response providing physicians with information to more effectively diagnose treat and monitor both acute and chronic disease conditions they are an integral part of personalized healthcare where the unique makeup of each individual can be taken into account in diagnosing disease and managing treatment through the use of precision therapies biological indicators that can be measured by these assays include protein or gene expression methylation levels copy number variations and the presence or absence of a specific gene or group of genes 

 5 

there are molecular diagnostics assays in development and on the market including assays for infectious disease cancer and heart disease as well as molecularbased drug metabolism and response assays to help physicians understand a patient’s disease risk profile or to select the most effective therapy with the fewest side effects our innovative technologies and products are contributing to the development of a wide range of genomicbased molecular diagnostics assays including our own fdacleared miseqdx cystic fibrosis system which offers a complete solution for accurate comprehensive cystic fibrosis testing 

increased public knowledge about ancestral and genealogical information derived from genomic data and the clinical relevance of genetic markers has prompted consumer interest in having personal genomes analyzed sparking the development of the consumer genomics market several companies including illumina now offer personal sequencing or genotyping services working with physician groups and genetic counselors to interpret the results for consumers 

we believe the growth in consumer genomics and the use of genomicbased diagnostic assays will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and the economics of the pharmaceutical industry and health care by facilitating an increased emphasis on preventative and predictive molecular medicine ushering in the era of personalized healthcare 

our principal markets 

we believe that genomics will play an increasingly important role in molecular biology and that by empowering genetic analysis our tools will advance disease research drug development and the creation of molecular diagnostic tests in addition to developing sequencing and arraybased solutions for life science applied and consumer genomics markets we are facilitating the transition of sequencing to the clinic by supporting and carrying out clinical trials to gather data for regulatory submissions in the united states and globally and establishing infrastructure to offer products designed and manufactured in compliance with global quality standards for medical devices effective december 30 2013 we realigned our business to target the markets and customers outlined below on a more comprehensive basis 

life sciences 

historically our core business has been in the life sciences research market which consists of laboratories generally associated with universities medical research centers and government institutions as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions are using our products and services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities such as nextgeneration sequencing midtohighcomplexity genotyping and gene expression for wholegenome discovery and profiling and low complexity genotyping and gene expression for highthroughput targeted screening sequencing is growing the most rapidly among these three areas due to the improved performance of next generation sequencing technologies it is fueled by private and public funding new global initiatives to broadly characterize genetic variation and the migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencingbased technologies 

we also provide products and services for other life sciences applied markets such as the agricultural genomics market where government and corporate researchers use our sequencing and arraybased tools to accelerate and enhance agricultural research to help identify desirable traits in plants and animals leading to healthier and more productive crops and livestock 

reproductive and genetic health 

our technologies and products provide reproductive health solutions ranging from preimplantation genetic screening pgs preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd noninvasive prenatal testing nipt as well as neonatal and genetic health testing our pgs solutions are used in connection with invitro fertilizations ivf to determine before implantation whether an embryo has an abnormal number of chromosomes which is a major cause of ivf failure and miscarriages in ivf cases where there is a family history of disease or when one or both parents are carriers for certain genetic conditions our pgd solutions identify before implantation which embryos have genes associated with severe genetic disorders our nipt solutions provide noninvasive tests for early identification of fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing cellfree dna in maternal blood and our neonatal and carrier screening solutions provide early identification of genetic disorders in newborns as well as adults who are considering their reproductive options 

oncology 

cancer is a disease of the genome and the goal of cancer genomics is to identify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one understanding these genomic changes may lead to a more accurate diagnosis a better understanding of the prognosis and the selection of individually targeted therapies our sequencing and arraybased solutions provide researchers and clinicians in the research translational and clinical oncology markets with tools to identify the 

 6 

molecular changes in a tumor during all stages of tumor progression transform discoveries into new treatments or therapies for cancer patients and create diagnostic tests to identify patients most likely to be helped or harmed by a particular treatment or therapy 

enterprise informatics 

enterprise informatics solutions increase the utility of genomic data by providing tools that allow customers to analyze archive and share genomic data the integration of our instruments with data analysis software solutions allow customers to go from raw genomic data to meaningful results our basespace genomics analysis platform which can be hosted onsite or in a cloudbased system integrates directly with our sequencing instruments to streamline sequencingdata analysis facilitate data sharing provide data storage solutions and provide access to a growing number of data analysis applications 

in 2013 we acquired nextbio which provides a platform for aggregating and analyzing large quantities of genomic and phenotypic data for research and clinical applications ultimately we believe that largescale genomic databases containing both genomic and phenotypic information will enhance the value of human genome sequencing and accelerate the pace of discovery 

new and emerging markets 

our markets are characterized by rapid change and innovation brought about by next generation sequencing and new applications and opportunities appear and evolve quickly through our new and emerging market business unit we assess new opportunities against our corporate strategies and consider whether there is a compelling unmet need and the opportunity to transform the market with our products and services some of the markets that provide immediate and nearterm opportunities to expand the use of next generation sequencing include transplant diagnostics where sequencing is used to evaluate donor and patient compatibility forensic genomics where sequencing is used to investigate criminal cases consumer genomics where genotyping is primarily used to reveal ancestry and genealogical linkage information and population sequencing where sequencing is used to catalogue the complete spectrum of genetic variation in large populations 

our principal technologies

we have an extensive intellectual property portfolio including as of february 1 2014 ownership of or exclusive licenses to 402 issued us patents and 383 pending us patent applications including 22 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents our issued patents include those directed to various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments and chemical detection technologies and have terms that expire between 2014 and 2032 we continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies we have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries 

we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our trade secrets to enforce our patents copyrights and trademarks to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2014 and 2020 we have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect 

research and development 

we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled scientists and engineers who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize and support commercialization of the products and services derived from our technologies 

our research and development expenses for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  were 2767 million  2310 million  and 1969 million  respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2014  to support the growth of our business and as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts 

marketing and distribution 

our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments include many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and animal and agricultural research our potential customers include leading genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories hospitals reference laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics commercial molecular diagnostic and consumer genomics companies 

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe latin america and the asiapacific region in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in addition in certain markets within europe the asiapacific 

 10 

region latin america the middle east and south africa we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products we expect to continue to increase our sales and distribution resources during 2014  and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products 

manufacturing 

we manufacture sequencing and array platforms reagent kits and scanning equipment our manufacturing capacity for consumables and instruments has grown during 2013 to support increased customer demand we are exploring ways to increase the level of automation in the manufacturing process to continue to accelerate throughput and improve the quality and manufacturing yield as we increase the complexity of our products we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances our key manufacturing and distribution facilities operate under a quality management system certified to iso 13485 which demonstrates the organization’s ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements 

raw materials 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies we have multiple commercial sources for many of our components and supplies however there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from single source suppliers to mitigate potential risks arising from single source suppliers we believe that we can redesign our products for alternative components or use alternative reagents if required in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain 

competition 

although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect to continue to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets these include companies such as affymetrix inc agilent technologies inc bgi luminex corporation pacific biosciences of california inc qiagen nv roche holding ag and thermo fisher scientific inc among others some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over competing products 

segment and geographic information 

in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for segment reporting we have determined that we have one operating segment for purposes of recording and reporting our financial results 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 7065 million  or 50  of our total revenue during fiscal 2013  compared to 5801 million  or 51  and 5268 million  or 50  in fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively the us dollar has been determined to be the functional currency of the company’s international operations due to the primary economic environment of our foreign subsidiaries we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note “13 segment information geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately 330 million  and 260 million  at december 29 2013  and december 30 2012  respectively generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom 

 11 

we expect the majority of the backlog as of december 29 2013  to be shipped within the fiscal year ending december 28 2014  although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue even after title transfer depending on the specific arrangement with a customer and the applicable accounting treatment 

seasonality 

historically demand for our products is affected by a number of variables namely spending associated with the end of the us government fiscal year as well as the end of the calendar year and lower consumable utilization during the summer vacation months in europe during 2013 we saw sequential revenue growth due to demand for our innovative products and a slight benefit from calendar yearend spending 

  

environmental matters 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

government regulation 

as we continue to expand our product lines to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will be a significant factor in the development testing production and marketing of such products products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use will be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

the shorter 510k clearance process which we utilized for our fdacleared miseqdx instrument generally takes from three to six months after submission but it can take significantly longer the 510k submission process may be utilized if it is demonstrated that the new product is “substantially equivalent” to a similar product that has already been cleared by the fda the longer pma process which we intend to use for an ivd version of our hiseq 2500 system is much more costly uncertain and generally takes from nine months to one year after filing but it can take significantly longer because we cannot be certain that any molecular diagnostic products that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process or will ultimately be approved at all the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed and may be significantly more expensive than anticipated if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

in addition if our products labeled as “research use only” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could be uncertain even if such use by our customers is without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

employees 

as of december 29 2013  we had more than 3000  employees we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

if we do not successfully manage the development manufacturing and launch of new products or   services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely   affected 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested for instance in january 2014 we announced significant additions to our instrument platforms the hiseq x ten and the nextseq 500 which include dramatic technology advances if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle we may delay the product launch date in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions or transition requirements or programs such as tradein programs with respect to newly launched products or products in development relative to our existing products which could adversely affect sales of our existing products the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a widerange of competing technologies we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new   products 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on continuously developing and commercializing new products and services including improving our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to develop successfully and timely introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products there can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

 13 

 

we may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace 

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences diagnostic agricultural and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information for instance demand for our microarray products may be adversely affected if researchers fail to find meaningful correlations between genetic variation such as snps and disease susceptibility through genome wide association studies in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to sustain profitability 

reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics and consumer genomics companies and their capital spending budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services these budgets are based on a wide variety of factors including the allocation of available resources to make purchases funding from government sources the spending priorities among various types of research equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary periods any decrease in capital spending or change in spending priorities of our customers could significantly reduce our revenue moreover we have no control over the timing and amount of purchases by our customers and as a result revenue from these sources may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast any delay or reduction in purchases by our customers or our inability to forecast fluctuations in demand could harm our future operating results 

the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe in particular focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting uncertain economic growth funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable other programs such as defense entitlement programs or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities such as the us national institute of health or nih past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced nih and other research and development allocations any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 14 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we   may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or   technologies 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

if the quality of our products does not meet our customers’ expectations then our reputation could suffer and ultimately our   sales and operating earnings could be negatively   impacted 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products because our instruments and consumables are highly complex the occurrence of defects may increase as we continue to introduce new products and services and as we scale up manufacturing to meet increased demand for our products and services although we have established internal policies and procedures aligned to global quality standards to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities in addition identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and thirdparty components may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with for example shipment holds product recalls and warranty or other service obligations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 15 

litigation other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property   infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent   us from selling our products or services 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets or introduce new products we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products or services and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products or services in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins and earnings per share in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for some of our products or components and materials   used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are   delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the products components or materials supplied do   not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our   products in a timely manner or at all 

the complex nature of our products requires customized precisionmanufactured components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some components and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms in addition the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier the time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields any of which would negatively impact our operating results accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the products components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the democratic republic of the congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production or increase our costs any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop and maintain   operation of our manufacturing capability we may not be able to launch or support   our products in a timely manner or at all 

we continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments consumables and products 

 16 

that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

additionally we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and the san francisco bay area in california madison wisconsin and singapore these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products 

also many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional   personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our chief executive officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use sharebased compensation including restricted stock units and performance stock units to attract key personnel incentivize them to remain with us and align their interests with those of the company by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our   competitive position 

our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

the proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences genomics agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our proprietary position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued questions as to inventorship or ownership may also arise any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 

 17 

there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies in that regard certain patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information among other things we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants there can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements that we have with our employees collaborators and consultants will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and confidential information or will provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information accordingly there also can be no assurance that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government   regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may   be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

products are not subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as our fdacleared miseqdx certain of our products will become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable international agencies including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

molecular diagnostic products in particular depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable international agencies and may require either receiving clearance from the fda following a premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition if our products labeled as “research use only” or ruo are used or could be used for the diagnosis of disease the regulatory requirements related to marketing selling and supporting such products could be uncertain even if such use by our customers is without our consent if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

if product or service liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us we may face reduced demand for our products and incur significant liabilities 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product or service liability claims if our technologies or products are alleged to have caused harm or do not perform in accordance with specifications in part because our products are used for sensitive applications we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully defend any product or service liability lawsuit brought against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome product or service liability claims may result in 

 

although we carry product and service liability insurance if we become the subject of a successful product or service liability lawsuit our insurance may not cover all substantial liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 18 

as we develop market or sell diagnostic tests we may encounter delays in receipt or limits in the amount of reimbursement approvals and public health funding which will impact our ability to grow revenues in the healthcare market 

physicians and patients may not order diagnostic tests that we develop market or sell such as our verifi prenatal test unless thirdparty payors such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid and governmental payors outside of the united states pay a substantial portion of the test price thirdparty payors are often reluctant to reimburse healthcare providers for the use of medical tests that involve new technologies or provide novel diagnostic information in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly limiting reimbursement coverage for medical diagnostic products and in many instances are exerting pressure on diagnostic product suppliers to reduce their prices reimbursement by a payor may depend on a number of factors including a payors determination that tests using our technologies are 

 

since each thirdparty payor often makes reimbursement decisions on an individual patient basis obtaining such approvals is a timeconsuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical data supporting the clinical benefits of each of our products as a result there can be no assurance that reimbursement approvals will be obtained this process can delay the broad market introduction of new products and could have a negative effect on our results of operations as a result thirdparty reimbursement may not be consistent or financially adequate to cover the cost of diagnostic products that we develop market or sell this could limit our ability to sell our products or cause us to reduce prices which would adversely affect our results of operations 

even if we are being reimbursed for our tests third party payors may withdraw their coverage policies cancel their contracts with us at any time review and adjust the rate of reimbursement require copayments from patients or stop paying for our tests which would reduce our revenues in addition insurers including managed care organizations as well as government payors such as medicare and medicaid have increased their efforts to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services these measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization for the clinical laboratory industry reductions in the reimbursement rate of payors may occur in the future reductions in the prices at which our tests are reimbursed could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

billing complexities associated with obtaining payment or reimbursement for our diagnostic tests may negatively affect our revenues cash flow and profitability and we may incur additional financial risk related to collections and reimbursement in connection with the commercialization of our diagnostic tests   

billing for clinical laboratory testing services is complex and we have limited experience in billing and pursuing reimbursement and payment for diagnostic tests as a result of this lack of experience and uncertainty with respect to reimbursement we may also face an increased risk in our collection efforts including potential writeoffs of doubtful accounts and long collection cycles for accounts receivable related to our testing service which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition among the factors complicating our billing of thirdparty payors are 

 

these billing complexities and the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our tests could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations

doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our   business 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe the asiapacific region and brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in singapore during 2013  a significant portion of our sales to international customers were denominated in foreign currencies while the majority of our purchases of raw materials from international suppliers were denominated in us dollars shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 50  51  and 50  of our total revenue for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we intend to continue to expand our international presence by selling to customers located outside of the united states and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow 

international sales entail a variety of risks including 

 

changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations the recent global financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax laws or tax rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the us internal revenue service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company on its tax returns we could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if material payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

an inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our operations could adversely   affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business has grown rapidly with total revenues increasing from 735 million  for the year ended january 1 2006 to 142 billion  for the year ended december 29 2013  and with the number of employees increasing from 375 to more than 3000  during the same period we expect to continue to experience substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans the continued global expansion of our business and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our management and operational systems our ability to effectively manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to expend funds to 

 20 

enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a global basis if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement and improve our research product development manufacturing sales and marketing and customer support programs enhance our operational and financial control systems expand train and manage our employee base integrate acquired businesses and effectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be   able to sustain operating profitability 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the timing and availability of our customers’ funding the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final weeks of the quarter in light of that our revenue cutoff and recognition procedures together with our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter 

a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash sharebased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments   by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our   financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could   reduce demand for our products or services 

our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops and other living organisms the information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical 

 21 

legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information including preimplantation genetic screening of embryos prenatal genetic testing genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions particularly for those that have no known cure governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our strategic investments may result in losses 

we periodically make strategic investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business the market values of these strategic investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control otherthantemporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses related to our investment this could result in future charges to our earnings it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any longterm benefits associated with these strategic investments 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and damage to our reputation 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations 

as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers track customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results 

conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses 

as of december 29 2013  we had 920 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2016 outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of 8355  with respect to convertible notes due 2016 we expect that the noteholders will elect to convert the applicable notes upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 45  with respect to 

 22 

convertible notes due 2016 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include antitakeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us our certificate of incorporation has provisions that give our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 

in addition certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” including section 203 of the dgcl may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina section 203 of the dgcl provides with certain exceptions for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15 and less than 85 of the voting stock exclusive of stock held by directors officers and employee plans of a company 

the above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock

legal proceedings 

tableend 

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assess on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable results could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates each matter presents its own unique circumstances and prior litigation does not necessarily provide a reliable basis on which to predict the outcome or range of outcomes in any individual proceeding because of the uncertainties related to the occurrence amount and range of loss on any pending litigation or claim we are currently unable to predict their ultimate outcome and with respect to any pending litigation or claim where no liability has been accrued to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in the event that opposing litigants in outstanding litigations or claims ultimately succeed at trial and any subsequent appeals on their claims any potential loss or charges in excess of any established accruals individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows in the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs or becomes probable and potentially in future periods 

on november 24 2010 syntrix biosystems inc filed suit against us in the united states district court for the western district of washington at tacoma case no c105870bhs alleging that we willfully infringed us patent no 6951682 by selling our beadchip array products and that we misappropriated syntrix’s trade secrets in november and december 2012 we filed motions for summary judgment that the patent is not infringed and is invalid and that syntrix’s trade secrets claims are barred by various statutes of limitation syntrix filed a motion for summary judgment that the patent is valid on january 30 2013 the court granted our motion for summary judgment on syntrix’s trade secret claims and dismissed those claims from the case the court denied syntrix’s motion for summary judgment on validity and denied our motion for summary judgment for noninfringement and invalidity on march 14 2013 a jury reached a verdict in favor of syntrix finding that illumina’s beadchip kits infringe the syntrix patent during trial the court dismissed syntrix’s claim that the alleged infringement was willful on july 1 2013 the court entered a final amended judgment for 1151 million in accordance with the jury verdict including supplemental damages and prejudgment interest in addition the court awarded syntrix an ongoing royalty of 8 for accused sales from march 15 2013 until the patent expires on september 16 2019 on july 17 2013 we filed a posttrial motion asking the district court to vacate the amended judgment and enter judgment as a matter of law in our favor or alternatively to grant a new trial on november 4 2013 the court issued an order denying our motion for judgment as a matter of law and upholding the jury verdict 

we believe strongly that we did not infringe the syntrix patent and that the patent is invalid therefore we disagree with the judgment and contend that the judgment is not supported by the law or facts accordingly on december 3 2013 we filed a notice of appeal to the court of appeals for the federal circuit challenging the final amended judgment 

as a result of the amended judgment we have recorded a legal contingency accrual of 1329 million  as of december 29 2013  which includes the damages and prejudgment interest awarded to syntrix estimated additional damages through december 29 2013  and an estimate of interest accrued on the damages subsequent to june 19 2013 for the year ended december 29 2013  such charges totaled 1329 million  1146 million  of which was recorded within operating expenses and the remainder was recorded to cost of sales in december 2013 we secured the amount of the judgment by executing a supersedeas bond and deposited 120 million  of the accrued postjudgment ongoing royalty amounts with the court we will continue to deposit with the court ongoing royalties on future sales at the royalty rate stated in the final amended judgment during the appeal process funds deposited with the court are reported as restricted cash in other longterm assets

our financial results have been and will continue to be impacted by several significant trends which are described below while these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item 1 part i of this report and the other transactions events and trends discussed in “risk factors” in item 1a part i of this report 

funding environment 

  

while many of our customers receive funding from government agencies to purchase our products or services we are diversifying our customer base to include more customers that do not depend on government funding in 2013  approximately 45 of our total revenue came from customers who are not directly reliant on government agencies for funding we estimate that less than 30 of our total revenue in 2013  came from academic or government customers in the united states that directly or indirectly derive funding from the us national institute of health nih nih funding for the us fiscal year 2014 is set to increase more than 3 compared to the 2013 sequestration budget and we believe that allocations within the nih budget will continue to favor genetic analysis tools generally and in particular research programs that utilize nextgeneration sequencing 

nextgeneration sequencing   

nextgeneration sequencing has become a core technology for modern life science research and is increasingly being used in the applied molecular diagnostics and translational markets our sequencing instrument installed base continued to expand in 2013 and we believe that expansion of the sequencing market including an increase in the number of samples available and enhancements in our product portfolio will continue to drive demand for our nextgeneration sequencing technologies as a result we believe that our sequencing consumable revenue will continue to grow in future periods 

our portfolio of sequencing platforms represents a family of systems that are designed to meet the workflow output and accuracy demands of a full range of sequencing applications our miseq sequencing system is a lowcost desktop sequencing system that provides individual researchers with rapid turnaround time high accuracy and streamlined workflow nextseq 500 launched in january 2014 provides flexibility from whole genome sequencing to targeted panels in a desktop platform our hiseq 2500 sequencing system allows customers to sequence an entire human genome in approximately a day hiseq x ten announced in january 2014 is a set of ten ultrahighthroughput sequencers built for largescale human wholegenome sequencing with the ability to generate 18 terabases of dna sequence per sequencer in less than three days 

microarrays 

as a complement to nextgeneration sequencing we believe microarrays offer a less expensive faster and highly accurate technology for use when genetic content is already known the information content of microarrays is fixed and reproducible as such microarrays provide repeatable standardized assays for certain subsets of nucleotide bases within the overall genome we believe that life science researchers will migrate certain array studies to sequencing however we expect this decline to be offset by demand from customers in consumer reproductive health and applied markets additionally 

 28 

demand in the array market has trended toward microarrays that have largesample numbers at a lower complexity thus having a lower selling price per sample and we believe our innovation in microarray products supports the lower selling price 

financial overview 

financial highlights for 2013  include the following 

 in 2013 the internal revenue service began an audit of the corporate income tax return filed for fiscal year 2011 the internal revenue service continues to gather information and has not yet proposed any adjustments to the filed return

revenue 



product revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of consumables and instruments services and other revenue consists primarily of instrument service contract revenue as well as sequencing and genotyping service revenue 

 30 

2013  compared to 2012   

consumables revenue increased   1510 million  or 21  to 8803 million  in 2013  compared to 7293 million  in the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of sequencing consumables driven by the growth in the installed base for both hiseq and miseq systems as well as higher consumable sales per hiseq instrument in the installed base 

instrument revenue increased   572 million  or 18  to 3715 million  in 2013  compared to 3143 million  in the prior year driven primarily by an increase in hiseq shipments 

the increase in service and other revenue in 2013  compared to the prior year was driven by an increase in sequencing service volume and instrument service contract revenue as a result of our growing installed base 

2012  compared to 2011   

consumables revenue increased   1335 million  or 22  to 7293 million  in 2012 compared to 5958 million  in 2011 the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of sequencing consumables driven by higher consumable sales per hiseq instrument and the growth in both the hiseq and miseq installed base 

instrument revenue decreased   588 million  or 16  to 3143 million  in 2012  compared to 3731 million  in 2011 driven by a decrease in hiseq shipments partially offset by a full year of miseq shipments in 2012  as compared to less than two quarters of shipments in 2011 

revenue in 2011 reflects the impact of discounts provided to customers under our genome analyzer tradein program the estimated incremental sales incentive provided under this tradein program was approximately 111 million based on the total discount provided from list price in excess of our average discount on hiseq 2000 sales during the period the genome analyzer tradein program was completed in q4 2011 see “revenue recognition” in note “1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on the genome analyzer tradein program 

  

the increase in service and other revenue in 2012  compared to 2011 was driven by an increase in our instrument service contract revenue as a result of our growing installed base as well as an increase in our genotyping and sequencing service revenue 

gross margin 



2013  compared to 2012     

gross profit in 2013   increased  in comparison to the prior year primarily due to the increase in revenue gross margin decreased in 2013 in comparison to the prior year primarily due to impairments associated with the discontinuation of the eco and nupcr product lines an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets due to recent acquisitions and an increase in legal contingencies which had an aggregate impact to gross margins of 39 acquisitions also contributed to the decrease in gross margin these decreases were partially offset by the favorable impacts from higher instrument margins higher mix of sequencing consumables and operational efficiencies 

2012  compared to 2011   

gross profit in 2012  increased in comparison to 2011  primarily due to higher sales gross margin improved in 2012 due in large part to the shift in sales mix from instruments to consumables which have a higher margin than instruments this improvement was partially offset by a legal settlement charge recorded to cost of sales in 2012 in addition instrument sales in 2011 were affected by promotional discounts provided to customers on hiseq 2000 sales including the genome analyzer 

 31 

tradein program based on the estimated amount of incremental sales incentive provided the genome analyzer tradein program negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 11 in 2011 this tradein program was completed in q4 2011 

operating expense 



2013  compared to 2012    

research and development expense increased  by 457 million  or 20  in 2013  from 2012  primarily due to increased headcount and consulting services as we continue to increase our investment in the development of new products as well as enhancements to existing products in 2012 we recorded a 214 million impairment charge for an inprocess research and development asset the lack of such charge in 2013 partially offset the increase in overall research and development expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased  by 950 million  or 33  in 2013  from 2012  the increase is primarily driven by increased headcount and consulting services to support the growth of our company and our focus on global business process improvements as well as increased amortization of intangible assets 

recently completed acquisitions also contributed to the increases in research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense 

during 2013  we recorded 1154 million  in legal contingency charges within operating expenses primarily related to the syntrix litigation matter the amount recorded in operating expenses included the damages and prejudgment interest awarded to syntrix through march 14 2013 the jury verdict date see additional discussions on this matter in note “10 legal proceedings” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k  

during 2013  we recorded 136 million  of expenses incurred in relation to an unsolicited tender offer in q1 2012 the expenses consisted primarily of advisory and legal fees the advisory related expenses decreased from the prior year as the advisory service arrangements were completed 

acquisition related gain expense net in 2013  primarily consisted of gains from changes in fair value of contingent consideration of 188 million  such gains were partially offset by transaction and other acquisition related costs of 72 million acquisition related gain expense net in the prior year consisted of changes in fair value of contingent consideration of 20 million and transaction costs of 08 million 

we completed the relocation of our headquarters in 2012 during 2013  we recorded additional ceaseuse loss due to a delay in the sublease of portions of our prior headquarters and accretion of interest expense related to the facility exit obligation recorded upon vacating our former headquarters headquarter relocation expense recorded in 2012  consisted of ceaseuse loss recorded upon vacating our prior headquarters accretion expense related to the facility exit obligation double rent expense during the transition to our new facility and moving expenses 

in late 2011 we announced restructuring plans to reduce our global workforce and to consolidate certain facilities as a result of the restructuring effort we recorded additional restructuring charges of 35 million  during 2012  comprised primarily of severance pay and other employee separation costs restructuring activities were completed during 2012 

 32 

2012  compared to 2011   

research and development expense increased by 341 million  or 17  in 2012  from 2011  primarily due to a 214 million  impairment loss recognized for iprd recorded as a result of a prior acquisition and increased personnel expenses as we continue to increase our investment in projects to develop and commercialize new products in addition we incurred increased facilities expenses in 2012 as the rental fees for our current headquarters are higher than our prior facility 

selling general and administrative expense increased by 241 million  in 2012  from 2011  the increase is primarily driven by a 158 million increase in personnel expenses associated with increased headcount and a 95 million increase in legal and other consulting fees personnel expenses included salaries sharebased compensation and benefits these increases in expense were partially offset by a 23 million decrease in bad debt expense as certain customer bankruptcies impacted us in 2011 in addition we had the benefit of a 23 million legal settlement gain recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in 2011 

during q1 2012 ckh acquisition corporation and roche holding ltd together “roche” made an unsolicited tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of our common stock for up to 5100 per share during 2012 we recorded 231 million  of expenses incurred in relation to roche’s unsolicited tender offer consisting primarily of legal advisory and other professional fees

provision for income taxes 



2013  compared to 2012 

our effective tax rate was 213  in 2013  as compared to 321  in 2012 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 in 2013 was primarily attributable to a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory tax rate and the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit for 2012 which was enacted in january 2013 these items offset the impact of recording a valuation allowance which was primarily related to the estimated limitation on utilizing foreign tax credits in the us in 2012 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable to the change in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory rates 

  

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which was signed into law on january 2 2013 included the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 30 2012 did not include the impact of the federal research credit generated in 2012 since the law was enacted subsequent to our 2012 reporting period instead the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research credit generated in 2012 reduced our provision for income taxes for 2013 by approximately 29 million 

  

2012  compared to 2011   

our effective tax rate was 321  for 2012 the variance from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 was primarily attributable to the change in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory rates the effective tax rate in 2011 was 349 which closely approximated the us federal statutory tax rate because a significant portion of our earnings were subject to us taxation

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 29 2013  we had approximately 7116 million  in cash and cash equivalents a 2777 million  increase from last year due to the factors described in the “cash flow summary” below our primary source of liquidity other than our holdings of cash cash equivalents and investments has been cash flows from operations our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries at december 29 2013  were approximately 4126 million  it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

historically we have liquidated our shortterm investments andor issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities at december 29 2013  we have 4540 million  in shortterm investments our shortterm investments include marketable securities consisting of debt securities in governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury notes 

we anticipate that our current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our near term capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include expenditures related to 

 

as of december 29 2013  296 million  principal amount of our 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 remained outstanding with a maturity date of february 15 2014  9200 million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes due 2016 “2016 notes” remained outstanding as of december 29 2013  the 2016 notes are convertible into cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock prior to maturity if the trading price of our common stock remains at least 130 above 8355 for a sustained period it is our intent and policy to settle conversions of the 2016 notes through combination settlement which essentially involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the principal amount and delivery of the excess of conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common stock 

as of december 29 2013  we have 495 million  in fair value of contingent considerations associated with prior acquisitions to be settled in future periods 

our board of directors authorized several common stock repurchase programs in 2013 we used 500 million  to repurchase our outstanding shares under these programs as of december 29 2013  we had authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional 1175 million  of our common stock on january 30 2014 our board of directors authorized an additional 2500 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on a discretionary basis in july 2013 the company settled with a hedging counterparty outstanding warrants to purchase approximately 30 million shares of the company’s common stock for 1250 million in cash 

we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1 organization and significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing services and instrument service contracts the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgment and estimates 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met all revenue is recorded net of discounts 

revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered typically evenly over the contract term revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether refund rights exist if there are refund rights or payment terms based on future performance we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 

we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including products or services these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame approximately three to six months of the contract execution date revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a standalone basis 

 38 

for transactions with multiple deliverables consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence exists we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 

in order to establish vsoe of selling price we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry we have rarely established selling price using thirdparty evidence if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

in certain markets the company sells products and provides services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products in most sales through distributors the product is delivered directly to customers in cases where the product is delivered to a distributor revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor andor the enduser if required by the applicable sales contract the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers these transactions are accounted for in accordance with the company’s revenue recognition policy described herein 

investments 

we invest in various types of securities including debt securities in governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities as of december 29 2013  we have 4540 million  in shortterm investments in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we classify our investments as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 

as discussed in note “5 fair value measurements” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level 2 these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly such as yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings and in the process we apply judgment and estimates that if changed could significantly affect our statement of financial positions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our gross trade accounts receivables totaled 2426 million  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was 37 million  at december 29 2013  our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

 39 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at lower of cost or market we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycles quality issues historical experience and usage forecasts our gross inventory totaled 1720 million  and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was 179 million  at december 29 2013  historically our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses however if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assess on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors which include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates resulting in a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the fair values assigned defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets net of liabilities assumed as goodwill these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

in connection with certain of our acquisitions additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones in these cases a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable inputs such as anticipated future cash flows riskfree adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related gain expense net a component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income this method requires significant management judgment including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 

management typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our longlived assets are impaired a review of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment if indicators of impairment exist we assess the recoverability of the affected longlived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts 

 40 

in order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows the time value of money and other factors that a willing market participant would consider significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our reporting unit we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

sharebased compensation 

we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

the determination of fair value of sharebased awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected life of an award expected dividends and the riskfree interest rate we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards we amortize the fair value of sharebased compensation on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly sharebased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

warranties 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on instruments additionally we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve and adjust if necessary the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 

ceaseuse loss upon exit of facility 

we may from time to time relocate or consolidate our office locations and cease to use a facility for which the lease continues beyond the ceaseuse date we estimate ceaseuse loss as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period adjusted for deferred items and leasehold improvements in this process management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease including the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and the riskadjusted discount rate these assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates resulting in significant adjustments to the ceaseuse loss recorded 

 41 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of the company’s future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies based on the available evidence as of december 29 2013  we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we recorded a valuation allowance of 191 million  against certain us deferred tax assets 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company’s return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined

interest rate sensitivity 

our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments in addition if a 100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2014  our interest income would change by approximately 117 million  in relation to amounts we would expect to earn based on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 29 2013  

changes in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes   during 2011 we issued 920 million  in aggregate principal amount of our 025  convertible senior notes due 2016 at our election the notes are convertible into cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in each case under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price for a sustained period at 130 above the conversion price of 8355  the notes will become convertible upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our thencurrent incremental borrowing rate if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted the implicit interest rate for the notes is 45  an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of 100 million aggregate principal amount of the notes would result in a loss of approximately 22 million

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the company’s us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro yen british pound sterling australian dollar and singapore dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income we recorded a 43 million  net currency exchange loss for the fiscal year ended december 29 2013  on business transactions excluding hedging transactions which are included in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income 

we use forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the gains or losses from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities as of december 29 2013  the total notional amount of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was 547 million

industry background 

genetics primer 

the instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna with the complete set of dna for any organism referred to as its genome dna contains small regions called genes which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively these nucleotide bases are present in a precise order known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a partial copy of its dna sequence  called messenger rna mrna  is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function the illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic 

variations among organisms are due in large part to differences in their dna sequences changes caused by insertions deletions inversions or duplications of nucleotide bases may result in certain genes becoming overexpressed excessive protein production underexpressed reduced protein production or silenced altogether sometimes triggering changes in cellular function these changes can be the result of heredity but most often they occur at random the most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide polymorphism snp which is a variation in a single position of a nucleotide base in a dna sequence copy number variations cnvs occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes segments of a gene or stretches of dna 

in humans genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see eg height hair eye color etc more importantly these genetic variations can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease they can also impact an individual’s response to certain drug treatments causing them to respond well not respond at all or experience adverse side effects  an area of study known as pharmacogenomics 

scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans as well as a broad range of animals plants and microorganisms researchers investigating human viral and bacterial genetic variation are helping us to better understand the mechanisms of disease and thereby develop more effective therapeutics and diagnostics greater insight into genetic variation in plants eg food and biofuel crops and animals eg livestock and domestic animals is enabling scientists to improve crop yields and animal breeding programs 

the methods for studying genetic variation and biological function include sequencing snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression profiling and gene regulation and epigenetic analysis each of which is addressed by our breadth of products and services 

life sciences research primer 

life science research encompasses the study of all living things from humans animals and plants to viruses and bacteria it is being performed in government university pharmaceutical biotechnology and agrigenomics laboratories around the world where scientists are seeking to expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life beginning at the genetic level where our tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes life science research expands to include the study of the cells tissues organs systems and other components that make up living organisms this research supports development of new more effective clinical diagnostics and medicines to improve human health as well as advances in agriculture and animal husbandry to meet the world’s growing needs for food and energy 

molecular diagnostics primer 

molecular diagnostic assays or tests are designed to identify the biological indicators linked with disease and drug response providing physicians with information to more effectively diagnose treat and monitor both acute and chronic disease conditions they are an integral part of personalized healthcare where the unique makeup of each individual can be taken into account in diagnosing disease and managing treatment through the use of more tailored therapies biological indicators that can be measured by these assays include protein or gene expression methylation levels copy number variations and the presence or absence of a specific gene or group of genes 

there are molecular diagnostics assays on the market including assays for infectious disease cancer and heart disease as well as molecularbased drug metabolism and response assays to help physicians select the most effective therapy with the fewest side effects our innovative technologies and products are contributing to the development of a wide range of potential genomicbased molecular diagnostics assays 

growing news coverage about the clinical relevance of newly discovered genetic markers has prompted consumer interest in having personal genomes analyzed sparking the development of the consumer genomics market we believe there are distinct medical benefits especially for people with family histories of certain diseases of knowing potential disease predispositions several companies including illumina now offer personal sequencing or genotyping services working with physician groups and genetic counselors to interpret the results for consumers 

we believe the growth in consumer genomics and the use of genomicbased diagnostic assays will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and the economics of the pharmaceutical industry and health care by facilitating an increased emphasis on preventative and predictive molecular medicine ushering in the era of personalized medicine 

our principal markets 

from the company’s inception we have believed that the analysis of genetic variation and function will play an increasingly important role in molecular biology and that by empowering genetic analysis our tools will advance disease research drug development and the creation of molecular diagnostic tests in addition to developing sequencing and arraybased solutions for life science applied and consumer genomics markets we are facilitating the transition of sequencing to the clinic by supporting and carrying out clinical trials to gather data for regulatory submissions in the us and globally and establishing infrastructure to offer products designed and manufactured in compliance with global quality standards for medical devices 

life sciences research market 

our core business is in the life sciences research market which consists of laboratories generally associated with universities medical research centers and government institutions as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions are using our products and services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities such as nextgeneration sequencing midtohighcomplexity genotyping and gene expression for wholegenome discovery and profiling and low complexity genotyping and gene expression for highthroughput targeted screening dna sequencing is growing the most rapidly among these three areas due to the creation of next generation sequencing technologies it is fueled by private and public funding new global initiatives to broadly characterize genetic variation and the migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencingbased technologies 

applied markets 

we provide products and services for various other markets which we refer to as “applied markets” the largest among these is the agricultural market where government and corporate researchers use our sequencing and arraybased tools to accelerate and enhance agricultural research for example we currently offer microarrays that contain snps for custom and focused genotyping of seeds and crops such as maize tomatoes apples and potatoes livestock such as cattle horses pigs goats and sheep and companion animals such as dogs customers use these tools to perform selective breeding through highvalue trait screening methods thereby accelerating and enhancing the process as compared to traditional methods such as crossbreeding we have developed a highgrowth recurring revenue business in both the livestock and agricultural segments and emerging opportunities in the applied markets include forensics and pet genomics 

molecular diagnostics market 

molecular diagnostics is the fastest growing segment of the diagnostics market at present this growth is largely driven by infectious disease testing but molecular diagnostics is rapidly expanding into new areas such as reproductive health including noninvasive prenatal testing and cancer management  both are areas of focus for our diagnostics business the increasing efficacy of molecular diagnostics is driven by the continued discovery of genetic markers with proven clinical utility the increasing adoption of geneticbased diagnostic tests and the expansion of reimbursement programs to include a greater number of approved molecular diagnostic tests we believe our sequencing and array instrument platforms are foundational to continued growth in this market 

in september 2012 we acquired bluegnome a leading provider of solutions for screening genetic abnormalities associated with developmental delay cancer and infertility the combination of bluegnome’s solutions with our microarray 

and sequencing platforms will enable the development of nextgeneration tools for these markets in january 2013 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire verinata health inc upon completion of the verinata acquisition our focus on reproductive health will be further strengthened by having access to verinata’s verifi® prenatal test the broadest noninvasive prenatal test nipt available today for highrisk pregnancies and what we believe to be the most comprehensive intellectual property portfolio in the nipt industry 

in december 2012 we submitted a 510k application for a version of our miseq system the miseqdx to the us food and drug administration or fda for marketing as a cleared device for use with in vitro diagnostic ivd products in connection with our fda submission of the miseqdx system we submitted two cystic fibrosis cf assays  a diagnostic assay and a carrier screening assay  to the fda that if cleared would be sold as ivd kits to be run on the miseqdx system the miseqdx cystic fibrosis diagnostic assay is designed for simultaneous detection of all mutations and variants within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr gene the test is intended to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals with suspected cf or congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens cbavd results of this test are intended to be interpreted by a certified clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent the miseqdx cystic fibrosis carrier screening assay is designed for simultaneous detection of clinically relevant variants within the cftr gene including those currently recommended for carrier screening purposes by the american college of medical genetics acmg and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog the test is intended to be used in general population screening to determine cf carrier status as an aid in newborn screening for cf and as an initial genetic test to aid in the diagnosis of individuals with suspected cf or cbavd 

as the molecular diagnostics market continues to evolve and emerge we believe the translational market will prove to be another growth opportunity for us in september 2012 illumina introduced trusight content sets for use by laboratories with nextgeneration sequencing systems such as the miseq comprised of oligonucleotide probes targeting genes and gene regions thought to be relevant for specific genetic diseases or conditions truseq content sets are designed for use by laboratories in the development of their own unique targeted sequencing tests 

consumer genomics markets 

new sequencing and genotyping technologies such as those developed by illumina are driving down the cost of performing comprehensive sequencing and genotyping analyses rapidly paving the way to improving diagnosing of diseases and evaluation of disease risk consumer genomics is a nascent market but one we believe has the potential for high growth as the cost per analysis continues to drop in 2009 we launched our individual genome sequencing service the first physicianintermediated personal genome sequencing service for consumers built around physicianpatient consultation the service requires a physician’s order to initiate the process with genome sequencing performed using our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory 

our principal technologies 

our unique technology platforms enable the scale of experimentation necessary for genomewide discovery target selection and validation studies see figure 1 below more than 8000 customerauthored scientific papers have been published to date using these technologies representing the efforts of a large and dynamic illumina user community through rapid innovation we are changing the economics of genetic research enabling projects that were previously considered unapproachable 

figure 1 illumina platform overview   

sequencing technology 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases a c g or t in a dna sample our hiseq 25002000 hiseq 15001000 genome analyzer iix miseq and hiscansq systems represent a family of systems that we believe are setting the standard for productivity costeffectiveness and accuracy among nextgeneration sequencing technologies they are used by customers to perform wholegenome de novo and targeted resequencing of genomes and to analyze specific gene regions and genes 

wholegenome sequencing determines an organism’s complete dna sequence in de novo sequencing the goal is to sequence a representative sample from a species never before sequenced in targeted resequencing a sequence of nucleotide bases is compared to a standard or reference sequence from a previously sequenced species to identify changes that reflect genetic variation understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between and within species furthers our understanding of the function of the structures encoded in the dna 

our dna sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminatorbased sequencing chemistry referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry our sbs sequencing technology provides researchers with a broad range of applications and the ability to sequence even large mammalian genomes in days rather than weeks or years our highest throughput sequencing instrument the hiseq 2500 has the ability to generate up to 600 gigabases gb five human genomes of dna sequence in ten days or up to 120 gb in approximately one day in rapid run mode since the launch of our first sequencing system in 2007 our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a factor of 100 

beadarray technology 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously enabling largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique highthroughput cost effective and flexible manner the arrays manufactured using beadarray technology are imaged by our iscan hiscan and hiscansq systems for a broad range of dna and rna analysis applications including snp discovery snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression analysis and methylation analysis 

our proprietary beadarray technology consists of microscopic silica beads with each bead covered with hundreds of thousands of copies of oligonucleotides or oligos that act as the capture sequences in one of our assays we deploy our beadarray technology on beadchips  silicon wafers the size of a microscope slide with varying numbers of sample sites per slide beadchips are chemically etched to create tens of millions of wells for each sample site 

using our beadarray technology we achieve highthroughput analysis with a high density of test sites per array and are able to format arrays in various configurations we seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive consumables and valuable samples and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments these features enable our beadarray technology to be applied to highgrowth markets of snp genotyping and cnv analysis and have allowed us to be a key player in the gene expression market 

eco realtime pcr technology 

in 2010 we purchased helixis and its novel realtime pcr technology and introduced the eco realtime pcr system to the market realtime pcr also known as quantitative pcr or qpcr is used to amplify and simultaneously quantify a targeted dna molecule with applications in gene expression viral quantification array data validation pathogen detection and genotyping the procedure follows the same steps as pcr whereby thermal cycling alternately heating and cooling the dna sample from 20 to 40 times causes the dna to selfreplicate resulting in the doubling of dna product with each cycle realtime pcr uses various fluorescent detection chemistries to enable the monitoring of the pcr reaction as it progresses data are collected at each cycle rather than at the end of the reaction providing higher precision increased sensitivity increased dynamic range and higher resolution 

the eco system combines a proprietary thermal system fourcolor multiplex capabilities and a finetuned optical system to deliver accurate qpcr results its unique design provides superior thermal uniformity supporting highquality pcr performance for demanding applications such as high resolution melt hrm curve analysis used for snp genotyping dna fingerprinting species identification hla compatibility typing allelic prevalence and dna methylation analysis measuring just over one cubic foot in size we believe the eco system’s overall performance rivals larger more expensive systems

since june 2009 illuminas clinical services laboratory has been offering the individual genome sequencing service providing personal genome sequencing from our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory using illumina nextgeneration sequencing technology we offer a variety of reporting options the individual genome sequencing service requires individuals to follow our physicianmediated process which involves preservice consultation and informed consent that includes review of the information potentially to be learned in the report the final genome data is returned to the physician who then meets with the patient and discusses implications and possible actions based on the results if the physician and patient agree the information can also be downloaded to the individuals personal ipad® for additional exploration we are collaborating with a number of partners to provide additional evaluations such as ancestry and information on traits of interest 

intellectual property 

we have an extensive intellectual property portfolio including as of february 1 2013 ownership of or exclusive licenses to 270 issued us patents and 172 pending us patent applications including 11 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents our issued patents include those directed to various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments and chemical detection technologies and have terms that expire between 2013 and 2030 we continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies we have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries 

we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our trade secrets to enforce our patents copyrights and trademarks to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment we have exclusive licenses from tufts university to patents that are directed to our beadarray technology these patents were filed by dr david walt who is a member of our board of directors the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2013 and 2020 we have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third 

parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect 

research and development 

we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled scientists and engineers who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize and support commercialization of the products and services derived from our technologies 

our research and development expenses for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  were 2310 million  1969 million  and 1779 million  respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2013  as a result of the growth of our business and as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts 

marketing and distribution 

our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and animal and agricultural research our potential customers include leading genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics and consumer genomics companies the genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will ultimately be driven by among other items 

 

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe latin america and the asiapacific region in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in addition in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region latin america the middle east and south africa we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products likewise in the united states we sell our qpcr portfolio including the eco realtime pcr system and associated reagents through a distributor we expect to continue to increase our sales and distribution resources during 2013  and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products 

manufacturing 

we manufacture sequencing and array platforms reagent kits scanning equipment and oligos our manufacturing capacity for consumables and instruments has grown during 2012 to support increased customer demand to continue to increase throughput and improve the quality and manufacturing yield as we increase the complexity of our products we are exploring ways to continue increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances 

raw materials 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies we have multiple commercial sources for many of our components and supplies however there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from single source suppliers to mitigate potential risks arising from single source suppliers we believe that we can redesign our products for alternative components or 

use alternative reagents if required in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain 

competition 

although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect to continue to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets these include companies such as affymetrix inc agilent technologies inc complete genomics inc general electric company life technologies corporation luminex corporation pacific biosciences of california inc qiagen nv and roche diagnostics corp among others some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over competing products 

segment and geographic information 

in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for segment reporting we have determined that we have two operating segments for purposes of recording and reporting our financial results life sciences and diagnostics our life sciences operating segment includes all products and services related to the research market namely the product lines based on our sequencing array and realtime pcr technologies our diagnostics operating segment focuses on the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics during all periods presented our diagnostics operating segment had limited activity accordingly our financial results for both operating segments are reported on an aggregate basis as one reportable segment we will begin reporting in two operating segments once revenues operating profit or loss or assets of the diagnostics operating segment exceed 10 of the consolidated amounts 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 5801 million  or 51  of our total revenue during fiscal 2012  compared to 5268 million  or 50  and 4038 million  or 45  in fiscal 2011  and 2010  respectively the us dollar has been determined to be the functional currency of the company’s international operations due to the primary economic environment of our foreign subsidiaries we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note “15 segment information geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately 260 million  and 251 million  at december 30 2012  and january 1 2012  respectively generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom we expect the majority of the backlog as of december 30 2012  to be shipped within the fiscal year ending december 29 2013  although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue even after title transfer depending on the specific arrangement with a customer and the applicable accounting treatment 

seasonality 

historically demand for our products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as a result in part of us academic customers spending unused budget allocations before the end of the us government’s fiscal year on september 30 of each year however this historical pattern has decreased during the past two years as a result in part of uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding and reduced usage of our consumable products during the summer vacation season 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

government regulation 

as we continue to expand our product lines to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as molecular diagnostic products regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will be a significant factor in the development testing production and marketing of such products products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use will be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

the shorter 510k clearance process which generally takes from three to six months after submission but can take significantly longer may be utilized if it is demonstrated that the new product is “substantially equivalent” to a similar product that has already been cleared by the fda the longer pma process is much more costly uncertain and generally takes from nine months to two years after filing because we cannot be certain that any molecular diagnostic products that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process or will ultimately be approved at all the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed and may be significantly more expensive than anticipated if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

in addition the regulatory approval or clearance process required to design manufacture market sell and support our existing and future products that are intended for and marketed and labeled as “research use only” or ruo is uncertain if such products are used or could be used even without our consent for the diagnosis of disease if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

employees 

as of december 30 2012  we had a total of approximately 2400  employees we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics and consumer genomics companies and their capital spending budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services these budgets are based on a wide variety of factors including the allocation of available resources to make purchases funding from government sources the spending priorities among various types of research equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary periods any decrease in capital spending or change in spending priorities of our customers could significantly reduce our revenue moreover we have no control over the timing and amount of 

purchases by our customers and as a result revenue from these sources may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast any delay or reduction in purchases by our customers or our inability to forecast fluctuations in demand could harm our future operating results 

the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe in particular focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting slowing economic growth funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable other programs such as defense entitlement programs or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities such as the us national institute of health or nih for instance the significance and timing of anticipated reductions to the nih budget from march 2013 may be significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of the budget control act of 2011 and whether these provisions remain in effect past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced nih and other research and development allocations any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a widerange of competing technologies we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we   may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or   technologies 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 15 

 

in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences diagnostic agricultural and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information for instance demand for our microarray products may be adversely affected if researchers fail to find meaningful correlations between genetic variation such as snps and disease susceptibility through genome wide association studies in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to sustain profitability 

if the quality of our products does not meet our customers’ expectations then our reputation could suffer and ultimately our   sales and operating earnings could be negatively   impacted 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products because our instruments and consumables are highly complex the occurrence of defects may increase as we continue to introduce new products and services and as we scale up manufacturing to meet increased demand for our products and services although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities in addition identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and thirdparty components may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with for example shipment holds product recalls and warranty or other service obligations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new   products 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on continuously developing and commercializing new products and services including improving 

our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to develop successfully and timely introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products there can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

 

we may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace 

if we do not successfully manage the development manufacturing and launch of new products or   services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely   affected 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle we may delay the product launch date in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions or transition requirements or programs such as tradein programs with respect to newly launched products or products in development relative to our existing products which could adversely affect sales of our existing products the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for components and materials   used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are   delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the components or materials supplied do   not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our   products in a timely manner or at all 

the complex nature of our products requires customized precisionmanufactured components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some components and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms in addition the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier the time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields any of which would negatively impact our operating results accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially 

reasonable costs or at all in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the democratic republic of the congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production or increase our costs any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional   personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use stock options and restricted stock units to attract key personnel incentivize them to remain with us and align their interests with those of the company by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop and maintain   operation of our manufacturing capability we may not be able to launch or support   our products in a timely manner or at all 

we continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments consumables and products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

additionally we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and hayward california madison wisconsin singapore and cambridge united kingdom these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products 

also many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our   competitive position 

our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and 

many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

the proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences genomics agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our proprietary position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued questions as to inventorship or ownership may also arise any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies in that regard certain patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information among other things we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants there can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements that we have with our employees collaborators and consultants will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and confidential information or will provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information accordingly there also can be no assurance that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

litigation other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property   infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent   us from selling our products or services 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets or introduce new products we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products or services and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products or services in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government   regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may   be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

p roducts are not subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease certain of our products will become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable agencies of other countries including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

molecular diagnostic products in particular depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance from the fda following a premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition the regulatory approval or clearance process required to design manufacture market sell  and support  our existing and future products that are intended for and marketed and labeled as “research use only” or ruo is uncertain if such products are used or could be used even without our consent for the diagnosis of disease if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our   business 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe the asiapacific region and brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom and singapore during 2012  the majority of our sales to international customers were denominated in foreign currencies while the majority of our purchases of raw materials from international suppliers were denominated in us dollars shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 51  50  and 45  of our total revenue for fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively we intend to continue to expand our international presence by selling to customers located outside of the united states and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow 

international sales entail a variety of risks including 

 

changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations the recent global financial downturn 

has led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax laws or tax rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the us internal revenue service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company on its tax returns we could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if material payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

an inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our operations could adversely   affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business has grown rapidly with total revenues increasing from 735 million for the year ended january 1 2006 to 115 billion  for the year ended december 30 2012  and with the number of employees increasing from 375 to approximately 2400  during the same period we expect to continue to experience substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans the continued global expansion of our business and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our management and operational systems our ability to effectively manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a global basis if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement and improve our research product development manufacturing sales and marketing and customer support programs enhance our operational and financial control systems expand train and manage our employee base integrate acquired businesses and effectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be   able to sustain operating profitability 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the timing and availability of our customers’ funding the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final week of the quarter in light of that our revenue cutoff and recognition procedures together with our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter 

a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash sharebased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the 

possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments   by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our   financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could   reduce demand for our products or services 

our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops and other living organisms the information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information including preimplantation genetic screening of embryos prenatal genetic testing genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions particularly for those that have no known cure governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our strategic equity investments may result in losses 

we periodically make strategic equity investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business the market values of these strategic equity investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control otherthantemporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses in proportion to our ownership interest this could result in future charges to our earnings it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any longterm benefits associated with these strategic investments 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and damage to our reputation 

conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses 

as of december 30 2012  we had 40 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2014 and 920 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2016 outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common 

stock if the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of 2183 per share with respect to convertible notes due 2014 and 8355 with respect to convertible notes due 2016 we expect that the noteholders will elect to convert the applicable notes upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 83 with respect to convertible notes due 2014 and 45 with respect to convertible notes due 2016 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include antitakeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us these provisions include our preferred shares rights agreement commonly known as a “poison pill” and provisions in our certificate of incorporation that give our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 

in addition certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” including section 203 of the dgcl may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina section 203 of the dgcl provides with certain exceptions for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15 and less than 85 of the voting stock exclusive of stock held by directors officers and employee plans of a company 

the above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock

legal proceedings 

tableend 

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assess on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we recorded a legal contingency loss of 30 million  in aggregate within cost of product revenue in 2012 because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates each matter presents its own unique circumstances and prior litigation does not necessarily provide a reliable basis on which to predict the outcome or range of outcomes in any individual proceeding because of the uncertainties related to the occurrence amount and range of loss on any pending litigation or claim we are currently unable to predict their ultimate outcome and with respect to any pending litigation or claim where no liability has been accrued to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in the event that opposing litigants in outstanding litigations or claims ultimately succeed at trial and any subsequent appeals on their claims any potential loss or charges in excess of any established accruals individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows in the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs or becomes probable and potentially in future periods 

on november 24 2010 syntrix biosystems inc filed suit against us in the united states district court for the western district of washington at tacoma case no c105870bhs alleging that we willfully infringed us patent no 6951682 by selling our beadchip array products and that we misappropriated syntrix’s trade secrets fact and expert discovery is complete in the case in november and december 2012 we filed motions for summary judgment that the patent is not infringed and is invalid and that syntrix’s trade secrets claims are barred by various statutes of limitation syntrix filed a motion for summary judgment that the patent is valid on january 30 2013 the court granted our motion for summary judgment on syntrix’s trade secret claims and dismissed those claims from the case the court denied syntrix’s motion for summary judgment on validity and denied our motion for summary judgment for noninfringement and invalidity a trial is scheduled to begin on february 26 2013 

we have thoroughly investigated syntrix’s claims and believe the claims are without merit while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability we cannot estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss as there are significant legal and factual issues to be resolved for example each party has filed motions seeking to exclude portions of the other party’s expert testimony and to preclude the other party from introducing certain other evidence at trial in addition to posttrial briefing the parties would likely engage in appellate motion practice the result of which is also unpredictable and could significantly affect the outcome of the case

our financial results have been and will continue to be impacted by several significant trends which are described below while these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item 1 part i of this report and the other transactions events and trends discussed in “risk factors” in item 1a part i of this report 

funding environment 

  

there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe in particular focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting slow economic growth we believe this uncertainty will continue in 2013 which could lead to purchasing delays and could negatively impact our business 

while many of our customers receive funding from government agencies to purchase our products or services we are increasingly less dependent on government funding in fiscal 2012 approximately 30 of our total revenue came from commercial customers who are not reliant on government agencies for funding and it is our strategy to diversify our customer base to increase further the portion of our revenue from commercial customers over time however we estimate that approximately onethird of our total revenue continues to be derived directly or indirectly from funding provided by the us national institute of health nih in fiscal 2012 the nih budget increased 1 as compared to fiscal 2011 levels nih funding for the first quarter of 2013 will be subject to the continuing resolution that was signed into law by president obama and funds the nih at 90 of budget the significance and timing of any reductions to the nih budget from march 2013 may be significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of the budget control act of 2011 and by whether these provisions remain in effect in addition the us department of health and human services hhs of which the nih is a part has the ability to reallocate funds within its budget to spare the nih from the full effect of hhs budget reductions we further believe that allocations within the nih budget will continue to favor genetic analysis tools generally and in particular research programs that utilize nextgeneration sequencing 

nextgeneration sequencing   

nextgeneration sequencing has become a core technology for modern life science research and is increasingly being used in the applied molecular diagnostics and translational markets over the next several years expansion of the sequencing market including an increase in the number of samples available and enhancements in our product portfolio will continue to drive demand for our nextgeneration sequencing technologies our sequencing instrument installed base continued to expand in 2012 as a result we believe that our sequencing consumable revenue will continue to grow in future periods 

our sequencing instrument portfolio primarily includes the hiseq product family and miseq we began full commercial shipments in the fourth quarter of 2012 of our previously announced hiseq 2500 sequencing system which allows customers to sequence an entire human genome in approximately a day our miseq sequencing system is a lowcost personal sequencing system that we believe will provide individual researchers a platform with rapid turnaround time high accuracy and streamlined workflow we believe our miseq systems will continue to be a competitive offering in the lower throughput sequencing market and help us expand our presence in this emerging market segment 

microarrays 

as a complement to nextgeneration sequencing we believe microarrays offer a less expensive faster and highly accurate technology for use when genetic content is already known the information content of microarrays is fixed and reproducible as such microarrays provide repeatable standardized assays for certain subsets of nucleotide bases within the overall genome as the cost of sequencing continues to decrease we believe that life science researchers will migrate certain whole genome array studies to sequencing over the next few years however we expect this decline to be offset by demand from customers in applied and translational markets 

financial overview 

financial highlights for 2012  include the following 

 in 2012 we completed the relocation of our headquarters that started in 2011 and incurred 263 million  in headquarter relocation expense which primarily included a ceaseuse loss upon vacating our prior headquarters double rent expense during the transition to the new facility and the accretion of interest expense on the related lease exit liability we do not expect to incur significant additional headquarter relocation expense other than the accretion of interest expense on lease exit liability 

in 2012 we also incurred 231 million  in expenses associated with the unsolicited tender offer for shares of our common stock commenced by ckh acquisition corp and roche holding ltd together “roche” in early 2012 we anticipate incurring additional advisory expenses through mid2013 

 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which was signed into law on january 2 2013 included the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 30 2012 did not include the impact of the federal research credit generated in 2012 since the law was enacted subsequent to our reporting period had the legislation been enacted in 2012 the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 30 2012 would have been reduced by approximately 20 million our provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2013 will include the tax benefit as a result of the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research credit for 2012

to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 30 2012  january 1 2012  and january 2 2011  stated as a percentage of total revenue 



our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 the years ended december 30 2012  january 1 2012  and january 2 2011  were 52 weeks respectively 

revenue 



product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments services and other revenue consists primarily of instrument service contract revenue as well as sequencing and genotyping service revenue 

2012  compared to 2011   

consumables revenue increased   1335 million  or 22  to 7293 million  in 2012 compared to 5958 million  in 2011 the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of sequencing consumables driven by higher consumable sales per hiseq instrument and the growth in both the hiseq and miseq installed base 

instrument revenue decreased   588 million  or 16  to 3143 million  in 2012 compared to 3731 million  in 2011 driven by a decrease in hiseq shipments partially offset by a full year of miseq shipments in 2012 as compared to less than two quarters of shipments in 2011 

revenue in 2011 reflects the impact of discounts provided to customers under our genome analyzer tradein program the estimated incremental sales incentive provided under this tradein program was approximately 111 million based on the total discount provided from list price in excess of our average discount on hiseq 2000 sales during the period the genome analyzer tradein program was completed in q4 2011 see “revenue recognition” in note “1 summary of significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on the genome analyzer tradein program 

the increase in service and other revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by an increase in our instrument service contract revenue as a result of our growing installed base as well as an increase in our genotyping and sequencing service revenue 

2011  compared to 2010   

consumables revenue increased 908 million or 18 to 5958 million in 2011 compared to 5050 million in 2010 the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of sequencing consumables which accounted for more than half of our consumables revenue in 2011 driven by growth in the installed base of our sequencing systems partially offset by a decrease in the consumable revenue per sequencing instrument 

instrument revenue increased 485 million or 15 to 3731 million in 2011 compared to 3246 million in 2010 the increase was primarily attributable to the launch of miseq in the third quarter of 2011 and higher hiseq revenue primarily driven by increased average selling price following completion of the genome analyzer tradein program during the first half of 2011 these increases in instrument revenue were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our genome analyzer from 2010 to 2011 as our genome analyzer customers upgraded to hiseq 2000 

revenue from hiseq 2000 sales in 2011 and 2010 was impacted by discounts provided to customers under our genome analyzer tradein program the estimated incremental sales incentive provided under this tradein program was approximately 111 million and 478 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively see “revenue recognition” in note “1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on the genome analyzer tradein program 

the increase in service and other revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily driven by an increase in our instrument service contract revenue resulting from our expanded installed base and an increase in sequencing services 

gross margin 



2012  compared to 2011     

gross profit in 2012 increased  in comparison to 2011 primarily due to higher sales gross margin improved in 2012 due in large part to the shift in sales mix from instruments to consumables which have a higher margin than instruments this improvement was partially offset by a legal settlement charge recorded to cost of sales in 2012 in addition instrument sales in 2011 were affected by promotional discounts provided to customers on hiseq 2000 sales including the genome analyzer tradein program based on the estimated amount of incremental sales incentive provided the genome analyzer tradein 

program negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 11 in 2011 this tradein program was completed in q4 2011 

2011  compared to 2010   

gross margin increased in 2011 compared to 2010 during the period the gross margin of our instrument sales improved primarily driven by an increase in average selling price per instrument as our genome analyzer tradein program was substantially completed in the first half of 2011 the genome analyzer tradein program negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 11 and 53 in 2011 and 2010 respectively based on the estimated amount of incremental sales incentive provided the gross margin of our consumable sales also increased as we experienced a shift in sales mix from lower gross margin microarray consumables to higher gross margin sequencing consumables primarily due to the expansion of our sequencing instrument installed base the improvements in gross margins were partially offset by the negative impact from higher stock compensation expense and higher amortization expense of acquired intangible assets included in cost of revenue 

operating expense 



2012  compared to 2011    

research and development expense increased  by 341 million  or 17  in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to a 214 million  impairment loss recognized for iprd recorded as a result of a prior acquisition and increased personnel expenses as we continue to increase our investment in projects to develop and commercialize new products in addition we incurred increased facilities expenses in 2012 as the rental fees for our current headquarters are higher than our prior facility 

selling general and administrative expense increased by 241 million  in 2012 from 2011 the increase is primarily driven by a 158 million increase in personnel expenses associated with increased headcount and a 95 million increase in legal and other consulting fees personnel expenses included salaries sharebased compensation and benefits these increases in expense were partially offset by a 23 million decrease in bad debt expense as certain customer bankruptcies impacted us in 2011 in addition we had the benefit of a 23 million legal settlement gain recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in 2011 

in q3 2012 we completed the relocation of our headquarters that started in 2011 during 2012 we incurred 263 million  in additional headquarter relocation expense primarily consisting of ceaseuse loss associated with vacating our prior headquarters double rent expense during the transition to our new facility and accretion of interest expense on the lease exit liability headquarter relocation expense recorded in 2011 consisted of accelerated depreciation and rent expense on the new facility during the transition period of occupying both the current and new facility 

during q1 2012 ckh acquisition corporation and roche holding ltd together “roche” made an unsolicited tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of our common stock for up to 5100 per share during 2012 we recorded 231 million  of expenses incurred in relation to roche’s unsolicited tender offer consisting primarily of legal advisory and other professional fees 

in late 2011 we announced restructuring plans to reduce our global workforce and to consolidate certain facilities as a result of the restructuring effort we recorded additional restructuring charges of 35 million  during 2012 comprised primarily of separation and other employee costs 

acquisition related expense gain net  in 2012 consisted of acquisition transaction costs of 08 million and changes in fair value of contingent consideration of  20 million  acquisition related expense gain net  in 2011 consisted of gains related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration offset by acquired inprocess research and development of 54 million related to a milestone payment for a prior acquisition 

  

2011  compared to 2010   

the increase in research and development expense in 2011 from 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expenses of 175 million associated with increased average headcount during 2011 and an increase of 29 million in research and development supplies personnel expenses included salaries sharebased compensation and benefits 

the increase in selling general and administrative expense in 2011 from 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expenses of 335 million associated with the growth of our business during the period the remaining increase was primarily driven by a 40 million increase in bad debt expenses as a result of customer bankruptcies and a 37 million increase in supplies repairs and maintenance expenses these increases were partially offset by a legal settlement gain of 23 million representing the payment we received to settle an outstanding commercial dispute 

in 2011 we relocated our headquarters to another facility in san diego california and incurred 418 million in headquarter relocation expense which included a ceaseuse loss upon vacating our prior headquarters accelerated depreciation of certain property and equipment and double rent expense during the transition to the new facility 

in q4 2011 we announced a restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce by approximately 200 employees or approximately 8 and to consolidate certain facilities as a result of the restructuring effort we recorded a restructuring charge of 81 million during q4 2011 comprised primarily of severance pay and other employee separation costs 

acquisition related expense net in 2011 included a 54 million charge of acquired inprocess research and development related to a milestone payment for a prior acquisition partially offset by 45 million gains related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration acquisition related gain net in 2010 included a gain of 104 million from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration related to an acquisition partially offset by an acquired inprocess research and development charge of 13 million related to a milestone payment made related to a prior acquisition 

other income expense net 



2012  compared to 2011    

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized a gain of 486 million  on the sale of our minority ownership interest in decode genetics a costmethod investment we also recorded an impairment loss of 27 million  on another costmethod investment that was determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired 

interest income increased in 2012 primarily due to a 60 million  recovery of a previously impaired note receivable and an increase in realized gains from our investment portfolio interest expenses in both 2012 and 2011 are primarily comprised of accretion of the discount on our convertible senior notes 

other expense income net  in 2012 primarily consisted of foreign exchange losses other expense income net  in 2011 primarily consisted of a 376 million loss on the extinguishment of debt recorded on conversions of our 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 

2011  compared to 2010   

the decrease in interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily driven by lower interest rates despite the increase in our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balance during the period interest expense increased during the period primarily due to the accretion of discount on our 9200 million 025 convertible senior notes due 2016 issued in the first half of 2011 partially offset by the decrease in interest expense associated with the repayment of 3499 million in principal for the 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 during 2011 

other expense income net in 2011 primarily consisted of a loss of 376 million on the extinguishment of debt recorded on conversions of our 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 and a 11 million foreign exchange loss recorded during the period the loss on extinguishment of debt was calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the converted notes and their fair value as of the settlement dates other expense income net in 2010 primarily consisted of a 132 million impairment charge related to a costmethod investment and a related note receivable partially offset by a 29 million gain on acquisition recorded for the difference between the carrying value of a cost method investment prior to the acquisition and the fair value of that investment at the time of acquisition and foreign exchange gains 

costmethod investment related gain loss net in 2010 consisted of a 132 million impairment charge recorded on a costmethod investment and a related note receivable partially offset by a 29 million gain on acquisition of a previous investee 

provision for income taxes 



2012  compared to 2011    

our effective tax rate was 321  for 2012 the variance from the us statutory rate of 35 was primarily attributable to the change in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory rates our future effective tax rate may vary from the us statutory tax rate due to the change in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory rates benefits related to tax credits and the tax impact of nondeductible expenses and other permanent differences between income before income taxes and taxable income the effective tax rate in 2011 closely approximated the us statutory rate because a significant portion of our earnings were subject to us taxation 

  

2011  compared to 2010   

the effective tax rate in 2011 closely approximated the us statutory rate because a significant portion of our earnings was subject to us taxation the increase in the effective tax rate in 2011 from 2010 was primarily attributable to lower nontaxable gains recorded on the changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions and higher nondeductible acquired iprd charges recorded in 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 30 2012  we had approximately 4340 million  in cash and cash equivalents a 1310 million  increase from last year due to the factors described in the “cash flow summary” below our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries at december 30 2012  were approximately 2655 million  it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

historically we have liquidated our shortterm investments andor issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities at december 30 2012  we have 9162 million  in 

shortterm investments our shortterm investments include marketable securities consisting of debt securities in governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury notes 

in 2011 we issued 9200 million in principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature on march 15 2016 2016 notes we pay 025 interest per annum on the principal amount of the 2016 notes semiannually in arrears in cash on march 15 and september 15 of each year in 2007 we issued 4000 million in principal of convertible senior notes that mature on february 15 2014 2014 notes we pay 0625 interest per annum on the principal amount of the 2014 notes semiannually in arrears in cash on february 15 and august 15 of each year additional information about the convertible notes including their conversion features is described in note “7 convertible senior notes” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k as of december 30 2012  the principal amounts of our 2016 notes and 2014 notes were 9200 million  and 401 million  respectively our commitment of interest payment on these outstanding notes is 84 million  on an annual basis 

our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include expenditures related to 

 

in 2012 we acquired bluegnome for total cash and other consideration of 955 million  which included 75 million  in fair value of contingent cash consideration in 2011 we acquired epicentre for total cash and other consideration of 714 million  which included 46 million  in the fair value of contingent consideration settled in stock and 74 million  in the fair value of contingent cash consideration 

our board of directors has authorized several common stock repurchase programs in 2012 we used 825 million  to repurchase our outstanding shares under these programs as of december 30 2012  we had authorization from our board of directors to repurchase to an additional 1675 million  of our common stock 

during 2011 we used 3143 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of our 2016 notes to purchase 49 million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the issuance we also used part of the net proceeds for the extinguishment of 3499 million principal amount of our 2014 notes upon conversion we used the remaining net proceeds for other general corporate purposes which included acquisitions and purchases of our common stock 

we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

we anticipate that our current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our near term capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months including the pending acquisition of verinata operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes during the fiscal year ended december 30 2012  we were not involved in any “offbalance sheet arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the securities and exchange commission 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december 30 2012  aggregated by type amounts in thousands

maturity can result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table see note “7 convertible senior notes” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1 organization and significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from instrument service contract sales genotyping and sequencing services and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgments and estimates and actual results may differ from our estimates 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met all revenue is recorded net of any discounts 

revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered typically evenly over the contract term revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether refund rights exist if there are refund rights or payment terms based on future performance we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 

we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products or services these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame approximately three to six months of the contract execution date revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a standalone basis 

for transactions with multiple deliverables consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective 

evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence exists we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 

in order to establish vsoe of selling price we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry we have rarely established selling price using thirdparty evidence if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

in 2010 we offered an incentive with the launch of the hiseq 2000 that enabled existing genome analyzer customers to trade in their genome analyzer and receive a discount on the purchase of a hiseq 2000 the incentive was limited to customers who had purchased a genome analyzer as of the date of the announcement and was the first significant tradein program we have offered the genome analyzer tradein program was completed in 2011 we accounted for hiseq 2000 discounts related to the tradein program as reductions to revenue upon recognition of the hiseq 2000 sales revenue which is later than the date the tradein program was launched 

in certain markets the company sells products and provides services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products in most sales through distributors the product is delivered directly to customers in cases where the product is delivered to a distributor revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor andor the enduser if required by the applicable sales contract the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers these transactions are accounted for in accordance with the company’s revenue recognition policy described herein 

investments 

we invest in various types of securities including debt securities in governmentsponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities as of december 30 2012  we have 9162 million  in shortterm investments in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we classify our investments as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 

as discussed in note “6 fair value measurements” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level 2 these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly such as yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings and in the process we apply judgments and estimates that if changed could significantly affect our results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our gross trade accounts receivables totaled 2193 million  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was 43 million  at december 30 2012  our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at lower of cost or market we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycles quality issues historical experience and usage forecasts our gross inventory totaled 1786 million  and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was 199 million  at december 30 2012  historically our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses however if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters we assess on a regular basis the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors which include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates resulting in a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the fair values assigned defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets net of liabilities assumed as goodwill these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

in connection with certain of our acquisitions additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones in these cases a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable inputs such as anticipated future cash flows riskfree adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related expense gain net a component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income this method requires significant management judgment including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 

management typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our longlived assets are impaired a review of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment if indicators of impairment exist we assess the recoverability of the affected longlived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts 

in order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows the time value of money and other factors that a willing market participant would consider significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

sharebased compensation 

we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

the determination of fair value of sharebased awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected life of an award expected dividends and the riskfree interest rate we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards we amortize the fair value of sharebased compensation on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly sharebased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

warranties 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on instruments additionally we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve and adjust if necessary the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 

ceaseuse loss upon exit of facility 

in 2012 we completed the relocation of our headquarters to a new facility in san diego california and recorded headquarter relocation expense of 263 million  the majority of which was attributable to a ceaseuse loss recorded upon vacating our prior headquarter facility the lease on our prior headquarter facility expires in 2023 the ceaseuse loss is calculated as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period adjusted for deferred items and leasehold improvements in calculating the ceaseuse loss management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and the riskadjusted discount rate these assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates resulting in significant adjustments to the ceaseuse loss recorded 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of the company’s future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies based on the available evidence as of december 30 2012  we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we recorded a valuation allowance of 18 million  against certain us deferred tax assets 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company’s return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined

interest rate sensitivity 

our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments in addition if a 100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2013  our interest income would change by approximately 135 million  in relation to amounts we would expect to earn based on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 30 2012  

changes in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes   during 2011 we issued 920 million in aggregate principal amount of our 025 convertible senior notes due 2016 at our election the notes are convertible into cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in each case under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price for a sustained period at 130 above the conversion price of 8355 the notes will become convertible upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our thencurrent incremental borrowing rate if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted the implicit interest rate for the notes is 45 an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of 100 million aggregate principal amount of the notes would result in a loss of approximately 30 million  

market price sensitive instruments 

in order to reduce potential equity dilution in connection with the issuance and potential conversion of our 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 we entered into convertible note hedge transactions entitling us to purchase up to 18322000 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 2183 per share subject to adjustment in addition we sold to the hedge transaction counterparties warrants exercisable on a netshare basis for up to 18322000 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 31435 per share subject to adjustment the antidilutive effect of the note hedge transactions if any could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants which occur during 2014 assuming the warrants are exercised 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the company’s us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro yen british pound sterling australian dollar and singapore dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income we recorded a 37 million  net currency exchange loss for the fiscal year ended december 30 2012  on business transactions net of hedging transactions which are included in other expense income net in our consolidated statements of income 

we use forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities as of december 30 2012  the total notional amount of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was approximately 512 million

industry background 

genetics primer 

the instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna with the complete set of dna for any organism referred to as its genome dna contains small regions called genes which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively these nucleotide bases are present in a precise order known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a partial copy of its dna sequence  called messenger rna mrna  is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function the illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic 

variations among organisms are due in large part to differences in their dna sequences changes caused by insertions deletions inversions or duplications of nucleotide bases may result in certain genes becoming overexpressed excessive protein production underexpressed reduced protein production or silenced altogether sometimes triggering changes in cellular function these changes can be the result of heredity but most often they occur at random the most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide polymorphism snp which is a variation in a single position of a nucleotide base in a dna sequence copy number variations cnvs occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes segments of a gene or stretches of dna 

in humans genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see eg height hair eye color etc more importantly these genetic variations can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimers disease they can also impact an individuals response to certain drug treatments causing them to respond well not respond at all or experience adverse side effects  an area of study known as pharmacogenomics 

scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans as well as a broad range of animals plants and microorganisms researchers investigating human viral and bacterial genetic variation are helping us to better understand the mechanisms of disease and thereby develop more effective therapeutics and diagnostics greater insight into genetic variation in plants eg food and biofuel crops and animals eg livestock and domestic animals is enabling scientists to improve crop yields and animal breeding programs 

the methods for studying genetic variation and biological function include sequencing snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression profiling and gene regulation and epigenetic analysis each of which is addressed by our breadth of products and services 

life sciences research primer 

life science research encompasses the study of all living things from humans animals and plants to viruses and bacteria it is being performed in government university pharmaceutical biotechnology and agrigenomics laboratories around the world where scientists are seeking to expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life beginning at the genetic level where our tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes life science research expands to include the study of the cells tissues organs systems and other components that make up living organisms this research supports development of new more effective clinical diagnostics and medicines to improve human health as well as advances in agriculture and animal husbandry to meet the worlds growing needs for food and energy 

molecular diagnostics primer 

molecular diagnostic assays or tests are designed to identify the biological indicators linked with disease and drug metabolism providing physicians with information to more effectively diagnose treat and monitor both acute and chronic disease conditions they are an integral part of personalized healthcare where the unique makeup of each individual will be taken into account in diagnosing disease and managing treatment through the use of more tailored therapies biological indicators that can be measured by these assays include protein or gene expression methylation levels copy number variations and the presence or absence of a specific gene or group of genes 

there are molecular diagnostic assays on the market including assays for infectious disease cancer and heart disease as well as molecularbased drug metabolism assays to help physicians select the most effective therapy with the fewest side effects our innovative technologies and products are contributing to the development of a wide range of potential molecular diagnostic assays our own efforts in this area are currently focused on the identification of certain genetic markers with potential diagnostic and therapeutic utility 

growing news coverage about the clinical relevance of newly discovered genetic markers has prompted consumer interest in having personal genomes analyzed sparking the development of the consumer genomics market we believe there are distinct medical benefits especially for people with family histories of certain diseases of knowing your disease predisposition several companies including illumina now offer personal sequencing or genotyping services working with physician groups and genetic counselors to interpret the results for consumers 

we believe the growth in consumer genomics and the use of molecular diagnostic assays will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and the economics of the pharmaceutical industry by facilitating an increased emphasis on preventative and predictive molecular medicine ushering in the era of personalized medicine 

our principal markets 

from the companys inception we have believed that the analysis of genetic variation and function will play an increasingly important role in molecular biology and that by empowering genetic analysis our tools will advance disease research drug development and the creation of molecular tests in addition to developing sequencing and arraybased solutions for life science applied and consumer genomics markets we are making inroads into the emerging molecular diagnostics market 

life sciences research market 

our core business is in the life sciences research market which consists of laboratories generally associated with universities medical research centers and government institutions as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions are using our products and services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities such as nextgeneration sequencing midtohighcomplexity genotyping and gene expression for wholegenome discovery and profiling and low complexity genotyping and gene expression for highthroughput targeted screening dna sequencing is growing the most rapidly among these three areas due to the creation of next generation sequencing technologies such as sbs it is fueled by private and public funding new global initiatives to broadly characterize genetic variation and the migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencingbased technologies 

applied markets 

we provide products and services for various other markets which we refer to as “applied markets” the largest among these is the “agbio” market where government and corporate researchers use our sequencing and arraybased tools to accelerate and enhance agricultural research for example we currently offer microarrays that contain snps for custom and focused genotyping of seeds and crops such as maize tomatoes apples and peaches livestock such as cattle horses pigs and sheep and companion animals such as dogs customers use these tools to perform selective breeding through highvalue trait screening methods thereby accelerating and enhancing the process as compared to traditional methods such as crossbreeding we have developed a highgrowth recurring revenue business in both the livestock and agricultural segments which represented approximately 12 of our shipments on a dollar basis in 2011 emerging opportunities in the applied markets include forensics and pet genomics 

molecular diagnostics market 

molecular diagnostics is the fastest growing segment of the diagnostics market genetics and oncology represent the primary areas of growth within molecular diagnostics at present this growth is largely driven by infectious disease testing but molecular diagnostics is rapidly expanding into new areas such as noninvasive prenatal testing and cancer management the increasing efficacy of molecular diagnostics is driven by the continued discovery of genetic markers with proven clinical utility the increasing adoption of geneticbased diagnostic tests and the expansion of reimbursement programs to include a greater number of approved molecular diagnostic tests we believe our sequencing and array instrument platforms are foundational to continued growth in this market and we intend to submit our iscan and miseq systems to the us food and drug administration or fda for clearance as a device for use with in vitro diagnostic ivd products in connection with our anticipated fda submission we have initiated a clinical trial for a cytogenetics test intended to be used on our iscan instrument platform as an aid in the postnatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities known to be associated with developmental delay and mental retardation following completion of the required clinical trial we intend to seek fda clearance for the iscan instrument platform and related reagents in addition we have initiated development of clinical diagnostic tests on the miseq system in the areas of genetics and infectious disease and upon completion of the required work we intend to submit these to the fda for clearance our research efforts in the development of cancer diagnostic panels initially focusing on ovarian gastric and colorectal cancers continues and we have filed provisional patent applications on our discoveries to date 

in addition as the molecular diagnostics market continues to evolve and emerge we believe the translational and consumer genomic market will prove to be another opportunity for us these markets include consumer based genetic solutions as well as clinical applications in which our technology can be used to offer comprehensive sequencing and genotyping service solutions to clinicians and consumers in laboratory settings 

consumer genomics markets 

new sequencing and genotyping technologies such as those developed by illumina are driving down the cost of performing these analyses which we believe are increasingly valuable in diagnosing disease and evaluating disease risk 

consumer genomics is a nascent market but one we believe has the potential for high growth as the cost per analysis continues to drop in june 2009 we launched our individual genome sequencing service the first physicianintermediated personal genome sequencing service for consumers built around physicianpatient consultation the service requires a physicians order to initiate the process with genome sequencing performed using our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory we have established collaborations with partners to perform the secondary data analysis of personal genomes such as calculation of disease risk ancestry and information on traits of interest some of our partners as well as other companies in the directtoconsumer market use our genotyping technology and products to perform personal genotyping services 

our principal technologies 

our unique technology platforms enable the scale of experimentation necessary for genomewide discovery target selection and validation studies see figure 1 below more than 8000 customerauthored scientific publications have been published to date using these technologies representing the efforts of a large and dynamic illumina user community through rapid innovation we believe we are changing the economics of genetic research enabling projects once considered unapproachable now to be within reach of more investigators

sequencing technology 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases a c g or t in a dna sample our hiseq 25002000 hiseq 15001000 genome analyzer iix miseq and hiscansq systems represent a family of systems that we believe are setting the standard for productivity costeffectiveness and accuracy among nextgeneration sequencing technologies they are used by customers to perform wholegenome de novo and targeted resequencing of genomes and to analyze specific gene regions and genes 

wholegenome sequencing determines an organisms complete dna sequence in de novo sequencing the goal is to sequence a representative sample from a species never before sequenced in targeted resequencing a sequence of nucleotide bases is compared to a standard or reference sequence from a previously sequenced species to identify changes that reflect genetic variation understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between and within species furthers our understanding of the function of the structures encoded in the dna 

our dna sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminatorbased sequencing chemistry referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry in sbs single stranded dna is extended from a priming site one base at a time using reversible terminator nucleotides these are dna bases that can be added to a growing second strand but which initially cannot be further extended this means that at each cycle of the chemistry only one base can be added each base that is added includes a fluorescent label that is specific to the particular base a c g or t following incorporation the 

emitted light can be imaged to determine its color and thus determine the base once this is done an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the blocking group that had prevented further extension of the second strand this allows another base to be added and the cycle can then be repeated our technology is capable of generating over 600 billion bases of dna sequence from a single experiment with a single sample preparation key aspects of the sbs chemistry are the subject of significant intellectual property owned by us 

in our dna sequencing systems we apply the sbs biochemistry on microscopic clusters of dna each cluster starts as a single dna molecule fragment typically a few hundred bases long attached to the inside surface of a flow cell we then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create copies of each starting molecule as the copies are made they are covalently linked to the surface so they cannot diffuse away after a number of cycles of amplification each cluster might have approximately 1000 copies of the original starting molecule but still be only about a micron onemillionth of a meter in diameter by making so many copies the fluorescent signal from each cluster is significantly increased because the clusters are so small hundreds of millions of clusters can be independently formed inside a single flow cell this large number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of sbs biochemistry and fluorescent imaging sequence reads are analyzed using specially developed data analysis software 

with the ability to generate over 600 gb of dna sequence per run on our highest throughput sequencing instruments the hiseq 25002000 our sbs sequencing technology provides researchers with the broadest range of applications and the opportunity to sequence even large mammalian genomes in days rather than weeks or years since the launch of our first genome analyzer in 2007 our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a factor of 100 

beadarray technology 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously enabling largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique highthroughput cost effective and flexible manner the arrays manufactured using beadarray technology are imaged by our iscan hiscan and hiscansq systems for a broad range of dna and rna analysis applications including snp discovery snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression analysis and methylation analysis in the course of six years we have increased the content capacity on a single array from 100000 markers to 20 million markers 

our proprietary beadarray technology consists of microscopic silica beads with each bead covered with hundreds of thousands of copies of oligonucleotides or oligos that act as the capture sequences in one of our assays we deploy our beadarray technology on beadchips  silicon wafers the size of a microscope slide with varying numbers of sample sites per slide beadchips are chemically etched to create tens of millions of wells for each sample site 

we create unique bead pools or sensors for different dna and rna analysis applications by affixing thousands to millions of copies of a specific type of oligonucleotide molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make different batches of beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that beads function as a sensor to form an array a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells one bead per well because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called “decoding” to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we employ several proprietary methods for decoding which is a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a functional validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each bead type multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads 

an experiment is performed by preparing a sample such as dna and introducing it to the array the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated beads the molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with fluorescent dye either before or after the binding which can be detected by shining a laser on the beadchip this allows the detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

using our beadarray technology we achieve highthroughput analysis with a high density of test sites per array and are able to format arrays in various configurations we seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive consumables and valuable samples and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments these features enable our beadarray technology to be applied to highgrowth markets of snp genotyping and cnv analysis and have allowed us to be a key player in the gene expression 

market 

veracode technology 

our proprietary veracode technology is a detection method for multiplex assays that require high precision accuracy and speed when deployed on our beadxpress reader system veracode technology provides a highthroughput solution for biomarker research and validation pharmaceutical development industrial and agriculture testing clinical research forensics and molecular diagnostic assay development 

the veracode technology platform leverages the power of digital holographic codes to provide a detection method for multiplex assays veracode enables lowcost multiplexing from 1 to 384plex in a single well the veracode technology consists of cylindrical glass beads measuring 240 microns in length by 28 microns in diameter inscribed with a unique digital holographic code to designate and track the specific analyte or genotype of interest throughout the multiplex reaction when excited by a laser each veracode bead emits a unique code image allowing for quick and specific detection by the beadxpress reader system 

depending on the desired multiplex levels assays are created by pooling microbeads with code diversities from one to several hundred unlike traditional microarrays the veracode microbeads are used in solution which takes advantage of solutionphase kinetics for more rapid hybridization times dramatically reducing the time to achieve results 

eco realtime pcr technology 

in 2010 we purchased helixis inc and its novel realtime pcr technology and introduced the eco realtime pcr system to the market realtime pcr also known as quantitative pcr or qpcr is used to amplify and simultaneously quantify a targeted dna molecule with applications in gene expression viral quantification array data validation pathogen detection and genotyping the procedure follows the same steps as pcr whereby thermal cycling alternately heating and cooling the dna sample from 20 to 40 times causes the dna to selfreplicate resulting in the doubling of dna product with each cycle realtime pcr uses various fluorescent detection chemistries to enable the monitoring of the pcr reaction as it progresses data are collected at each cycle rather than at the end of the reaction providing higher precision increased sensitivity increased dynamic range and higher resolution 

the eco system combines a proprietary thermal system fourcolor multiplex capabilities and a finetuned optical system to deliver accurate qpcr results its unique design provides superior thermal uniformity supporting highquality pcr performance for demanding applications such as high resolution melt hrm curve analysis used for snp genotyping dna fingerprinting species identification hla compatibility typing allelic prevalence and dna methylation analysis measuring just over one cubic foot in size we believe the eco systems overall performance rivals larger more expensive systems

introduced in june 2009 illuminas individual genome sequencing service provides personal genome sequencing for consumers it is performed in our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory using our nextgeneration sequencing technology the service is built around physicianpatient consultation with a physicians order required to initiate the process the offering includes sequencing of an individuals dna to 30times depth providing information on snp variation and other structural characteristics of the genome such as insertions deletions and rearrangements we are collaborating with a number of partners to provide secondary data analysis such as calculation of disease risk ancestry and information on traits of interest the service requires individuals to follow our physicianmediated process which involves preservice consultation patient consent and a sevenday “cooling off” period during which the patient may withdraw consent the final genome data is returned to the physician who in turn delivers it to the consumer 

intellectual property 

we have an extensive intellectual property portfolio including as of february 1 2012 ownership of or exclusive licenses to 235 issued us patents and 173 pending us patent applications including 11 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents our issued patents include those directed to various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments and chemical detection technologies and have terms that expire between 2012 and 2030 we continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies we have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries 

we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our trade secrets to enforce our patents copyrights and trademarks to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment we have exclusive licenses from tufts university to patents that are directed to our beadarray technology these patents were filed by dr david walt who is a member of our board of directors the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2012 and 2020 we have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect 

research and development 

we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled scientists and engineers who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize and support commercialization of the products and services derived from our technologies 

our research and development expenses for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were 1969 million  1779 million  and 1406 million  respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2012 as a result of the growth of our business and as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts 

marketing and distribution 

our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and animal and agricultural research our potential customers include leading genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics and consumer genomics companies the genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will ultimately be driven by among other items 

 

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe latin america and the asiapacific region in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in addition in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region latin america the middle east and south africa we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products we expect to continue to increase our sales and distribution resources during 2012 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products 

manufacturing 

we manufacture sequencing and array platforms reagent kits scanning equipment and oligos our manufacturing capacity for consumables and instruments has grown during 2011 to support increased customer demand to continue to increase throughput and improve the quality and manufacturing yield as we increase the complexity of our products we are exploring ways to continue increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances 

raw materials 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies we have multiple commercial sources for many of our components and supplies however there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from single source suppliers to mitigate potential risks arising from single source suppliers we believe that we can redesign our products for alternative components or use alternative reagents if required in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain 

competition 

although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect to continue to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets these include companies such as affymetrix inc agilent technologies inc complete genomics inc helicos biosciences corporation general electric company life technologies corporation luminex corporation pacific biosciences of california inc qiagen nv and roche diagnostics corp among others some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over competing products 

segment and geographic information 

in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for segment reporting we have determined that we have two operating segments for purposes of recording and reporting our financial results life sciences and diagnostics our life sciences operating segment includes all products and services related to the research market namely the product lines based on our sequencing beadarray veracode and realtime pcr technologies our diagnostics operating segment focuses on the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics during all periods presented our diagnostics operating segment had limited activity accordingly our financial results for both operating segments are reported on an aggregate basis as one reportable segment we will begin reporting in two operating segments once revenues operating profit or loss or assets of the diagnostics operating segment exceed 10 of the consolidated amounts 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 5268 million or 50 of our total revenue during fiscal 2011 compared to 4038 million or 45 and 3191 million or 48 in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively sales to customers outside of the united states were generally denominated in us dollars in 2008 we reorganized our international structure to establish more efficient channels among product development product manufacturing and sales the reorganization increased our foreign subsidiaries anticipated dependence on the us entity for management decisions financial support production assets and inventory thereby making the foreign subsidiaries more of a direct and integral component of the us entitys operations as a result we reassessed the primary economic environment of our foreign subsidiaries and determined the subsidiaries are more us dollar based resulting in a us dollar functional currency determination we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note “15 segment information geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

backlog 

our backlog was 2505 million and 2990 million at january 1 2012 and january 2 2011 respectively generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom we expect an estimated 90 of the backlog as of january 1 2012 to be shipped within the fiscal year ending december 30 2012 although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue even after title transfer depending on the specific arrangement with a customer and the applicable accounting treatment 

seasonality 

historically customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation although demand for our 

products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as a result in part of us academic customers spending unused budget allocations before the end of the us governments fiscal year on september 30 of each year during 2011 however the us government extended the timeframe over which the unused budget allocations could be utilized which led to purchasing delays from some of our customers 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

government regulation 

our products are not currently subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as molecular diagnostic products regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will be a significant factor in the development testing production and marketing of such products products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use will be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

the shorter 510k clearance process which generally takes from three to six months after submission but can take significantly longer may be utilized if it is demonstrated that the new product is “substantially equivalent” to a similar product that has already been cleared by the fda the longer pma process is much more costly uncertain and generally takes from nine months to two years after filing because we cannot be certain that any molecular diagnostic products that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process or will ultimately be approved at all the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed and may be significantly more expensive than anticipated if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

in addition the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture market and sell our existing and future products that are intended for and marketed and labeled as “research use only” or ruo is uncertain if such products are used or could be used even without our consent for the diagnosis of disease if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

employees 

as of january 1 2012 we had a total of approximately 2200 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

we are subject to a takeover bid that may be disruptive to our business and threatens to adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

ckh acquisition corp and roche holding ltd together “roche” have commenced an unsolicited hostile cash tender offer to purchase all of our outstanding common stock the roche tender offer is subject to numerous conditions some of which are at the discretion of roche roche also announced that it intends to oppose the reelection of four directors serving on our board of directors whose terms expire at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders including the chairman of the board and our chief executive officer in connection with the roche tender offer four stockholder class action lawsuits have been filed against us and we anticipate that additional lawsuits may be filed responding to the roche tender offer the adverse proxy solicitation and the lawsuits may be a major distraction for management and may require us to incur significant costs moreover the hostile and unsolicited nature of the offer may disrupt our business by causing uncertainty among current and potential employees producers suppliers customers and other constituencies important to our success which could negatively impact our financial results and business initiatives we believe the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations based on many factors including uncertainty associated with the unsolicited offer by roche 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include antitakeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us these provisions include our preferred shares rights agreement “rights agreement” commonly known as a “poison pill” and provisions in our certificate of incorporation that give our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control one of the conditions of the roche tender offer is the removal or amendment of our rights agreement such that roche’s acquisition of our stock would not trigger the provisions of the rights agreement to date our board has not agreed to such removal or amendment 

in addition certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” including section 203 of the dgcl may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina section 203 of the dgcl provides with certain exceptions for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15 and less than 85 of the voting stock exclusive of stock held by directors officers and employee plans of a company 

the above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of illumina including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock 

reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics and consumer genomics companies and their capital spending budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services these budgets are based on a wide variety of factors including the allocation of available resources to make purchases funding from government sources the spending priorities among various types of research equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary periods any decrease in capital spending or change in spending priorities of our customers could significantly reduce our revenue moreover we have no control over the timing and amount of purchases by our customers and as a result revenue from these sources may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast any delay or reduction in purchases by our customers or our inability to forecast fluctuations in demand could harm our future operating results 

the timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe in particular focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting slowing economic growth research funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries government funding of research and development is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable other programs such as defense entitlement programs or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government 

agencies that fund research and development activities such as the us national institute of health or nih past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced nih and other research and development allocations any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in   significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we   sell 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a widerange of competing technologies we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional   personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives the hostile and unsolicited nature of the roche offer coupled with roches efforts to oppose the reelection of mr flatley to our board of directors at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders may adversely affect our business by causing uncertainty among current and potential employees in addition the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use stock options and restricted stock units to provide incentives for our key personnel to remain with us and to align their interests with those of the company by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employees incentive to stay 

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis   of genetic variation and biological function 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences diagnostic agricultural and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information for instance demand for our microarray products may be adversely affected if researchers fail to find meaningful correlations between genetic variation such as snps and disease susceptibility through genome wide association studies in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our 

products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to sustain profitability 

if the quality of our products does not meet our customers expectations then our reputation could suffer and ultimately our   sales and operating earnings could be negatively   impacted 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products because our instruments and consumables are highly complex the occurrence of defects may increase as we continue to introduce new products and services and as we scale up manufacturing to meet increased demand for our products and services although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities in addition identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and thirdparty components may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with for example shipment holds product recalls and warranty or other service obligations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new   products 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on continuously developing and commercializing new products and services including improving our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to develop successfully and timely introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products there can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

 

we may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace 

if we do not successfully manage the development manufacturing and launch of new products or   services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely   affected 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results 

expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle we may delay the product launch date in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions or transition requirements or programs such as tradein programs with respect to newly launched products or products in development relative to our existing products which could adversely affect sales of our existing products the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for components and materials   used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are   delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the components or materials supplied do   not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our   products in a timely manner or at all 

the complex nature of our products requires customized precisionmanufactured components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some components and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms in addition the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier the time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields any of which would negatively impact our operating results accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the democratic republic of the congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production or increase our costs any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop and maintain   operation of our manufacturing capability we may not be able to launch or support   our products in a timely manner or at all 

we continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments consumables and products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

additionally we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and hayward california singapore and little chesterford united kingdom these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products 

also many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us 

from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we   may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or   technologies 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our   competitive position 

our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

the proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences genomics agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our proprietary position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued questions as to inventorship or ownership may also arise any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on 

favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies in that regard certain patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information among other things we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants there can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements that we have with our employees collaborators and consultants will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and confidential information or will provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information accordingly there also can be no assurance that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

litigation other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property   infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent   us from selling our products or services 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets or introduce new products we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products or services and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products or services in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government   regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may   be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

our products are not currently subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease certain of our products are likely to become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable agencies of other countries including requirements for regulatory approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

molecular diagnostic products in particular depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance from the fda following a premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite 

regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture market and sell our existing and future products that are intended for and marketed and labeled as “research use only” or ruo is uncertain if such products are used or could be used even without our consent for the diagnosis of disease if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our   business 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe the asiapacific region and brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom and singapore during 2011 the majority of our sales to international customers and purchases of raw materials from international suppliers were denominated in us dollars shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 50 45 and 48 of our total revenue for the years ended january 1 2012 january 2 2011 and january 3 2010 respectively we intend to continue to expand our international presence by selling to customers located outside of the united states and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow 

international sales entail a variety of risks including 

 

changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations the recent global financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and the   possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax laws or tax rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the irs or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company on its tax returns we could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if 

material payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we could lose some or all of the tax deduction for interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible notes if these notes are not subject to the special treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments the notes are converted or we invest in nontaxable investments 

an inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our operations could adversely   affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business has grown rapidly with total revenues increasing from 735 million for the year ended january 1 2006 to 10555 million  for the year ended january 1 2012 and with the number of employees increasing from 375 to approximately 2200 during the same period we expect to continue to experience substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans the continued global expansion of our business and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our management and operational systems our ability to effectively manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a global basis if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement and improve our research product development manufacturing sales and marketing and customer support programs enhance our operational and financial control systems expand train and manage our employee base integrate acquired businesses and effectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be   able to sustain operating profitability 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the timing and availability of our customers funding the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final week of the quarter in light of that our revenue cutoff and recognition procedures together with our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter 

a large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash sharebased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments   by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our   financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could   reduce demand for our products or services 

our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops and other living organisms the information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information including the genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our strategic equity investments may result in losses 

we periodically make strategic equity investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business the market values of these strategic equity investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control otherthantemporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses in proportion to our ownership interest this could result in future charges to our earnings it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any longterm benefits associated with these strategic investments 

conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses 

as of january 1 2012 we had 40 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2014 and 920 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2016 outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of 2183 per share with respect to convertible notes due 2014 and 8355 with respect to convertible notes due 2016 we expect that the noteholders will elect to convert the applicable notes upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 83 with respect to convertible notes due 2014 and 45  with respect to convertible notes due 2016 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted

legal proceedings 

tableend 

the company is involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property employment and contractual matters in connection with these matters the company assesses contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in its financial statements an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates because of the uncertainties related to the occurrence amount and range of loss on any pending litigation or claim management is currently unable to predict their ultimate outcome to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome the company believes however that the liability if any resulting from the aggregate amount of losses for any outstanding litigation or claim will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations

funding environment 

  

many of our customers receive funding from government agencies to purchase our instruments products and services there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe in particular focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting slowing economic growth we estimate that approximately onethird of our total revenue is derived directly or indirectly from funding provided by the us national institute of health nih after growing steadily through 2010 the nih budget experienced an approximate 1 reduction in fiscal 2011 which ended on september 30 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 based on the fiscal year 2012 congressional budget the adjusted fiscal 2012 nih budget increased 1 as compared to fiscal 2011 levels the significance and timing of any reductions to the nih budget beyond fiscal 2012 will be significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of the budget control act of 2011 which was enacted on august 2 2011 and by whether these provisions remain in effect in addition the us department of health and human services hhs of which the nih is a part has the ability to reallocate funds within its budget to spare the nih from the full effect of hhs budget reductions we continue to believe that allocations within the nih budget will continue to favor genetic analysis tools and in particular nextgeneration sequencing 

we believe the uncertainty surrounding the levels of government and academic research funding in the united states and europe will continue in 2012 which could lead to purchasing delays and could negatively impact our business 

nextgeneration sequencing   

nextgeneration sequencing has become a core technology for modern life science research over the next several years expansion of the sequencing market including an increase in the number of samples available and enhancements in our product portfolio will continue to drive demand for our nextgeneration sequencing technologies in 2011 we launched new higherthroughput sequencing consumable kits that enable our customers to sequence a greater number of samples in a single instrument run we believe that this increased throughput created excess capacity that customers were unable to fully utilize due to a shortterm lack of available samples which resulted in lower consumable sales per instrument and negatively affected sequencing instrument sales in the second half of 2011 we believe that this excess capacity will diminish as customers scale and gain access to greater numbers of samples 

with respect to sequencing instruments we began commercial shipments in the third quarter of 2011 of our previously announced miseq a lowcost personal sequencing system that we believe will provide individual researchers a platform with rapid turnaround time high accuracy and streamlined workflow we believe miseq will expand our presence in the lower throughput sequencing market in january 2012 we announced the hiseq 2500 sequencing system which will allow customers to sequence an entire human genome in approximately a day up to 120 gb in 27 hours or 600 gb per run full commercial shipments of the hiseq 2500 are expected to commence in the second half of 2012 

with respect to sequencing consumables we experienced an overall increase in sequencing consumable sales despite a decrease in the consumable revenue per instrument in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in total sequencing consumable sales was driven by the growth of our sequencing installed base we believe the decrease in consumable revenue per instrument was driven in part by funding uncertainty and the excess capacity created from the higher throughput of our new sequencing kits as we continue to make improvements that reduce the cost of sequencing we believe that more customers will use the hiseq platform which generates more revenue per instrument time than the genome analyzer and that the increased capacity from our higher throughput sequencing kits will be more fully utilized as additional samples become increasingly available over the next few quarters we believe that our sequencing consumable revenue will grow in future periods with the launch of miseq and the growth in our hiseq installed base 

microarrays 

as a complement to nextgeneration sequencing we believe microarrays offer a less expensive faster and highly accurate technology for use when genetic content is already known the information content of microarrays is fixed and reproducible as such microarrays provide repeatable standardized assays for certain subsets of nucleotide bases within the overall genome we believe that focused studies will drive future microarray sales growth however as the per genome cost of sequencing continues to decrease researchers will migrate certain whole genome array studies to sequencing at some point in the future in mid2011 we began shipments of the omni5 beadchip a foursample microarray featuring more than 43 million markers per sample with flexibility to include up to 500000 custom markers this product includes a majority of the rare variant content from the 1000 genomes project an international research effort launched in 2008 to establish the most detailed catalog of human genetic variation although the order and revenue level of microarray products fluctuated during 2011 we received record microarray orders driven by infinium exome array products in the fourth quarter of 2011 

financial overview 

financial highlights for 2011 include the following 

 29 

operating expenses which was primarily driven by headquarter relocation expense and restructuring charges recorded in 2011 

in 2011 we relocated our headquarters to another facility in san diego california and incurred 418 million  in headquarter relocation expense which included a ceaseuse loss upon vacating our prior headquarters accelerated depreciation of certain property and equipment and double rent expense during the transition to the new facility we expect to incur additional headquarter relocation expense during the first half of 2012 

on october 25 2011 we announced restructuring plans to reduce our global workforce by approximately 200 employees or approximately 8 and to consolidate certain facilities as a result of the restructuring effort we recorded a restructuring charge of 81 million  during the fourth quarter of 2011 comprised primarily of severance pay and other employee separation costs we expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to this effort through the second quarter of 2012 

in addition on january 27 2012 ckh acquisition corp and roche holding ltd together “roche” made an unsolicited tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of our common stock for 4450 per share roche also announced that it intends to oppose the reelection of four directors serving on our board of directors whose terms expire at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders including the chairman of the board and our chief executive officer in connection with the roche tender offer four stockholder class action lawsuits have been filed against us and we anticipate that additional lawsuits may be filed as a result we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to increase during 2012 as we anticipate incurring significant legal advisory proxy solicitation and other costs as a result of this tender offer 

 

results of operations 

to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended january 1 2012  january 2 2011  and january 3 2010  stated as a percentage of total revenue 



our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 the years ended january 1 2012  january 2 2011  and january 3 2010  were 52 52 and 53 weeks respectively 

revenue 



product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments 

2011  compared to 2010   

consumables revenue increased 908 million or 18 to 5958 million in 2011 compared to 5050 million in 2010 the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of sequencing consumables which accounted for more than half of our consumables revenue in 2011 driven by growth in the installed base of our sequencing systems partially offset by a decrease in the consumable revenue per sequencing instrument 

instrument revenue increased 485 million or 15 to 3731 million in 2011 compared to 3246 million in 2010 the increase was primarily attributable to the launch of miseq in the third quarter of 2011 and higher hiseq revenue primarily 

driven by increased average selling price following completion of the genome analyzer tradein program during the first half of 2011 these increases in instrument revenue were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our genome analyzer from 2010 to 2011 as our genome analyzer customers upgraded to hiseq 2000 

revenue from hiseq 2000 sales in 2011 and 2010 was impacted by discounts provided to customers under our genome analyzer tradein program the estimated incremental sales incentive provided under this tradein program was approximately 111 million and 478 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively see “revenue recognition” in note “1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on the genome analyzer tradein program 

the increase in service and other revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily driven by an increase in our instrument service contract revenue resulting from our expanded installed base and an increase in sequencing services 

2010  compared to 2009   

consumable revenue increased 1137 million or 29 to 5050 million for 2010 compared to 3913 million for 2009 microarray consumable revenue which constituted more than half of our total consumable revenue in 2010 and 2009 increased 283 million primarily attributable to growth in sales of our infinium beadchips which constituted a majority of our microarray consumable sales sales volume of our infinium beadchip products increased on a per sample basis during 2010 compared to 2009 the average selling price per sample however declined due to a change in product mix primarily attributable to growth in sales of our focused content arrays and a number of large sample volume purchase orders that incurred higher discounts revenue from sequencing consumables increased 854 million due to growth in the installed base of our sequencing systems 

revenue from sales of instruments increased 989 million or 44 to 3246 million for 2010 compared to 2257 million for 2009 sequencing instrument revenue increased 857 million we experienced increases in both the number of units sold and average selling prices per unit for our sequencing systems during 2010 compared to 2009 unit growth was due to increased demand for nextgeneration sequencing systems the increase in average selling prices was primarily attributable to the launch of the hiseq 2000 in q1 2010 microarray instrument revenue increased 132 million primarily attributable to strong demand for our hiscansq instrument launched in 2010 the launch of this system resulted in increases in both the number of units sold and average selling prices per unit for our microarray instruments during 2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in service and other revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in instrument service contract revenue for our growing installed base of sequencing systems 

gross margin 



2011  compared to 2010    

gross margin increased in 2011 compared to 2010 during the period the gross margin of our instrument sales improved primarily driven by an increase in average selling price per instrument as our genome analyzer tradein program was substantially completed in the first half of 2011 the genome analyzer tradein program negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 11 and 53 in 2011 and 2010 respectively based on the estimated amount of incremental sales incentive provided the gross margin of our consumable sales also increased as we experienced a shift in sales mix from lower gross margin microarray consumables to higher gross margin sequencing consumables primarily due to the expansion of our sequencing instrument installed base the improvements in gross margins were partially offset by the negative impact from higher stock compensation expense and higher amortization expense of acquired intangible assets included in cost of revenue 

2010  compared to 2009   

the decrease in gross margin in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to the effect of discounts provided to customers on the sales of hiseq 2000 associated with promotional programs including the genome analyzer tradein program 

and lower margins on our newer products such as the hiseq 2000 based on the estimated amount of incremental sales incentive provided the genome analyzer tradein program negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 53 in 2010 see “revenue recognition” in note “1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on the genome analyzer tradein program the impact of the promotional programs was partially offset by improved margins on sequencing consumables primarily attributable to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes and the benefit of decreased costs associated with chemistry improvements 

operating expense 



2011  compared to 2010    

the increase in research and development expense in 2011 from 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expenses of 175 million associated with increased average headcount during 2011 and an increase of 29 million in research and development supplies personnel expenses included salaries sharebased compensation and benefits 

the increase in selling general and administrative expense in 2011 from 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expenses of 335 million associated with the growth of our business during the period the remaining increase was primarily driven by a 40 million increase in bad debt expenses as a result of customer bankruptcies and a 37 million increase in supplies repairs and maintenance expenses these increases were partially offset by a legal settlement gain of 23 million representing the payment we received to settle an outstanding commercial dispute 

in 2011 we relocated our headquarters to another facility in san diego california and incurred 418 million  in headquarter relocation expense which included a ceaseuse loss upon vacating our prior headquarters accelerated depreciation of certain property and equipment and double rent expense during the transition to the new facility 

in q4 2011 we announced a restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce by approximately 200 employees or approximately 8 and to consolidate certain facilities as a result of the restructuring effort we recorded a restructuring charge of 81 million  during q4 2011 comprised primarily of severance pay and other employee separation costs 

acquisition related expense net in 2011 included a 54 million charge of acquired inprocess research and development related to a milestone payment for a prior acquisition partially offset by 45 million gains related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration acquisition related gain net in 2010 included a gain of 104 million from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration related to an acquisition partially offset by an acquired inprocess research and development charge of 13 million related to a milestone payment made related to a prior acquisition 

  

2010  compared to 2009   

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a 259 million increase in personnel expenses including salaries noncash sharebased compensation and benefits and an increase in other nonpersonnel expenses of 133 million comprised mostly of lab and production supplies expenses these increases were primarily attributable to investments in new product development and commercialization along with projects to sustain and optimize our existing product portfolio 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a 318 million increase in personnel expenses including salaries noncash sharebased compensation and benefits associated with the growth of our business and an increase in outside service expenses of 97 million comprised mostly of legal and marketing expenses 

during 2009 acquisition related expense gain net included acquired inprocess research and development charges of 113 million related to milestone payments made to the former shareholders of the company we acquired prior to 2009 

other expense net 



2011  compared to 2010    

the decrease in interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily driven by lower interest rates despite the increase in our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balance during the period interest expense increased during the period primarily due to the accretion of discount on our 9200 million 025 convertible senior notes due 2016 issued in the first half of 2011 partially offset by the decrease in interest expense associated with the repayment of 3499 million  in principal for the 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 during 2011 

other expense income net in 2011 primarily consisted of a loss of 376 million on the extinguishment of debt recorded on conversions of our 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 and a 11 million foreign exchange loss recorded during the period other expense income net in 2010 primarily consisted of a 132 million impairment charge related to a costmethod investment and a related note receivable partially offset by a 29 million gain on acquisition recorded for the difference between the carrying value of a cost method investment prior to the acquisition and the fair value of that investment at the time of acquisition and foreign exchange gains 

2010  compared to 2009   

interest income decreased despite an increase in our average cash and investment balance due to an overall decline in interest rates during 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in interest expense was due to the accretion of discount on our 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 the change in other expense income net in 2009 primarily consisted of a gain of 08 million on the conversion of 100 million of our 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 and foreign exchange gains realized during the period

2011  compared to 2010    

the effective tax rate in 2011 closely approximated the us statutory rate because a significant portion of our earnings were subject to us taxation the increase in the effective tax rate in 2011 from 2010 was primarily attributable to lower nontaxable gains recorded on the changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions and higher nondeductible acquired iprd charges recorded in 2011 

2010  compared to 2009   

the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to the gain recorded on the change in the fair value of contingent consideration related to an acquisition that is excluded from taxable income and a decrease in nondeductible acquired iprd recognized for financial reporting purposes in 2010 as compared to 2009

liquidity 

we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of our liquidity our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs historically we have issued debt and equity securities to finance our requirements to the extent that cash provided by operating activities was not sufficient to fund our needs 

at january 1 2012 we had approximately 12 billion  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments our shortterm investments include marketable securities consisting of debt securities in government sponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury notes cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries at january 1 2012 were approximately 1781 million it is the companys intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

during the first half of 2011 we issued 9200 million in principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature march 15 2016 we pay 025 interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes payable semiannually in arrears in cash on march 15 and september 15 of each year in 2007 we issued 4000 million in principal of convertible senior notes that mature february 15 2014 we pay 0625 interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes payable semiannually in arrears in cash on february 15 and august 15 of each year additional information about the convertible notes including their conversion features is described in note “8 convertible senior notes” in part i item 1 of this form 10k as of january 1 2012 the principal amounts of our 025 convertible senior notes due 2016 and our 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 were 9200 million  and 401 million  respectively 

during 2011 we used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of our 025 convertible senior notes due 2016 for the extinguishment of 3499 million  principal amount of our existing 0625  convertible senior notes due 2014 upon conversion we will continue to use the net proceeds from the issuance of our 025 convertible senior notes due 2016 for future debt extinguishment in addition we used an additional 3143 million  of the net proceeds to purchase 49  million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the issuance we intend to use the remaining net proceeds for other general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions and additional purchases of our common stock 

our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include expenditures related to 

 

we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next 12 months barring unforeseen circumstances operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures at the present time we have no material commitments for capital expenditures our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes during the fiscal year ended january 1 2012 we were not involved in any “offbalance sheet arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the sec 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding the following table represents our contractual obligations as of january 1 2012 aggregated by type amounts in thousands 



 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1 organization and significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services instrument service contract sales and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgments and estimates and actual results may differ from our estimates 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met all revenue is recorded net of any discounts 

revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether refund rights exist if there are refund rights or payment terms based on future performance we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 

we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products or services these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame approximately three to six months of the contract execution date revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a standalone basis 

for transactions with multiple deliverables consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence exists we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 

in order to establish vsoe of selling price we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry we have rarely established selling price using thirdparty evidence if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

in the first quarter of 2010 we offered an incentive with the launch of the hiseq 2000 that enabled existing genome analyzer customers to trade in their genome analyzer and receive a discount on the purchase of a hiseq 2000 the incentive was limited to customers who had purchased a genome analyzer as of the date of the announcement and was the first significant tradein program we have offered the genome analyzer tradein program was completed in 2011 we accounted for hiseq 2000 discounts related to the genome analyzer tradein program as reductions to revenue upon recognition of the hiseq 2000 sales revenue which is later than the date the tradein program was launched 

in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region latin america the middle east and south africa the company sells products and provides services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products in most sales through distributors the product is delivered directly to customers in cases where the product is delivered to a distributor revenue 

recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor andor the enduser if required by the applicable sales contract the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers these transactions are accounted for in accordance with the companys revenue recognition policy described herein 

investments 

we invest in various types of securities including debt securities in government sponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury securities as of january 1 2012 we have 8866 million  in shortterm investments in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we classify our investments as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 

as noted in note 6 fair value measurements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level 2 these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly such as yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings and in the process we apply judgments and estimates that if changed could significantly affect our results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our gross trade accounts receivables totaled 1779 million  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was 40 million  at january 1 2012 our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at lower of cost or market we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycles quality issues historical experience and usage forecasts our gross inventory totaled 1433 million and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was 145 million at january 1 2012 historically our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses however if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

contingencies 

we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters we routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses to the extent losses are reasonably estimable if losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss disclosure for specific legal contingencies will be provided if the likelihood of occurrence is probable or reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to our consolidated financial statements management considers many factors in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters these factors include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes which may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of 

acquisition the fair values assigned defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets net of liabilities assumed as goodwill these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

in connection with certain of our acquisitions additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones in these cases a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable factors such as anticipated future cash flows riskfree adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related gain expense net a component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income this method requires significant management judgment including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 

management uses a discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our longlived assets are impaired a review of intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other longlived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment if indicators of impairment exist we assess the recoverability of the affected longlived assets by determining whether the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows associated with such assets 

in order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows the time value of money and other factors that a willing market participant would consider significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

sharebased compensation 

we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

the determination of fair value of sharebased awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected life of an award expected dividends and the riskfree interest rate we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally 

commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards we amortize the fair value of sharebased compensation on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly sharebased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

warranties 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on instruments additionally we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve and adjust if necessary the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 

ceaseuse loss upon exit of facility 

in 2011 we relocated our headquarters to a new facility in san diego california and recorded headquarter relocation expense of 418 million  which included a ceaseuse loss of 236 million  recorded upon vacating certain buildings of our prior headquarter facility the lease on our prior headquarter facility expires in 2023 the ceaseuse loss is calculated as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period adjusted for deferred items and leasehold improvements in calculating the ceaseuse loss management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and the riskadjusted discount rate these assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates resulting in significant adjustments to the ceaseuse loss recorded or to be recorded 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of the company’s future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies based on the available evidence as of january 1 2012 we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we recorded a valuation allowance of 18 million against certain us deferred tax assets 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company’s return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined

interest rate sensitivity 

our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments in addition if a 100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2012 our interest income would change by approximately 119 million  in relation to amounts we would expect to earn based on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of january 2 2011 

changes in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes   during 2011 we issued 920 million in aggregate principal amount of our 025 convertible senior notes due 2016 at our election the notes are convertible into cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in each case under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price for a sustained period at 130 above the conversion price of 8355  the notes will become convertible upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our thencurrent incremental borrowing rate if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted the implicit interest rate for the notes is 45 an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of 100 million aggregate principal amount of the notes would result in a loss of approximately 40 million 

market price sensitive instruments 

in order to reduce potential equity dilution in connection with the issuance and potential conversion of our 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 we entered into convertible note hedge transactions entitling us to purchase up to 18322320 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 2183 per share subject to adjustment in addition we sold to the hedge transaction counterparties warrants exercisable on a netshare basis for up to 18322320 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 31435 per share subject to adjustment the antidilutive effect of the note hedge transactions if any could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants which occur during 2014 assuming the warrants are exercised 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the companys us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro yen british pound sterling australian dollar and singapore dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income we recorded an immaterial net currency exchange loss for the fiscal year ended january 1 2012  and a gain of 10 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2011 on business transactions net of hedging transactions which are included in other expense income net in our consolidated statements of income 

we use forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities at january 1 2012  we had 255 million  of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge foreign currency risk

overview 

 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and marketer of life science tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function we were incorporated in california in april 1998 and reincorporated in delaware in july 2000 our principal executive offices are located at 9885 towne centre drive san diego california 92121 our telephone number is 858 2024500 

 

using our proprietary technologies we provide a comprehensive line of genetic analysis solutions with products and services that serve a broad range of highly interconnected markets including sequencing genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics our customers include leading genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics and consumer genomics companies 

 

our broad portfolio of systems consumables and analysis tools are designed to simplify genetic analysis this portfolio addresses a range of genomic complexity price points and throughputs enabling researchers to select the best solution for their scientific challenge in 2007 through our acquisition of solexa inc we acquired our proprietary sequencing by synthesis sbs technology that is at the heart of our leadingedge sequencing instruments these systems can be used to efficiently perform a range of nucleic acid dna rna analyses on large numbers of samples for more focused studies our arraybased solutions provide ideal tools to perform genomewide association studies gwas involving singlenucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping and copy number variation cnv analyses as well as gene expression profiling and other dna rna and protein studies to further enhance our genetic analysis workflows in january 2011 we acquired epicentre technologies corporation a leading provider of nucleic acid sample preparation reagents and specialty enzymes for sequencing and microarray applications in 2010 through our acquisition of helixis inc we expanded our portfolio to include realtime polymerase chain reaction pcr one of the most widely used technologies in life sciences our new eco realtime pcr system provides researchers with an affordable fullfeatured system to perform targeted validation studies 

 

our operating structure is divided into two business segments the life sciences business unit and the diagnostics business unit during 2010 our diagnostics business unit had limited business activity and accordingly operating results for both units are reported on an aggregate basis as one operating segment at each reporting period end we will reassess our reportable operating segments particularly as we continue to develop our molecular diagnostics business 

 

industry background 

 

genetics primer 

 

the instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna with the complete set of dna for any organism referred to as its genome dna contains small regions called genes which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively these nucleotide bases are present in a precise order known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a partial copy of its dna sequence — called messenger rna mrna — is used as a template 

to direct the synthesis of a protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function the illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic 

 

 

variations among organisms are due in large part to differences in their dna sequences changes caused by insertions deletions inversions or duplications of nucleotide bases may result in certain genes becoming overexpressed excessive protein production underexpressed reduced protein production or silenced altogether sometimes triggering changes in cellular function these changes can be the result of heredity but most often occur at random the most common form of variation in humans is called a singlenucleotide polymorphism snp which is a variation in a single position of a nucleotide base in a dna sequence copy number variations cnvs occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes 

 

in humans genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see height hair eye color etc more importantly these genetic variations can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease they can also impact an individual’s response to certain drug treatments causing them to respond well not respond at all or experience adverse side effects — an area of study known as pharmacogenomics 

 

scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans as well as a broad range of animals plants and microorganisms researchers investigating human viral and bacterial genetic variation are helping us to better understand the mechanisms of disease and develop more effective therapeutics and diagnostics greater insight into genetic variation in plants eg food and biofuel crops and animals eg livestock and domestic animals is enabling scientists to improve crop yields and animal breeding programs 

 

the methods for studying genetic variation and biological function include sequencing snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression profiling and gene regulation analysis each of which is addressed by our breadth of products and services 

 

life sciences research primer 

 

life science research encompasses the study of all living things from humans animals and plants to viruses and bacteria it is being performed in government university pharmaceutical biotechnology and agrigenomics laboratories around the world where scientists are seeking to expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life beginning at the genetic level where our tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes life science research expands to include the study of the cells tissues organs systems and other components that make up living organisms this research 

supports development of new more effective clinical diagnostics and medicines to improve human health as well as advances in agriculture and animal husbandry to meet the world’s growing needs for food and energy 

 

molecular diagnostics primer 

 

molecular diagnostic assays or tests are designed to identify the biological indicators linked with disease and drug metabolism providing physicians with information to more effectively diagnose treat and monitor both acute and chronic disease conditions they are an integral part of personalized healthcare where the unique makeup of each individual will be taken into account in diagnosing disease and managing treatment through the use of more tailored therapies biological indicators that can be measured by these assays include protein or gene expression methylation levels copy number variations and the presence or absence of a specific gene or group of genes 

 

there are molecular diagnostic assays on the market for infectious disease cancer and heart disease as well as molecularbased drug metabolism assays to help physicians select the most effective therapy with the fewest side effects our innovative technologies and products are contributing to the development of a widerange of potential molecular diagnostic assays our own efforts in this area are currently focused on the identification of certain genetic markers with potential diagnostic and therapeutic utility 

 

growing news coverage about the clinical relevance of newly discovered genetic markers has prompted consumers’ interest in having their personal genomes analyzed sparking the development of the consumer genomics market we believe there are distinct medical benefits especially for people with family histories of certain diseases of knowing your disease predisposition several companies including illumina now offer personal sequencing or genotyping services working with physician groups and genetic counselors to interpret the results for consumers 

 

we believe the growth in consumer genomics and the use of molecular diagnostic assays will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and the economics of the pharmaceutical industry by facilitating an increased emphasis on preventative and predictive molecular medicine ushering in the era of personalized medicine 

 

our principal markets 

 

from the company’s inception we have believed that the analysis of genetic variation and function will play an increasingly important role in molecular biology and that by empowering genetic analysis our tools will advance disease research drug development and the creation of molecular tests in addition to developing sequencing and arraybased solutions for life science applied and consumer genomics markets we are making inroads into the emerging market of molecular diagnostics 

 

life sciences research market 

 

the life sciences research market consists of laboratories generally associated with universities medical research centers government institutions as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions are using our products and services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities such as nextgeneration sequencing midtohighcomplexity genotyping and gene expression for wholegenome discovery and profiling and low complexity genotyping and gene expression for highthroughput targeted screening dna sequencing is growing the most rapidly among these three areas due to the creation of nextgeneration sequencing technologies such as sbs it is fueled by private and public funding new global initiatives to broadly characterize genetic variation and the migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencingbased technologies 

 

applied markets 

 

we provide products and services for various other markets which we refer to as “applied markets” the largest among these is the “agbio” market where government and corporate researchers use our sequencing and arraybased tools to accelerate and enhance agricultural research for example we currently offer 

microarrays that contain snps for custom and focused genotyping of seeds and crops such as maize and livestock such as cattle horses pigs and sheep customers use them to perform selective breeding accelerating and enhancing the process over traditional methods such as crossbreeding 

 

molecular diagnostics market 

 

molecular diagnostics makes up the fastest growing segment in the clinical diagnostics market with the primary growth drivers being the continued discovery of genetic markers with proven clinical utility the increasing adoption of geneticbased diagnostic tests and the expansion of reimbursement programs to include a greater number of approved molecular diagnostic tests we believe our beadxpress instrument platform using our veracode technology is ideally suited to provide a costeffective highthroughput mid to lowmultiplex solution to the molecular diagnostic market in april 2010 we obtained 510k approval for the beadxpress platform from the us food and drug administration fda we have initiated development of a variety of clinical diagnostic testing panels for this platform and are continuing research into the potential development of cancer diagnostic panels initially focusing on ovarian gastric and colorectal cancers during the fourth quarter of 2009 we made an fda preide investigational device exemption submission for a cytogenetics test intended to be used on our iscan instrument platform as an aid in the postnatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities known to be associated with developmental delay and mental retardation following completion of the required clinical trial we intend to seek fda clearance for the iscan instrument platform and related consumables 

 

consumer genomics markets 

 

new sequencing and genotyping technologies such as those developed by illumina are driving down the cost of performing analyses which are increasingly valuable in diagnosing disease and evaluating disease risk consumer genomics is a nascent market but one we believe has the potential for high growth as the cost per analysis continues to drop in june 2009 we launched our individual genome sequencing service the first physicianintermediated personal genome sequencing service for consumers built around physicianpatient consultation the service requires a physician’s order to initiate the process with genome sequencing performed using our cliacertified capaccredited laboratory we have established collaborations with partners to perform the secondary data analysis of a personal genome such as calculation of disease risk ancestry and information on traits of interest some of our partners as well as other companies in the directtoconsumer market use our genotyping technology and products to perform personal genotyping services 

 

our principal technologies 

 

our unique technology platforms enable the scale of experimentation necessary for genomewide discovery target selection and validation studies see figure 1 below more than 2500 customerauthored scientific publications have been published to date using these technologies representing the efforts of a large and dynamic illumina user community through rapid innovation we believe we are changing the economics of genetic research enabling projects once considered unapproachable to now be within reach of more investigators 

figure 1 illumina platform overview 

 

 

sequencing technology 

 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases a c g or t in a dna sample our hiseq 2000 hiseq 1000 genome analyzer iix and hiscansq systems represent a family of systems that we believe are setting the standard for productivity costeffectiveness and accuracy among nextgeneration sequencing technologies they are used by customers to perform wholegenome de novo and targeted resequencing of genomes and to analyze specific gene regions and genes in january 2011 we announced the miseq personal sequencing system which will expand our family of sequencing systems to include a lowcost personal sequencing system that will provide individual researchers a sequencing platform that can go from purified dna to analyzed data in as few as eight hours or can generate in excess of 1 gigabase gb per run in slightly over a day 

 

wholegenome sequencing determines an organism’s complete dna sequence in de novo sequencing the goal is to sequence a representative sample from a species never before sequenced in targeted resequencing a sequence of nucleotide bases is compared to a standard or reference sequence from a previously sequenced species to identify changes that reflect genetic variation understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between and within species furthers our understanding of the function of the structures encoded in the dna 

 

our dna sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminatorbased sequencing chemistry referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry in sbs single stranded dna is extended from a priming site one base at a time using reversible terminator nucleotides these are dna bases that can be added to a growing second strand but which initially cannot be further extended this means that at each cycle of the chemistry only one base can be added each base that is added includes a fluorescent label that is specific to the particular base a c g or t following incorporation the emitted light can be imaged to determine its color and thus determine the base once this is done an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the blocking group that had prevented further extension of the second 

strand this allows another base to be added and the cycle can then be repeated our technology is capable of generating over 600 billion bases of dna sequence from a single experiment with a single sample preparation key aspects of the sbs chemistry are the subject of significant intellectual property owned by us 

 

in our dna sequencing systems we apply the sbs biochemistry on microscopic clusters of dna each cluster starts as a single dna molecule fragment typically a few hundred bases long attached to the inside surface of a flow cell we then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create copies of each starting molecule as the copies are made they are covalently linked to the surface so they cannot diffuse away after a number of cycles of amplification each cluster might have approximately 1000 copies of the original starting molecule but still be only about a micron onemillionth of a meter in diameter by making so many copies the fluorescent signal from each cluster is significantly increased because the clusters are so small hundreds of millions of clusters can be independently formed inside a single flow cell this large number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of sbs biochemistry and fluorescent imaging sequence reads are analyzed using specially developed data analysis software 

 

with the ability to generate over 600 gb of dna sequence per run our sbs sequencing technology provides researchers with the broadest range of applications and the opportunity to sequence even large mammalian genomes in days rather than weeks or years since the launch of our first genome analyzer in 2007 our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a factor of 100 

 

beadarray technology 

 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously enabling largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique highthroughput cost effective and flexible manner the arrays manufactured using beadarray technology are imaged by our iscan and hiscansq systems for a broad range of dna and rna analysis applications including snp discovery snp genotyping cnv analysis gene expression analysis and methylation analysis 

 

our proprietary beadarray technology consists of microscopic silica beads each bead covered with hundreds of thousands of copies of oligonucleotides or oligos that act as the capture sequences in one of our assays we deploy our beadarray technology on beadchips silicon wafers the size of a microscope slide with varying numbers of sample sites per slide beadchips are chemically etched to create tens of millions of wells for each sample site 

 

we create unique bead pools or sensors for different dna and rna analysis applications by affixing thousands to millions of copies of a specific type of oligonucleotide molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make different batches of beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor to form an array a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells one bead per well because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called “decoding” to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we employ several proprietary methods for decoding which is a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a functional validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each bead type multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads 

 

an experiment is performed by preparing a sample such as dna and introducing it to the array the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated beads the molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with fluorescent dye either before or after the binding which can be detected by shining a laser on the beadchip this allows the detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

using our beadarray technology we achieve highthroughput analysis with a high density of test sites per array and are able to format arrays in various configurations we seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive consumables and valuable samples and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments these features enable our beadarray technology to be applied to highgrowth markets of snp genotyping and cnv analysis and have allowed us to be a key player in the gene expression market 

 

veracode technology 

 

our proprietary veracode technology is a detection method for multiplex assays that require high precision accuracy and speed when deployed on our beadxpress reader system veracode technology provides a highthroughput solution for biomarker research and validation pharmaceutical development industrial and agriculture testing clinical research forensics and molecular diagnostic assay development 

 

the veracode technology platform leverages the power of digital holographic codes to provide a detection method for multiplex assays veracode enables lowcost multiplexing from 1 to 384plex in a single well the veracode technology consists of cylindrical glass beads measuring 240 microns in length by 28 microns in diameter inscribed with a unique digital holographic code to designate and track the specific analyte or genotype of interest throughout the multiplex reaction when excited by a laser each veracode bead emits a unique code image allowing for quick and specific detection by the beadxpress reader system 

 

depending on the desired multiplex levels assays are created by pooling microbeads with code diversities from one to several hundred unlike traditional microarrays the veracode microbeads are used in solution which takes advantage of solutionphase kinetics for more rapid hybridization times dramatically reducing the time to achieve results 

 

in december 2009 we began offering veracode universal capture and carboxyl beads as general purpose reagents gprs these royaltyfree veracode gpr beads provide customers with a flexible highquality costeffective multiplexing platform to develop their own custom multiplex assays for genotyping cnv gene expression methylation and protein analysis studies 

 

eco realtime pcr technology 

 

in april 2010 we purchased helixis inc and its novel realtime pcr technology and in july 2010 introduced the eco realtime pcr system to the market realtime pcr also known as quantitative pcr or qpcr is used to amplify and simultaneously quantify a targeted dna molecule with applications in gene expression viral quantification array data validation pathogen detection and genotyping the procedure follows the same steps as pcr whereby thermal cycling alternately heating and cooling the dna sample from 20 to 40 times causes the dna to selfreplicate resulting in the doubling of dna product with each cycle realtime pcr uses various fluorescent detection chemistries to enable the monitoring of the pcr reaction as it progresses data are collected at each cycle rather than at the end of the reaction providing higher precision increased sensitivity increased dynamic range and higher resolution 

 

the eco system combines a proprietary thermal system fourcolor multiplex capabilities and a finetuned optical system to deliver accurate qpcr results its unique design provides superior thermal uniformity supporting highquality pcr performance for demanding applications such as high resolution melt hrm curve analysis used for snp genotyping dna fingerprinting species identification hla compatibility typing allelic prevalence and dna methylation analysis measuring just over one cubic foot in size we believe the eco system’s overall performance rivals larger more expensive systems and provides us with a highly differentiated entry into this market 

our products 

 

using our proprietary technologies our products give our customers the ability to analyze the genome at any level of complexity from wholegenome sequencing to lowmultiplex assays and enable us to serve a number of markets including research agriculture forensics pharmaceuticals and molecular diagnostics

our research and development expenses for 2010 2009 and 2008 inclusive of charges relating to sharebased compensation of 254 million 200 million and 141 million respectively were 1779 million 1406 million and 1000 million respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2011 as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts 

 

marketing and distribution 

 

our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and animal and agricultural research our potential customers include leading genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics and consumer genomics companies the genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will ultimately be driven by among other items 

 

  

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe latin america and the asiapacific region in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in addition in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region latin america the middle east and south africa we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products we expect to continue to increase our sales and distribution resources during 2011 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products 

 

manufacturing 

 

we manufacture sequencing and array platforms reagent kits scanning equipment and oligos our manufacturing capacity for consumables and instruments has grown during 2010 to support our increased 

customer demand we are also focused on continuing to enhance the quality and manufacturing yield of our beadchips and flow cells in particular to continue to increase throughput and improve the quality and manufacturing yield as we increase the complexity of our products we are exploring ways to continue increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances 

 

raw materials 

 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies we have multiple commercial sources for many of our components and supplies however there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from single source suppliers to mitigate potential risks arising from single source suppliers we believe that we can redesign our products for alternative components or use alternative reagents if required in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain 

 

competition 

 

although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect to continue to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets these include companies such as affymetrix inc agilent technologies inc beckman coulter inc complete genomics inc helicos biosciences corporation general electric company life technologies corporation luminex corporation pacific biosciences of california inc qiagen nv roche diagnostics corp and sequenom inc among others some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over competing products 

 

segment and geographic information 

 

we are organized in two business segments life sciences and diagnostics our life sciences business unit includes all products and services related to the research market namely the product lines based on our sequencing beadarray veracode and realtime pcr technologies our diagnostics business unit focuses on the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics during all periods presented our diagnostics business unit had limited activity accordingly our operating results for both units are reported on an aggregate basis as one operating segment we will begin reporting in two segments once revenues operating profit or loss or assets of the diagnostics business unit exceed 10 of the consolidated amounts 

 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 4038 million or 45 of our total revenue during 2010 compared to 3191 million or 48 and 2932 million or 51 in 2009 and 2008 respectively sales to customers outside of the united states were generally denominated in us dollars in 2008 we reorganized our international structure to establish more efficient channels among product development product manufacturing and sales the reorganization increased our foreign subsidiaries’ anticipated dependence on the us entity for management decisions financial support production assets and inventory thereby making the foreign subsidiaries more of a direct and integral component of the us entity’s operations as a result we reassessed the primary economic environment of our foreign subsidiaries and determined the subsidiaries are more us dollar based resulting in a us dollar functional currency determination we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note “13 segment information 

geographic data and significant customers” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog was 2990 million and 2276 million at january 2 2011 and january 3 2010 respectively generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom we expect an estimated 90 of the backlog as of january 2 2011 to be shipped within the fiscal year ending january 1 2012 although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue even after title transfer depending on the specific arrangement with a customer and the applicable accounting treatment a material portion of our backlog at january 2 2011 is associated with a large order we received from one customer at the end of 2009 for which we are using operating lease accounting that requires us to recognize revenue over a period of three years with the majority of that revenue recognized in 2011 and 2012 

 

seasonality 

 

historically customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation although demand for our products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as a result in part of us academic customers spending unused budget allocations before the end of the us government’s fiscal year on september 30 of each year 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

 

government regulation 

 

our products are not currently subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as molecular diagnostic products regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will be a significant factor in the development testing production and marketing of such products products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use will be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

 

the shorter 510k clearance process which generally takes from three to six months after submission but can take significantly longer may be utilized if it is demonstrated that the new product is “substantially equivalent” to a similar product that has already been cleared by the fda the longer pma process is much more costly uncertain and generally takes from nine months to two years after filing because we cannot ensure that any molecular diagnostic products that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process or will ultimately be approved at all the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed and may be significantly more expensive than anticipated if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we 

develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

 

in addition the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture market and sell our existing and future products that are intended for and marketed and labeled as “research use only” or ruo is uncertain if such products are used or could be used even without our consent for the diagnosis of disease if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

employees 

 

as of january 2 2011 we had approximately 2100 employees none of our employees is represented by a labor union we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

 

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 

 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a widerange of competing technologies we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

 

the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 

 

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences agricultural and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and 

biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information for instance demand for our microarray products may be adversely affected if researchers fail to find meaningful correlations between genetic variation such as snps and disease susceptibility through genome wide association studies in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to sustain profitability 

 

if the quality of our products does not meet our customers’ expectations then our reputation could suffer and ultimately our sales and operating earnings could be negatively impacted 

 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products because our instruments and consumables are highly complex the occurrence of defects may increase as we continue to introduce new products and services and as we rapidly scale up manufacturing to meet increased demand for our products and services although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities in addition identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and thirdparty components may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with for example shipment holds product recalls and warranty or other service obligations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new products 

 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on continuously developing and commercializing new products and services including improving our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to successfully develop and introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products we cannot ensure that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace 

achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

 

  

we may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace 

 

if we do not successfully manage the development and launch of new products or services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely affected 

 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle we may delay our product launch date in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions or transition requirements or programs such as tradein programs with respect to newly launched products or products in development relative to our existing products which could adversely affect sales of our existing products the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue 

 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics and consumer genomics companies and their capital spending budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services these budgets are based on a wide variety of factors including the allocation of available resources to make purchases funding from government sources the spending priorities among various types of research equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary periods any decrease in capital spending or change in spending priorities of our customers could significantly reduce our revenue moreover we have no control over the timing and amount of purchases by our customers and as a result revenue from these sources may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast any delay or reduction in purchases by our customers or our inability to forecast fluctuations in demand could harm our future operating results 

 

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for components and materials used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the components or materials supplied do not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

the complex nature of our products requires customized precisionmanufactured components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some components 

and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these components or materials timely or in sufficient quantities or qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and we cannot ensure that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms in addition the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier the time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields any of which would negatively impact our operating results accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

we continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our business plan for 2011 there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments consumables and products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

 

additionally we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and hayward california singapore and little chesterford united kingdom these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products 

 

also many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies 

 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve 

numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

  

in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies we cannot ensure that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

 

the timing and extent of funding provided by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the recovery act could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

the recovery act was enacted in february 2009 to provide stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the economic downturn as part of the recovery act legislation over 10 billion in funding was provided to the national institute of health to support the advancement of scientific research a portion of the stimulus funding may support the analysis of genetic variation and biological function and have a significant positive impact on our business if our customers are unable to obtain stimulus money they may reduce their research and development budgets resulting in a decrease in demand for our products in addition it is unclear what will happen to demand for our products after the stimulus funds from the recovery act have been allocated and spent a decline in demand will reduce our revenues which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets the recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets a severe or prolonged economic downturn such as the recent global financial crisis could result in a variety of risks to our business including in particular reductions or delays in planned improvements to healthcare systems research and development funding and purchases of our products and 

services or costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the liquidity of our investment portfolio could be impaired such as when more than 50 million of auction rate securities that we held for investment became illiquid in february 2008 because their scheduled auctions failed furthermore as is the case for almost any other business we face the following risks from a severe or prolonged economic downturn 

 

  

in addition certain of our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us if that were to occur our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding could increase additionally these economic conditions may cause our smaller suppliers to be unable to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized components which would impair our ability to manufacture on schedule and at commercially reasonable costs suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 

 

an inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our operations could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our business has grown rapidly with total revenues increasing from 735 million for the year ended january 1 2006 to 9027 million for the year ended january 2 2011 and with the number of employees increasing from approximately 375 to approximately 2100 during the same period we expect to continue to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans the rapid expansion of our business and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our management and operational systems our ability to effectively manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a global basis if we are unable to scaleup and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement and improve our research product development manufacturing sales and marketing and customer support programs enhance our operational and financial control systems expand train and manage our employee base integrate acquired businesses and effectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

 

we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our 

products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use stock options and restricted stock units to provide incentives for our key personnel to remain with us and to align their interests with those of the company by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay 

 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position 

 

our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

 

the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our patent position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets in addition certain patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued questions as to inventorship or ownership may also arise any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies also our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 

 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information among other things we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants there can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements that we have with our employees collaborators and consultants will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and confidential information or will provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information accordingly there also can be no assurance that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

litigation other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services 

 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products or services and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products or services in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

 

doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our business 

 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe the asiapacific region and brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom and singapore during 2010 the majority of our sales to international customers and purchases of raw materials from international suppliers were denominated in us dollars shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 45 48 and 51 of our total revenue for the years ended january 2 2011 january 3 2010 and december 28 2008 respectively we intend to continue to expand our international presence by selling to customers located outside of the united states and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow 

 

international sales entail a variety of risks including 

 

 24 

 

changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations the recent global financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax laws or tax rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if the irs or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company on its tax returns we could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if material payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

 

in addition we could lose some or all of the tax deduction for interest expense associated with our 390 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2014 if these notes are not subject to the special treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments the notes are converted or we invest in nontaxable investments 

 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

 

our products are not currently subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease certain of our products are likely to become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable agencies of other countries including requirements for regulatory approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

 

molecular diagnostic products in particular depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance from the fda following a premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture market and sell our existing and future products that are intended for and marketed and labeled as “research use only” or ruo is uncertain if such products are used or could be used even without our consent for the diagnosis of disease if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be able to sustain operating profitability 

 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform the timing of our customers’ funding changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final week of the quarter in light of that our revenue cutoff and recognition procedures together with our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter 

 

a large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash sharebased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products or services 

 

our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops and other living organisms the information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information including the genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

the relocation of our corporate headquarters which is expected to begin in late 2011 could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we entered into a lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters to meet our current and longterm expansion needs we expect to begin relocating most of our san diegobased operations to this new facility in late 2011 in addition to incurring a onetime noncash charge of approximately 30 million related to the remaining lease obligations for our current corporate headquarters we expect to incur additional expenses associated with the relocation itself although we expect to sublease our current corporate headquarters we will continue to be subject to rent and lease obligations for our current facility through october 2023 additional risks associated with the relocation including in particular the relocation of oligo manufacturing that currently takes place at our corporate headquarters may include delays in receiving necessary permits and approvals and business disruption as complex manufacturing equipment is moved 

 

our strategic equity investments may result in losses 

 

we periodically make strategic equity investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business the market values of these strategic equity investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control otherthantemporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses in proportion to our ownership interest this could result in future charges to our earnings it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any longterm benefits associated with these strategic investments 

 

conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses 

 

as of january 2 2011 we had 3900 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of 2183 per share we expect that noteholders will elect to convert the notes upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 827 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted

certain statements set forth below constitute forwardlooking statements see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for additional factors relating to such statements and see “risk factors” in item 1a of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

business overview 

 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and marketer of life science tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function using our proprietary technologies we provide a comprehensive line of genetic analysis solutions with products and services that serve a broad range of highly interconnected markets including sequencing genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics our customers include 

leading genomic research centers academic institutions government laboratories and clinical research organizations as well as pharmaceutical biotechnology agrigenomics and consumer genomics companies 

 

our broad portfolio of systems consumables and analysis tools are designed to simplify genetic analysis this portfolio addresses the range of genomic complexity price points and throughputs enabling researchers to select the best solution for their scientific challenge in 2007 through our acquisition of solexa inc we acquired our proprietary sequencing by synthesis sbs technology that is at the heart of our leadingedge sequencing instruments these systems can be used to efficiently perform a range of nucleic acid dna rna analyses on large numbers of samples for more focused studies our arraybased solutions provide ideal tools to perform genomewide association studies gwas involving singlenucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping and copy number variation cnv analyses as well as gene expression profiling and other dna rna and protein studies to further enhance our genetic analysis workflows in january 2011 we acquired epicentre technologies corporation a leading provider of nucleic acid sample preparation reagents and specialty enzymes for sequencing and microarray applications in 2010 through our acquisition of helixis inc we expanded our portfolio to include realtime polymerase chain reaction pcr one of the most widely used technologies in life sciences our new eco realtime pcr system provides researchers with an affordable fullfeatured system to perform targeted validation studies 

 

we are organized in two business segments the life sciences business unit and the diagnostics business unit during 2010 our diagnostics business unit had limited business activity and accordingly operating results are reported on an aggregate basis as one operating segment at each reporting period end we reassess our reportable operating segments particularly as we continue to develop our molecular diagnostics business 

 

our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be useful for understanding the relevant trends going forward however this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item 8 of this report 

 

business trends and outlook 

 

our financial results have been and will continue to be impacted by several significant trends which are described below while these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results the other transactions events and trends discussed in “risk factors” in item 1a of this report may also materially impact our business operations and financial results 

 

nextgeneration sequencing 

 

growth in the sequencing market and enhancements in our product portfolio continue to drive both sequencing instrument and consumable sales in q1 2010 we began customer shipments of the hiseq 2000 our newest highthroughput nextgeneration sequencing instrument the hiseq 2000 was developed over a threeyear period and is designed to provide ultrahigh sequencing throughput that will significantly lower the cost of sequencing as a result of the launch a substantial number of our customers who previously purchased the genome analyzer sequencing system ordered the hiseq 2000 to replace their existing sequencer with this new system as a result of strong demand both from customers who desired to tradein their existing genome analyzers and new customers who ordered the hiseq 2000 our manufacturing capacity was constrained throughout all of 2010 during the year we significantly increased our manufacturing capacity for the hiseq 2000 to meet growing demand we now believe that we have increased our capacity to the point where we can begin reducing our backlog and fulfilling new orders in a more timely manner additionally in the first half of 2011 we expect to further enhance the performance of the hiseq 2000 we believe that these enhancements will enable customers to sequence whole human genomes for less than 5000 in consumable costs as we continue to make improvements that reduce the cost of sequencing we believe that more customers will use the hiseq 2000 which generates more revenue per instrument time than the genome analyzer we believe that this will increase our consumable pullthrough which is a measure of the annual consumable revenue generated from each instrument in the installed base 

in q4 2011 we expect to begin volume customer shipments of our recently announced miseq a lowcost personal sequencing system that we believe will provide individual researchers a platform with rapid turnaround time high accuracy and streamlined workflow we believe the launch of the miseq will expand our presence in the lower throughput sequencing market 

 

microarrays 

 

as a complement to advances in sequencing technology we believe microarrays offer a cheaper faster and more accurate technology for use when genetic content is known the information content of microarrays is fixed and reproducible as such microarrays provide repeatable standardized assays for certain subsets of nucleotide bases within the overall genome during 2010 microarray product sales increased as compared to 2009 led by 

 

  

as additional new rare variant content becomes available from the 1000 genomes project an international research effort launched in 2008 to establish the most detailed catalog of human genetic variation we plan to launch a microarray that will feature approximately five million markers per sample we expect to begin customer shipments of this product in mid2011 however the launch of this product will depend on the timing of the release of new content from the 1000 genomes project we believe new product introductions as new content becomes available will continue to drive growth in the sales of our microarray products 

 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the recovery act 

 

the recovery act was enacted in february 2009 to provide stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the economic downturn as part of the recovery act legislation over 100 billion in funding was provided to the national institutes of health nih to support the advancement of scientific research while it is not possible to precisely quantify the net impact of orders resulting from the recovery act due to the uncertainty surrounding orders that would have been received in absence of stimulus we believe approximately 704 million in orders during 2010 were directly related to recovery act grants we believe recovery act funds will continue to be spent by our customers through 2012 

 

gross margin 

 

our gross profit as a percentage of revenue gross margin decreased during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to the effects of discounts provided to customers on the sales of hiseq 2000s associated with promotional programs including the genome analyzer tradein program and lower margins on our newer products such as the hiseq 2000 over the course of 2011 we expect our gross margin to improve as the genome analyzer tradein program is completed and sales of consumables which generally carry a higher gross margin than instruments increase as a percentage of total revenue we also expect improved manufacturing efficiency for the hiseq 2000 to improve gross margin in 2011 

 

operating expense 

 

we expect to incur additional operating costs to support the expected growth in our business we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remain competitive and expand into additional markets accordingly we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our product base selling general and administrative expenses are also 

expected to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in staff and infrastructure to support top line growth and global expansion 

 

income taxes 

 

the provision for income taxes is dependent on the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor “we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes” in item 1a of this form 10k for 2011 and beyond we anticipate increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions which may adversely impact the provision for income taxes 

 

due to the expected utilization of the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards and us federal research and development tax credit carryforwards we anticipate significant income tax payments in 2011 and beyond 

 

results of operations 

 

to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended january 2 2011 january 3 2010 and december 28 2008 stated as a percentage of total revenue

revenue 

 

 

 

revenue 

 

product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments 

 

consumable revenue increased 1137 million or 29 to 5050 million for 2010 compared to 3913 million for 2009 microarray consumable revenue which constituted more than half of our total consumable revenue increased 283 million primarily attributable to growth in sales of our infinium beadchips which constituted a majority of our microarray consumable sales sales volume of our infinium beadchip products increased on a per sample basis during 2010 compared to 2009 the average selling price per sample however declined due to a change in product mix primarily attributable to growth in sales of our focused content arrays and a number of large sample volume purchase orders that incurred higher discounts revenue from sequencing consumables increased 854 million due to growth in the installed base of our sequencing systems 

 

revenue from the sale of instruments increased 989 million or 44 to 3246 million for 2010 compared to 2257 million for 2009 sequencing instrument revenue increased 857 million we experienced increases in both the number of units sold and average selling prices per unit for our sequencing systems during 2010 compared to 2009 unit growth was due to increased demand for nextgeneration sequencing systems the increase in average selling prices was primarily attributable to the launch of the hiseq 2000 in q1 2010 microarray instrument revenue increased 132 million primarily attributable to strong demand for our hiscansq instrument launched in 2010 the launch of this system resulted in increases in both the number of units sold and average selling prices per unit for our microarray instruments during 2010 compared to 2009 

 

the increase in service and other revenue which includes extended warranty contracts and genotyping and sequencing services was primarily attributable to an increase in extended warranty contracts for our growing installed base of sequencing systems 

 

gross margin 

 

the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the effect of discounts provided to customers on the sales of hiseq 2000 associated with promotional programs including the genome analyzer tradein program and lower margins on our newer products such as the hiseq 2000 see “revenue recognition” in note “1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on the genome analyzer tradein program the impact of the promotional programs was partially offset by improved margins on sequencing consumables primarily attributable to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes and the benefit of decreased costs associated with chemistry improvements 

operating expense 

 

 

 

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a 259 million increase in personnel expenses including salaries noncash sharebased compensation and benefits and an increase in other nonpersonnel expenses of 133 million comprised mostly of lab and production supplies expenses these increases were primarily attributable to investments in new product development and commercialization along with projects to sustain and optimize our existing product portfolio 

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a 318 million increase in personnel expenses including salaries noncash sharebased compensation and benefits associated with the growth of our business and an increase in outside service expenses of 97 million comprised mostly of legal and marketing expenses 

 

during 2010 acquisition related gain expense net includes a gain of 104 million from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration related to an acquisition partially offset by an acquired inprocess research and development charge of 13 million related to a milestone payment made to the former shareholders of a company we acquired in 2008 during 2009 acquisition related gain expense net included acquired inprocess research and development charges of 113 million related to milestone payments made to the former shareholders of the company we acquired in 2008 

 

other expense net 

 

 

 

interest income decreased despite an increase in our average cash and investment balance due to an overall decline in interest rates during 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in interest expense was due to the amortization of the discount on our convertible senior notes the change in other expense income net was primarily attributable to a 132 million impairment charge recorded in q4 2010 related to the impairment of a costmethod investment and a related note receivable see note “5 impairment” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on this impairment partially offset by a 29 million gain recognized in q2 2010 on the acquisition of helixis inc which represented the difference between the carrying value of our costmethod investment in helixis inc prior to acquisition and the fair value of that investment at the time of acquisition 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the gain recorded on the change in the fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisition of helixis inc that is excluded from taxable income and a decrease in nondeductible acquired iprd recognized for financial reporting purposes in 2010 as compared to 2009 

 

comparison of 2009 and 2008 

 

our fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 the year ended january 3 2010 was 53 weeks and the year ended december 28 2008 was 52 weeks 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

revenue 

 

product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments 

 

consumable revenue increased 576 million or 17 to 3913 million for 2009 compared to 3337 million for 2008 microarray consumable revenue which constituted more than half of our consumable revenue declined 114 million primarily attributable to lower sales of wholegenome genotyping arrays partially offset by growth in focused content arrays the decline was driven by customers delaying the start of new gwas in anticipation of new and rare variant content from the 1000 genome project order delays directly related to stimulus funding under the recovery act and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers sales volume for our infinium beadchip product lines which constituted a majority of our microarray consumable sales was relatively flat on a sample basis during 2009 compared to 2008 the average selling price per sample however declined due to a change in product mix attributable to growth in the sales of our focused content arrays coupled with lower sales of wholegenome genotyping arrays 

 

revenue from sequencing consumables increased 689 million driven by growth in the installed base of our genome analyzer systems and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale the increase was partially offset by a loss of sales related to a quality issue affecting our pairedend cluster kits that arose in september 2009 when some of our larger sequencing customers began experiencing higher than average error rates on the second read of their pairedend analysis during the fourth quarter we began shipping reformulated pairedend cluster kits at full capacity and cleared the related shipping backlog 

 

revenue from the sale of instruments increased 400 million or 22 to 2257 million for 2009 compared to 1857 million for 2008 primarily due to a 564 million increase in sales of our sequencing systems during 2009 as compared to 2008 units sold and average selling prices increased for our genome analyzer systems which constituted a majority of sequencing instrument revenue the increase in units sold was driven by increased demand for nextgeneration sequencing systems the increase in average selling prices was attributable to the product transition from the genome analyzer i to the genome analyzer ii in the second quarter of 2008 and technological improvements leading to the launch of the genome analyzer iix in the second quarter of 2009 the increase in sequencing instrument revenue was partially offset by a 164 million decrease in the sales of our microarray systems which declined primarily due to customers delaying the start of new gwas in anticipation of new and rare variant content from the 1000 genomes project order delays directly related to stimulus funding under the recovery act and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers 

gross margin 

 

the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower costs for our sequencing consumables and instrumentation a 41 million impairment charge recorded in 2008 for which there was no similar charge recognized in 2009 and a 38 million decrease in amortization expense the gross margin on sequencing consumables increased primarily due to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes of sequencing consumables and the benefit of decreased costs associated with the reformulation of our sequencing kits launched at the end of the third quarter of 2008 the gross margin on sequencing instruments increased primarily due to production efficiencies and reduced material costs coupled with higher average selling prices 

 

operating expense 

 

 

 

the increase in research and development was primarily attributable to a 229 million increase in personnelrelated expenses including salaries noncash sharebased compensation and benefits a 104 million increase to nonpersonnel related expenses and an increase in outside services of 32 million attributable to consulting fees these increases were primarily related to the growth in our efforts to optimize and commercialize our sequencing and beadarray technologies 

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of 266 million in personnelrelated expenses associated with the growth of our business including salaries noncash sharebased compensation and benefits 

 

during 2009 acquisition related gain expense net includes iprd charges of 113 million related to milestone payments made to the former shareholders of a company we acquired in 2008 during 2008 acquisition related gain expense net includes iprd charges of 247 million as a result of the same acquisition 

 

other expense net 

 

 

 

interest income decreased despite an increase in our average cash and investment balance due to an overall decline in interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 interest expense increased due to the amortization of the discount on our convertible senior notes other income expense net decreased due to a decrease of 15 million in gains on net foreign currency transactions which was partially offset by a gain of 08 million on the conversion of a portion of our debt during the first quarter of 2009 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in nondeductible acquired iprd recognized for financial reporting purposes in 2009 compared to 2008 additionally the percentage of consolidated income before income taxes earned in foreign jurisdictions which primarily have lower statutory tax rates than the us statutory tax rate increased from 36 in 2008 to 43 in 2009 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flow summary 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities in 2010 consists of net income of 1249 million plus net noncash adjustments of 1498 million and a 21 million decrease in net operating assets the primary noncash expenses added back to net income included share based compensation of 716 million depreciation and amortization expenses related to property and equipment and intangible assets of 420 million and the amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes totaling 214 million the main drivers in the change in net operating assets included increases in accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and accrued liabilities these increases were primarily related to the growth of our business 

 

cash provided by operating activities in 2009 consists of net income of 723 million plus net noncash adjustments of 1157 million and an 158 million increase in net operating assets the primary noncash expenses added back to net income included share based compensation of 608 million and depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment intangibles and the debt discount on our convertible notes totaling 515 million 

 

investing activities 

 

cash used in investing activities totaled 2850 million in 2010 during the year we 

 

 39 

 

cash used in investing activities totaled 2566 million in 2009 we purchased and sold availableforsale securities totaling 6945 million and 5142 million respectively we incurred 527 million in capital expenditures primarily associated with the expansion of our facilities and infrastructure at our san diego hayward and uk locations 

 

financing activities 

 

cash provided by financing activities totaled 1165 million in 2010 we received 1180 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock through the exercise of stock options and warrants and under our employee stock purchase plan we also received 424 million in incremental tax benefit related to stock options exercised these increases were partially offset by common stock repurchases of 440 million 

 

cash used in financing activities totaled 989 million in 2009 during the year we repurchased approximately 61 million shares of our common stock for 1751 million which was partially offset by 394 million in proceeds received from issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and under our employee stock purchase plan we also received 393 million in incremental tax benefit related to stock options exercised 

 

liquidity 

 

we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of our liquidity our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs historically we have issued debt and equity securities to finance our requirements to the extent that cash provided by operating activities was not sufficient to fund our needs 

 

at january 2 2011 we had approximately 8943 million in cash and shortterm investments our shortterm investments include marketable securities consisting of debt securities in government sponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury notes 

 

on february 16 2007 we issued 4000 million in principal of convertible senior notes that mature february 15 2014 we pay 0625 interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes payable semiannually in arrears in cash on february 15 and august 15 of each year the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances as described in note “7 convertible senior notes” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k as of january 2 2011 the principal amount of the notes was 3900 million due to the conversion of 100 million of the notes during the first quarter of 2009 during the period from january 3 2011 to february 28 2011 certain noteholders notified us of their election to convert an aggregate of 2511 million principal amount of the notes see note “15 subsequent events” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on these conversions 

 

our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include expenditures related to 

 

  

we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

 

we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next 12 months barring unforeseen circumstances operating needs

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes during the fiscal year ended january 2 2011 we were not involved in any “offbalance sheet arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the sec 

 

contractual obligations 

 

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding the following table represents our contractual obligations as of january 2 2011 aggregated by type amounts in thousands

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1 organization and significant accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

revenue recognition 

 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services extended warranty sales and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgments and estimates and actual results may differ from our estimates 

 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met all revenue is recorded net of any discounts 

 

revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 

 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether refund rights exist if there are refund rights or payment terms based on future performance we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 

 

we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products or services these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame approximately three to six months of the contract execution date revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a standalone basis 

for transactions entered into in 2009 and 2010 consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence exists we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 

 

for transactions entered into prior to 2009 consideration was generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon its relative fair value when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for all units of accounting in an arrangement the fair value of an item was generally the price charged for the product if the item was regularly sold on a standalone basis in those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for the undelivered items but not for the delivered items the residual method was used to allocate the arrangement consideration under the residual method the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items when we were unable to establish standalone value for delivered items or when fair value of undelivered items had not been established revenue was deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been performed or until fair value could objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 

 

in order to establish vsoe of selling price we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry we have rarely established selling price using thirdparty evidence if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

 

in the first quarter of 2010 we offered an incentive with the launch of the hiseq 2000 that enabled existing genome analyzer customers to trade in their genome analyzer and receive a discount on the purchase of a hiseq 2000 the incentive was limited to customers who had purchased a genome analyzer as of the date of the announcement and was the first significant tradein program we have offered we will account for hiseq 2000 discounts related to the genome analyzer tradein program in the period in which the hiseq 2000 revenue is recognized 

 

investments 

 

we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs we use a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable to measure fair value 

 

 43 

 

in using this fair value hierarchy management may be required to make assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value these assumptions are judgmental in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers and we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycles quality issues historical experience and usage forecasts if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

 

contingencies 

 

we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters we routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses to the extent losses are reasonably estimable if losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is probable and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters management considers many factors these factors include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes which may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 

 

business combinations 

 

under the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the fair values assigned defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets net of liabilities assumed as goodwill these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

 

in connection with certain of our acquisitions additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones prior to fiscal year 2009 the company recognized contingent consideration as an additional element of the cost of the acquisition generally goodwill when the contingency was resolved beyond a reasonable doubt and the additional consideration was issued or became issuable due to changes in the accounting standards regarding business combinations for all acquisitions consummated on or after december 29 2008 a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing 

variable factors such as anticipated future cash flows riskfree adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related gain expense net a component of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income this method requires significant management judgment including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 

 

management uses a discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

 

intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

 

we estimate the fair value of intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 

 

in order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows the time value of money and other factors that a willing market participant would consider significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we had a total of 1299 million in net property and equipment and 700 million in net intangible assets on our balance sheet at january 2 2011 

 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

 

the determination of fair value of sharebased awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected life of an award expected dividends and the riskfree interest rate we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably 

expected to recur and other relevant factors implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards we amortize the fair value of sharebased compensation on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly sharebased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

 

income taxes 

 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the us and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of the company’s future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliable forecasting projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies based on the available evidence as of january 2 2011 we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we recorded a valuation allowance of 19 million and 31 million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets respectively 

 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company’s return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 

 

warranties 

 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on instruments additionally we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiry date which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve and adjust if necessary the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate sensitivity 

 

our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do 

not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments in addition if a 100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2011 our interest income would change by approximately 89 million in relation to amounts we would expect to earn based on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of january 2 2011 

 

changes in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes as of january 2 2011 we had 3900 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding the notes are convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock under certain circumstances including trading price conditions related to our common stock if the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of 2183 per share we expect that noteholders will elect to convert the notes upon conversion we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate the net carrying value of the notes has an implicit interest rate of 827 if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of 100 million aggregate principal amount of the notes would result in a loss of approximately 35 million 

 

market price sensitive instruments 

 

in order to reduce potential equity dilution in connection with the issuance and potential conversion of our convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions entitling us to purchase up to 18322320 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 2183 per share subject to adjustment in addition we sold to the hedge transaction counterparties warrants exercisable on a netshare basis for up to 18322320 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 31435 per share subject to adjustment the antidilutive effect of the note hedge transactions if any could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants which occur during 2014 assuming the warrants are exercised 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the entity’s us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro yen british pound sterling australian dollar and singapore dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income we recorded a net currency exchange gain on business transactions net of hedging transactions of 10 million for each of the years ended january 2 2011 and january 3 2010 which are included in other expense income net in the consolidated statements of income 

we use forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities at january 2 2011 we had 200 million of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge foreign currency risk

we design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that 1 our transactions are properly authorized 2 our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use and 3 our transactions are properly recorded and reported in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles we also maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and our established financial policies 

 

we have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the securities exchange act as of january 2 2011 based upon that evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of january 2 2011 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that a the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and b such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures our management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level because of inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues if any within a company have been detected 

 

an evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2010 and that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting the evaluation did not identify any such change 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

 

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control — integrated framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 2 2011 the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2011 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein

the board of directors and stockholders of 

illumina inc 

 

we have audited illumina inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2011 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria illumina inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion illumina inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2011 based on the coso criteria 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of illumina inc as of january 2 2011 and january 3 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended january 2 2011 of illumina inc and our report dated february 28 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

overview 

 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological function we were incorporated in california in april 1998 and reincorporated in delaware in july 2000 our principal executive offices are located at 9885 towne centre drive san diego california 92121 our telephone number is 858 2024500 

 

using our proprietary technologies we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing genotyping and gene expression markets and we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics our customers include leading genomic research centers pharmaceutical companies academic institutions clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies 

 

we develop and commercialize sequencing technologies used to perform a range of analyses including de novo sequencing whole genome resequencing gene expression analysis and small rna analysis our product and service offerings also include leadingedge solutions for singlenucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping copy number variation cnv dna methylation studies gene expression profiling and lowmultiplex analysis of dna rna and protein we believe we are the only company with genomescale technology for sequencing genotyping and gene expression — the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 

 

our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to determine and analyze the billions of bits of genetic information needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 

 

in 2007 we acquired solexa inc as a result of that transaction we acquired the sequencing technology utilized in our hiseq 2000 and genome analyzer instrument platforms these products perform dna sequencing based on a proprietary reversible terminator sequencingbysynthesis sbs chemistry 

 

during the first quarter of 2008 we reorganized our operating structure into two newlycreated business segments the life sciences business unit and the diagnostics business unit during 2009 the diagnostics business unit had limited business activity and accordingly operating results are reported on an aggregate basis as one operating segment in the future at each reporting period end we will reassess our reportable operating segments particularly as we enter the market for molecular diagnostics 

 

industry background 

 

dna rna and protein 

 

the genetic content that controls an organism’s living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid or dna the human body for instance is composed of billions of cells each containing dna which encodes the basic instructions for cellular function the complete set of an organism’s dna is called its genome the human genome is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes that are further divided into over 30000 smaller regions called genes each gene is comprised of a string of nucleotide bases labeled a c g and t representing adenine cytosine guanine and thymine respectively human dna has approximately 3 billion nucleotide bases and their precise order is known as the dna sequence when a gene is “expressed” a partial copy of its dna sequence — called messenger rna or mrna — is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a protein proteins in turn direct all cellular function

every person inherits two copies of each gene — one from each parent the two copies of each gene may be identical or they may be different these differences are referred to as genetic variation examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color genetic variation can also have important medical consequences genetic variation affects disease susceptibility including predisposition to cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease in addition genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug treatment some people may respond well others may not respond at all and still others may experience adverse side effects a common form of genetic variation is a snp a snp is a variation in a single position of a nucleotide base in a dna sequence it is estimated that the human genome contains over 30 million snps 

 

while in some cases a single snp will be responsible for medically important effects it is now believed that combinations of snps may contribute to the development of most common diseases since there are millions of snps it is important to investigate many representative wellchosen snps simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable information 

 

another contributor to disease is the over or underexpression of genes within an organism’s cells a very complex network of genes interacts to maintain health in complex organisms the challenge for scientists is to delineate the associated genes’ expression patterns and their relationship to disease historically this problem was addressed by investigating effects on a genebygene basis this is time consuming and difficulties exist when several pathways cannot be observed or “controlled” at the same time with the advent of microarray technology thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time 

 

there are multiple methods of studying genetic variation and biological function including sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling each of which is uniquely addressed in our breadth of products and services our broad portfolio of current products and services supports a range of applications from highest multiplexing for wholegenome discovery and profiling to midand lowmultiplexing options for highthroughput targeted screening furthermore our products and services support both the upstream discovery process and the downstream test development process in order to understand genetic variation at the dna rna and protein levels 

 

sequencing 

 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases a c g or t in a dna sample which can be further divided into de novo sequencing resequencing and tag sequencing in de novo sequencing the goal is to determine the sequence of a representative sample from a species never before sequenced understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between many species can help our understanding of the function of the protein structures encoded in the dna 

 

in resequencing the sequence of nucleotide bases is compared to a standard or reference sequence from a given species to identify changes that reflect genetic variation resequencing studies can be performed on a genomewide basis which is referred to as wholegenome resequencing or on targeted areas of the genome for example regions identified by genomewide association studies which is known as targeted resequencing this is an extremely comprehensive form of genetic analysis in which every base is characterized for possible mutations we believe that these underlying discoveries will likely feed the development of new array products for broader testing and biomarker validation 

 

in tag sequencing short sequences often representative of a larger molecule or genomic location are detected and counted in these applications the number of times that each tag is seen provides quantification of an underlying biological process as an example in digital gene expression one or more tag sequences may be analyzed for each expressed gene and the number of copies of these tags that are detected in an experiment is a measure of how actively that gene is being expressed in the tissue sample being analyzed similarly a tag sequencing approach known as chip sequencing is used to determine the locations and extent of protein and dna interactions throughout the genome 

snp genotyping 

 

snp genotyping is the process of determining which nucleotide base a c g or t is present at a particular site in the genome within any organism the most common use of snp genotyping is for genomewide association studies gwas to look for an association between dna sequence variants and a specific phenotype of interest this is commonly done by studying the dna of individuals that are affected by a common disease or that exhibit a specific trait against the dna of control individuals who do not have this disease or trait the use of snp genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual snp or a collection of snps requires the analysis of millions of snp genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease for example a single large study could involve genotyping more than 1000000 snps per sample in more than 1000 samples thus requiring one billion assays using previously available technologies this scale of snp genotyping was both impractical and prohibitively expensive 

 

largescale snp genotyping can be used in a variety of ways including studies designed to understand the genetic contributions to disease disease association studies genomics based drug development clinical trial analysis responders and nonresponders and adverse event profiles disease predisposition testing and disease diagnosis snp genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare for example in the development of plants and animals with commercially desirable characteristics these markets will require billions of snp genotyping assays annually 

 

gene expression profiling 

 

gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mrna the intermediary messenger between genes and proteins variation in gene expression can cause disease or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease by comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different environments such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified studies of this type often used in drug discovery require monitoring thousands and preferably tens of thousands of mrnas in large numbers of samples once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples for example within a clinical trial 

 

as gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more costeffective technologies 

 

molecular diagnostics 

 

molecular diagnostics is the process of examining nucleic acids including dna and rna and protein biomarkers to detect or identify infectious diseases genetic diseases and disorders human cancers and to help understand subjecttosubject genebased variation in the efficacy or safety of drug substances pharmacogenics as knowledge of the genome and its function continues to expand new medical and diagnostic applications are being developed molecular diagnostic tests can be used as diagnostic tools as well as in genetic disease susceptibility testing molecular diagnostic tests can also be used to identify a disease monitor its progression and response to treatment or predict individual predisposition to a disease and individual response to treatment by identifying small individual genetic differences — or variants — that lie at the root of differing drug responses molecular diagnostic tests can be used to select appropriate medication and dosage 

 

our principal markets 

 

from our inception we have believed that the analysis of genetic variation and function will play an increasingly important role in molecular biology and that by empowering genetic analysis our tools will further disease research drug development and the development of molecular tests our customers include leading genomic research centers academic institutions clinical research organizations and pharmaceutical 

and biotechnology companies in addition fundamental developments in recent years have created significant new opportunities for us in the emerging market of molecular diagnostics 

 

life sciences research market 

 

the life sciences research market consists of laboratories generally associated with universities medical research centers government institutions such as the united states national institutes of health and other research institutions as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies researchers at these institutions are using our products and services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities such as nextgeneration sequencing midtohighcomplexity genotyping and gene expression for wholegenome discovery and profiling and low complexity genotyping and gene expression for highthroughput targeted screening nextgeneration sequencing is the most rapidly growing of these three areas it is fueled by private and public funding new global initiatives to broadly characterize genetic variation and the migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencing based technologies 

 

applied markets 

 

we provide products and services to enable or improve activities in particular markets which we refer to as applied markets a current focus of our products for these markets is in the area of agricultural research including microarrays that contain snps for custom and focused genotyping of seeds and crops such as maize and livestock such as cattle horses pigs and sheep the applied markets may also include opportunities for our products and services in the fields of forensic analysis veterinary diagnostics cytogenics retail pet genomics and consumer genotyping and sequencing in july 2009 we launched a service program to provide highquality personal genome sequencing for consumers in connection with our personal sequencing service we collaborate with a number of partners including 23andme inc decode genetics ehf knome inc national center for genome resources navigenics inc and pathway genomics to encourage secondary data analysis of a personal genome such as calculation of disease risk ancestry and information on traits of interest although we do not perform personal genotyping directly as a service several companies use our technology and products to provide personal genotyping services 

 

molecular diagnostics market 

 

the primary growth drivers in the molecular diagnostics market are the continued discovery of genetic markers with proven clinical utility the increasing adoption of genetic based diagnostic tests and the expansion of reimbursement programs to include a greater number of approved diagnostic tests we believe that molecular diagnostic tests will create a fundamental shift in both the practice of medicine and the economics of the pharmaceutical industry by creating an increased emphasis on preventative and predictive molecular medicine physicians will be able to use these tests for the early detection of disease and to treat patients on a personalized basis allowing them to select the most effective therapy with the fewest side effects we believe our beadxpress instrument platform using our veracode technology is ideally suited to provide a costeffective highthroughput mid to lowmultiplex solution to the molecular diagnostic market during the third quarter of 2009 we submitted our beadxpress instrument platform for review by the us food and drug administration fda assuming fda approval of this instrument platform we plan to develop clinical diagnostic testing panels for use on the beadxpress instrument platform including possible panels for multidrug resistant organisms herpes and respiratory viruses and we expect to continue research into the potential development of cancer diagnostic panels initially focusing on ovarian cancer and gastric cancer in addition during the fourth quarter of 2009 we made a preide investigational device exemption submission with the fda for a cytogenetics test intended to be used as an aid in the postnatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities known to be associated with developmental delay and mental retardation the preide package included our iscan instrument platform together with associated microarrays reagents and software following completion of the ide process we intend to seek fda clearance for the iscan instrument platform and related reagents 

our principal technologies 

 

sequencing technology 

 

our dna sequencing technology is based on the use of our proprietary sbs biochemistry in sbs single stranded dna is extended from a priming site one base at a time using reversible terminator nucleotides these are dna bases that can be added to a growing second strand but which initially cannot be further extended this means that at each cycle of the chemistry only one base can be added each base that is added includes a fluorescent label that is specific to the particular base a c g or t thus following incorporation the fluorescence can be imaged its color determined and the base itself can be inferred once this is done an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the blocking group that had prevented further extension of the second strand this allows another base to be added and the cycle can then be repeated our technology is capable of generating over 100 billion bases of dna sequence from a single experiment with a single sample preparation the reversible terminator bases that we use are novel synthetic molecules that we manufacture they are not well incorporated by naturally occurring polymerases so we have also developed proprietary polymerase enzymes for this purpose both the nucleotides and enzymes are the subject of significant intellectual property owned by us 

 

in our dna sequencing systems we apply the sbs biochemistry on microscopic islands of dna referred to as dna clusters each cluster starts as a single dna molecule fragment typically a few hundred bases long attached to the inside surface of a flow cell we then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create copies of each starting molecule as the copies are made they are covalently linked to the surface so they cannot diffuse away after a number of cycles of amplification each cluster might have approximately 1000 copies of the original starting molecule but still be only about a micron onemillionth of a meter in diameter by making so many copies the fluorescent signal from each cluster is significantly increased because the clusters are so small hundreds of millions of clusters can be independently formed inside a single flow cell this large number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of sbs biochemistry and fluorescent imaging sequence reads are aligned against a reference genome and genetic differences are called using specially developed data analysis software 

 

beadarray technology 

 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously enabling largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique highthroughput cost effective and flexible manner we achieve highthroughput with a high density of test sites per array and we are able to format arrays in various configurations in the format of standard microscope slides we seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools or sensors for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments we believe that these features have enabled our beadarray technology to become a leading platform for the highgrowth market of snp genotyping and have allowed us to be a key player in the gene expression market 

 

our proprietary beadarray technology consists of 2micron silica beads that selfassemble into microwells etched into an array substrate we have deployed our beadarray technology in two different array formats the array matrix and the beadchip our first bead based product was the array matrix which incorporates fiber optic bundles comprised of approximately 50000 individual fibers with 96 of these bundles placed into an aluminum plate to form an array matrix in late 2009 we announced that during 2010 we would no longer sell array matrix products and would instead deploy our beadarray technology only on beadchips beadchips are microscope slidesize silicon wafers with varying numbers of sample sites per slide beadchips are chemically etched to create tens of millions of wells for each sample site 

 

in a separate process we create sensors by affixing hundreds of thousands of copies of a specific type of oligonucleotide molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make different batches of 

beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor 

 

to form an array a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells one bead per well the beads in the wells comprise our individual arrays because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called “decoding” in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we employ several proprietary methods for decoding which is a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a functional validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each bead type multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads 

 

an experiment is performed by preparing a sample such as dna and introducing it to the array the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated beads the molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with fluorescent dye either before or after the binding which can be detected by shining a laser on the beadchip this allows the detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

 

veracode technology 

 

our proprietary veracode technology platform leverages the power of digital holographic codes to provide a robust detection method for multiplex assays requiring high precision accuracy and speed veracode enables lowcost multiplexing from 1 to 384plex in a single well at the heart of the veracode technology are cylindrical glass beads measuring 240 microns in length by 28 microns in diameter each veracode bead type is inscribed with a unique digital holographic code to designate and track the specific analyte or genotype of interest throughout the multiplex reaction when excited by a laser each veracode bead emits a unique code image allowing for quick and specific detection by illumina’s beadxpress reader system depending on desired multiplex levels assays are created by pooling microbeads with code diversities from one to several hundred unlike traditional microarrays the veracode microbeads are used in solution which takes advantage of solutionphase kinetics for more rapid hybridization times dramatically reducing the time to achieve results this technology enables us to serve a number of markets including research agriculture forensics pharmaceuticals and molecular diagnostics

intellectual property 

 

we have an extensive intellectual property portfolio including as of february 1 2010 ownership of or exclusive licenses to 159 issued us patents and 171 pending us patent applications including eight allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents our issued patents include those directed to various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments and chemical detection technologies and have terms that expire between 2010 and 2027 we continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies we have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries 

 

we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our trade secrets to enforce our patents copyrights and trademarks to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products 

 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment we have exclusive licenses from tufts university to patents that are directed to our beadarray technology these patents were filed by dr david walt who is a member of our board of directors the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2010 and 2020 we have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect 

 

research and development 

 

we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize our sequencing beadarray veracode and oligo synthesis technologies and to support commercialization of the products and services derived from these technologies 

 

our research and development expenses for 2009 2008 and 2007 were 1406 million 1000 million and 739 million respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2010 as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts 

 

marketing and distribution 

 

our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments may be 

involved in many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and agricultural research our potential customers include pharmaceutical biotechnology agrichemical diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic or private research centers the genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will ultimately be driven by among other items 

 

  

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe and the asiapacific region in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in addition in certain markets within europe the asiapacific region the middle east and south africa we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products we expect to continue to increase our sales and distribution resources during 2010 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products 

 

manufacturing 

 

we manufacture sequencing and array instrument platforms reagent kits scanning equipment and oligos our manufacturing capacity for consumables and instruments has grown during 2009 to support our increased customer demand we are also focused on continuing to enhance the quality and manufacturing yield of our beadchips and flow cells to continue to increase throughput and improve the quality and manufacturing yield as we increase the complexity of our products we are exploring ways to continue increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances 

 

raw materials 

 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies we have multiple commercial sources for many of our components and supplies however there are some raw materials we obtain from single source suppliers to mitigate potential risks arising from single source suppliers we believe that we can redesign our products for alternative components or use alternative reagents in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain 

 

competition 

 

although we expect that our products and services will provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the sequencing snp genotyping gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets these include companies such as affymetrix inc agilent technologies inc beckman coulter inc complete genomics inc general electric company helicos biosciences corporation life technologies corporation luminex corporation pacific biosciences inc roche diagnostics corp sequenom inc and qiagen nv some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in 

order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over competing products 

 

segment and geographic information 

 

during the first quarter of 2008 we reorganized our operating structure into two newly created business segments life sciences and diagnostics our life sciences business unit includes all products and services that are primarily related to the research market namely the product lines based on our sequencing beadarray and veracode technologies and our diagnostics business unit focuses on the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics during 2009 we had limited activity related to the diagnostics business unit and operating results were reported on an aggregate basis to our chief operating decision maker the chief executive officer accordingly we operated in one reportable segment during 2009 

 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america europe and the asiapacific region shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 3191 million or 48 of our total revenue during 2009 compared to 2932 million or 51 and 1591 million or 43 in 2008 and 2007 respectively sales to customers outside of the united states were generally denominated in us dollars in 2008 we reorganized our international structure to establish more efficient channels among product development product manufacturing and sales the reorganization increased our foreign subsidiaries’ anticipated dependence on the us entity for management decisions financial support production assets and inventory thereby making the foreign subsidiaries more of a direct and integral component of the us entity’s operations as a result we reassessed the primary economic environment of our foreign subsidiaries and determined the subsidiaries are more us dollar based resulting in a us dollar functional currency determination we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog was 2276 million and 1130 million at january 3 2010 and december 28 2008 respectively generally our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date however we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products the timing of shipments depends on several factors including agreed upon shipping schedules which may span multiple quarters and whether the product is catalog or custom we reasonably expect an estimated 90 of the backlog as of january 3 2010 to be shipped within the fiscal year ending january 2 2011 although we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title to a customer we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue even after shipment depending on the specific arrangement with a customer and the applicable accounting treatment a material portion of our backlog at january 3 2010 is associated with a large order we received from one customer for which we anticipate using operating lease accounting that will require us to recognize revenue over a period of three years with the majority of that revenue recognized in 2011 and 2012 

 

seasonality 

 

historically customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation although demand for our products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as a result in part of us academic customers spending unused budget allocations before the end of the us government’s fiscal year 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance in all material respects with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination 

of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

 

government regulation 

 

our products are not currently subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease such as molecular diagnostic products regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will be a significant factor in the development testing production and marketing of such products products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets depending on their intended use will be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance following a premarket notification process also known as a 510k clearance or premarket approval pma from the fda prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay 

 

the shorter 510k clearance process which generally takes from three to six months after submission but can take significantly longer may be utilized if it is demonstrated that the new product is “substantially equivalent” to a similar product that has already been cleared by the fda the longer pma process is much more costly uncertain and generally takes from nine months to two years after filing because we cannot assure you that any molecular diagnostic products that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process or will ultimately be approved at all the regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed and may be significantly more expensive than anticipated if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

 

changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

 

in addition the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture market and sell our existing and future products that are intended for and marketed and labeled as “research use only” or ruo is uncertain if such products are used or could be used even without our consent for the diagnosis of disease if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

employees 

 

as of january 3 2010 we had a total of 1781 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

 

we face intense competition which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 

 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a widerange of competing technologies we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or 

improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could also develop competing products we believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product therefore it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors to the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products our competitive position may suffer 

 

the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive with several large companies already having significant market share intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets including clinical and reference laboratories which could deter acceptance of our products in addition some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 

 

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences agricultural and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function namely sequencing genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and biological function for instance demand for our microarray products may be adversely affected if researchers fail to find meaningful correlations between genetic variation such as snps and disease susceptibility through genome wide association studies in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to sustain profitability 

 

if the quality of our products does not meet our customers’ expectations then our sales and operating earnings and ultimately our reputation could be negatively impacted 

 

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products because our instruments and reagents are highly complex the occurrence of defects may increase as we continue to introduce new products and services although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities in addition identifying the root cause of quality issues particularly those affecting reagents may be difficult which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with for example shipment holds product recalls and warranty or other service obligations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer which could adversely affect our business as well as our financial results 

if we do not successfully manage the development and launch of new products or services including product transitions our financial results could be adversely affected 

 

we face risks associated with launching new products and preannouncing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested if our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date in addition we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions or transition requirements or programs such as tradein programs with respect to newly launched products or products in development relative to our existing products which could adversely affect sales of our existing products the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

we continue to increase our capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our business plan for 2010 there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products also we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand especially as we introduce new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

 

additionally we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and hayward california singapore and little chesterford united kingdom these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or floods if a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products 

 

also many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

 

our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies 

 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products services and technologies we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of technologies products or businesses acquisitions involve 

numerous risks and operational financial and managerial challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

  

in addition the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas including sales and marketing research and development manufacturing finance legal and information technologies we cannot assure you that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame or at all 

 

the timing and extent of funding provided by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the recovery act could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

the recovery act was enacted in february 2009 to provide stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the economic downturn as part of the recovery act legislation over 10 billion in funding was provided to the national institute of health through september 2010 to support the advancement of scientific research a portion of the stimulus funding may support the analysis of genetic variation and biological function and have a significant positive impact on our business in the shortterm however our customers may delay or reduce their purchases of our products as they wait to learn whether and to what extent they will receive stimulus funding if our customers are unable to obtain stimulus money they may reduce their research and development budgets resulting in a decrease in demand for our products in addition it is unclear what will happen to demand for our products after the stimulus funds from the recovery act have been allocated and spent a decline in demand will reduce our revenues which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets the recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets a severe or prolonged economic downturn such as the recent global financial 

crisis could result in a variety of risks to our business including in particular reductions or delays in planned improvements to healthcare systems research and development funding and purchases of our products and services or costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the liquidity of our investment portfolio could be impaired such as when more than 50 million of auction rate securities that we held for investment became illiquid in february 2008 because their scheduled auctions failed furthermore as is the case for almost any other business we face the following risks from a severe or prolonged economic downturn 

 

  

in addition certain of our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us if that were to occur our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding could increase additionally these economic conditions may cause our smaller suppliers to be unable to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized components which would impair our ability to manufacture on schedule and at commercially reasonable costs suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 

 

our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new products 

 

our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changes in customer needs existing and emerging competition strong price competition and frequent new product introductions accordingly our continued growth depends on continuously developing and commercializing new products and services including improving our existing products and services in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies our products and services will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors we believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made 

 

to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development we may lose market share to our competitors which will be difficult or impossible to regain an inability for technological or other reasons to successfully develop and introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business in the past we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future delays in the development and introduction of new products we cannot assure you that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace achieve market acceptance or compete successfully with competing technologies some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include 

 

 19 

 

  

we depend on thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers for components and materials used in our products and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are delayed or interrupted or if the quality of the components or materials supplied do not meet our requirements we may not be able to launch manufacture or ship our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

the nature of our products requires customized components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources and in the case of some components and materials from only a single source if deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply we may not be able to obtain these components or materials timely or in sufficient quantities or qualities or at all in order to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs in addition the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the components or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue which would adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

an inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our operations could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our business has grown rapidly with total revenues increasing from 735 million for the year ended january 1 2006 to 6663 million for the year ended january 3 2010 and with the number of employees increasing from 375 to 1781 during the same period we expect to continue to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans the rapid expansion of our business and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our management and operational systems our ability to effectively manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a global basis if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement and improve our research product development manufacturing sales and marketing and customer support programs enhance our operational and financial control systems expand train and manage our employee base integrate acquired businesses and effectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

 

we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our 

products or technologies additionally integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive causing key employees of the acquired business to leave further we use stock options and restricted stock to provide incentives for our key personnel to remain with us and to align their interests with those of the company by building longterm stockholder value if our stock price decreases the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay 

 

doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our business 

 

conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources if we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively including the risks noted below our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe and the asiapacific region as well as manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom and singapore during 2009 the majority of our sales to international customers and purchases of raw materials from international suppliers were denominated in us dollars shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 48 51 and 43 of our total revenue for the years ended january 3 2010 december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 respectively we intend to continue to expand our international presence by selling to customers located outside of the united states and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow 

 

international sales entail a variety of risks including 

 

  

changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations the recent global financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax laws or tax rates 

changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions or the result of examinations by various tax authorities 

 

in addition we could lose some or all of the tax deduction for interest expense associated with our 400 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2014 if these notes are not subject to the special treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments the notes are converted or we invest in nontaxable investments 

 

any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position 

 

our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the united states these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the united states 

 

the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences agricultural and pharmaceutical industries including our patent position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets in addition patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until patents issue and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued questions as to inventorship or ownership may also arise any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all furthermore as issued patents expire we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products and as a result we may lose revenue 

 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products there is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies also our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 

 

we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary knowhow protection for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other confidential information among other things we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants there can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements that we have with our employees collaborators and consultants will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and confidential information or will provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information accordingly there also can be no assurance that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

litigation other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services 

 

our success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize or sell products and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful infringement claim against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability 

 

our products if used for the diagnosis of disease could be subject to government regulation and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome 

 

our products are not currently subject to fda clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease however as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease certain of our products are likely to become subject to regulation by the fda or comparable agencies of other countries including requirements for regulatory approval of such products before they can be marketed such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results in addition changes to the current regulatory framework including the imposition of additional or new regulations could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain fda or comparable regulatory approval of our products if required 

 

molecular diagnostic products in particular depending on their intended use may be regulated as medical devices by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries and may require either receiving clearance from the fda following a premarket notification process or premarket approval from the fda in each case prior to marketing obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay if we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner or at all 

 

in addition the regulatory approval or clearance process required to manufacture market and sell our existing and future products that are intended for and marketed and labeled as “research use only” or ruo is uncertain if such products are used or could be used even without our consent for the diagnosis of disease if the fda or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our ruo products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we may not be able to sustain operating profitability 

 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services the effects of new product launches and related promotions the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform the timing of our customers’ funding changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue while we anticipate future growth there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis this is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear with a concentration of orders in the final week of the quarter in light of that our revenue cutoff and recognition procedures together with our manufacturing and shipping operations may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter 

 

a large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products accordingly our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses and if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue in addition noncash stockbased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses particularly from quarter to quarter we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

 

from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment and fair value determinations inventories business combinations and intangible asset valuations and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition in addition the timing of large orders can have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter 

 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products or services 

 

genetic testing has raised ethical legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information governmental authorities could for social or other purposes call for limits on or 

regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

certain statements set forth below constitute forwardlooking statements see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for additional factors relating to such statements and see “risk factors” in 

item 1a of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

business overview 

 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological function using our proprietary technologies we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing genotyping and gene expression markets and we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics our customers include leading genomic research centers pharmaceutical companies academic institutions clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies 

 

we develop and commercialize sequencing technologies used to perform a range of analyses including de novo sequencing whole genome resequencing gene expression analysis and small rna analysis our product and service offerings also include leadingedge solutions for singlenucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping copy number variation cnv dna methylation studies gene expression profiling and lowmultiplex analysis of dna rna and protein we believe we are the only company with genomescale technology for sequencing genotyping and gene expression — the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 

 

our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to determine and analyze the billions of bits of genetic information needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 

 

during the first quarter of 2008 we reorganized our operating structure into a newly created life sciences business unit which includes all products and services that are primarily related to the research market namely those based on our sequencing beadarray and veracode technologies we also created a diagnostics business unit to focus on the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics for the year ended january 3 2010 we had limited activity related to the diagnostics business unit and operating results were reported on an aggregate basis to the chief operating decision maker the chief executive officer accordingly we operated in one segment for the year ended january 3 2010 we will begin reporting in two segments once revenues operating profit or loss or assets of the diagnostics business unit exceed 10 of the consolidated amounts 

 

our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be useful for understanding the relevant trends going forward however this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item 15 of this report 

 

business trends and outlook 

 

our financial results have been and will continue to be impacted by several significant trends which are described below 

 

next generation sequencing 

 

strong demand for next generation sequencing applications continues to drive both sequencing instrument and consumable sales in 2009 we made advances to our sequencing technology including enhanced chemistry algorithms and hardware which substantially improved accuracy read length data density and ease of use the combination of these advances increased the output and decreased the cost of sequencing and expanded the number of applications that researchers can perform on our sequencing systems in early 2010 we expect to begin customer shipments of our recently announced hiseq 2000 next generation sequencing instrument which we believe will allow customers to sequence whole human genomes for less than 10000 in reagent costs we anticipate our revenue for 2010 will have higher growth in the second half of the year 

compared to the first half due to the timing of the manufacturing scaleup of the hiseq 2000 and other significant product launches scheduled for later in the year we believe that as the cost of next generation sequencing continues to decline the number of samples available for sequencing will significantly increase 

 

genome wide association studies gwas 

 

we experienced a slowdown in the sales of our microarray products during 2009 that was largely attributable to researchers reducing or suspending the initiation of new studies as they waited for rare variant content emerging from the 1000 genomes project an international research effort launched in 2008 to establish the most detailed catalog of human genetic variation despite advances in sequencing technology we believe microarrays remain a cheaper faster and materially more accurate technology for use when genetic content is known the information content of specific microarrays is fixed and reproducible as such specific microarrays provide repeatable standardized assays for certain subsets of bases within the overall genome during 2010 as part of our previously announced gwas roadmap we plan to launch arrays that will feature millions of more markers per beadchip and new rare variant content from the 1000 genomes project as these arrays become available we believe activity in the microarray market will increase relative to 2009 

 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the recovery act 

 

the recovery act was enacted in february 2009 to provide stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the economic downturn as part of the recovery act legislation over 10 billion in funding was provided to the national institute of health nih through september 2010 to support the advancement of scientific research in the second and third quarters of 2009 we experienced negative unintended consequences of the recovery act as customers delayed orders while they waited to receive stimulus funds during the fourth quarter of 2009 we believe we saw an increase in the distribution of recovery act funds and received an estimated 16 million in orders directly related to recovery act grants we believe a significant portion of recovery act awards may be distributed in 2010 which may create a pipeline of opportunity in the upcoming year 

 

life science research funding across regional markets 

 

we have developed a broad sales and distribution network with a sales presence in more than 40 countries our financial results will continue to be impacted by significant regional trends in life science research funding as described below 

 

  

cost of revenue 

 

our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue declined during 2009 due to cost efficiencies in our manufacturing process and an improved mix of sequencing consumables driven by growth in the installed base of our sequencing systems we expect changes in our product mix to continue to affect our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue particularly in the latter half of the year we anticipate cost of revenue as a 

percentage of revenue to be lower in the first half of the year and then increase as the mix shifts to newer products and the effects of our tradein promotions associated with the launch of the hiseq 2000 are realized additionally we expect price competition to continue in our market causing added variability in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue on a quarterly and annual basis 

 

operating expense 

 

we expect to incur additional operating costs to support the expected growth in our business as a result of revenues growing faster in the second half of 2010 we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to be higher in the first half of the year compared with the second half we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets accordingly we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base selling general and administrative expenses are also expected to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our staff and add sales and marketing infrastructure 

 

while these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results the other transactions events and trends discussed in “risk factors” in item 1a of this report may also materially impact our business operations and financial results 

results of operations 

 

to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended january 3 2010 december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 stated as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

 

comparison of years ended january 3 2010 and december 28 2008 

 

our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the year ended january 3 2010 was 53 weeks and the year end december 28 2008 was 52 weeks 

revenue 

 

 

 

product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments 

 

consumable revenue increased 576 million or 17 to 3913 million for the year ended january 3 2010 compared to 3337 million for the year ended december 28 2008 microarray consumable revenue which constituted more than half of our consumable revenue declined 114 million or 4 primarily attributable to lower sales of wholegenome genotyping arrays partially offset by growth in focused content arrays the decline was driven by customers delaying the start of new gwas in anticipation of new and rare variant content from the 1000 genome project order delays directly related to stimulus funding under the recovery act and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers sales volume for our infinium beadchip product lines which constitute a majority of our microarray consumable sales was relatively flat on a sample basis during 2009 compared to 2008 the average selling price per sample however declined due to a change in product mix attributable to growth in the sales of our focused content arrays coupled with lower sales of wholegenome genotyping arrays and an increase in the average number of samples per beadchip 

 

revenue from sequencing consumables increased 689 million or 144 driven by growth in the installed base of our genome analyzer systems and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale the increase was partially offset by a loss of sales related to a quality issue affecting our pairedend cluster kits that arose in september 2009 when some of our larger sequencing customers began experiencing higher than average error rates on the second read of their pairedend analysis during the fourth quarter we began shipping reformulated pairedend cluster kits at full capacity and cleared the related shipping backlog 

 

revenue from the sale of instruments increased 400 million or 22 to 2257 million for the year ended january 3 2010 compared to 1857 million for the year ended december 28 2008 primarily due to a 564 million or 43 increase in sales of our sequencing systems during 2009 as compared to 2008 both units sold and average selling prices increased for our genome analyzer systems which constitute a majority of sequencing instrument revenue the increase in units sold was driven by increased demand for next generation sequencing and our sequencingbysynthesis technology the increase in average selling prices was attributable to the product transition from the genome analyzer i to the genome analyzer ii in the second quarter of 2008 and technological improvements leading to the launch of the genome analyzer iix in the second quarter of 2009 the increase in sequencing instrument revenue was partially offset by a 164 million or 30 decrease in the sales of our microarray systems which declined primarily due to customers delaying the start of new gwas in anticipation of new and rare variant content from the 1000 genomes project order delays directly related to stimulus funding under the recovery act and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue 

 

 

total cost of revenue which excludes the impairment of manufacturing equipment and the amortization of intangible assets remained flat despite higher sales primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing costs and improved efficiencies 

 

cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was 30 for the year ended january 3 2010 compared to 36 for the year ended december 28 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower costs for our sequencing consumables and instrumentation the cost of sequencing consumables decreased as a percentage of related revenue due to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes and the benefit of decreased costs associated with the reformulation of our sequencing kits launched at the end of the third quarter of 2008 the cost of sequencing instruments decreased as a percentage of related revenue due to production efficiencies and reduced material costs coupled with higher average selling prices 

 

operating expenses 

 

 

 

the increase in research and development was driven primarily by a 229 million increase in personnelrelated expenses including salaries noncash stockbased compensation and benefits a 104 million increase to nonpersonnel related expenses and an increase in outside services of 32 million attributable to consulting fees these increases are primarily related to the growth in our efforts to optimize and commercialize our sequencing and beadarray technologies 

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was driven by an increase of 266 million in personnelrelated expenses associated with the growth of our business including salaries noncash stockbased compensation and benefits 

 

acquired inprocess research and development iprd 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 28 2008 we recorded acquired iprd charges of 247 million as a result of the avantome inc acquisition in august 2008 during the year ended january 3 2010 we recorded additional iprd charges of 113 million related to milestone payments made to avantome inc’s former shareholders 

 

other income expense net 

 

 

interest income decreased despite an increase in our average cash and investment balance due to an overall decline in interest rates during 2009 interest expense increased due to the amortization of the discount on our convertible senior notes other income net decreased due to a decrease of 15 million in gains on net foreign currency transactions which was partially offset by a gain of 08 million on the conversion of a portion of our debt during the first quarter of 2009 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

the increase in the provision for income taxes was attributable to the increase in the consolidated income before income taxes the effective tax rate decreased from 458 in 2008 to 367 in 2009 predominately because the amount of nondeductible acquired iprd recognized for financial reporting purposes was lower by 133 million additionally the percentage of consolidated income before income taxes earned in foreign jurisdictions which primarily have lower statutory tax rates than the us statutory tax rate increased from 36 in 2008 to 43 in 2009 

 

comparison of years ended december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 

 

our fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the years ended december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 were both 52 weeks 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments 

 

revenue from the sale of consumables increased 1402 million or 72 to 3337 million for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to 1935 million for the year ended december 30 2007 growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our infinium and sequencing products which led to increased sales of 1048 million and 354 million respectively the increase in revenue associated with our infinium products was attributable to the strong demand for our infinium highdensity beadchips particularly the human610quad which we began shipping during the first quarter of 2008 of the overall increase in infinium beadchip sales approximately 79 was due to new product introductions with higher average selling prices while the remaining 21 can be attributed to increased volume the increase in sequencing consumables was primarily attributable to the growth of our installed base of instruments and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale 

 

revenue from the sale of instruments increased 648 million or 54 to 1857 million for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to 1209 million for the year ended december 30 2007 the increase was primarily attributable to a 630 million increase in sales of our genome analyzer driven by both an increase in sales volume and average selling prices additionally during the second quarter of 2008 we launched the iscan system our nextgeneration beadchip scanner to replace the beadarray reader any increase in revenue resulting from shipments of this new system was offset by a reduction in sales of our beadarray reader as we stopped manufacturing this product upon the launch of our iscan system 

cost of product and service and other revenue 

 

 

 

total cost of revenue which excludes the impairment of manufacturing equipment and the amortization of intangible assets increased primarily due to higher instrument and consumable sales 

 

cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was 36 for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to 37 for the year ended december 30 2007 the decrease was primarily due to favorable product mix driven by increased sales of our new highdensity infinium beadchips with higher average selling prices as compared to the infinium beadchips sold in the prior year this was partially offset by increased provisions for inventory obsolescence of 72 million for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to 19 million for the year ended december 30 2007 the increase in the inventory reserve was primarily associated with product transitions during the year we recorded reserves for product obsolescence associated with the launch of our new infinium beadchips and the launch of a new sequencing kit instrument cost of sales as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly over the prior year due to lower average selling prices mainly associated with promotional campaigns as we launched our next generation beadarray reader the iscan in the first half of 2008 

 

operating expenses 

 

 

 

the increase in research and development was driven by a 174 million increase in personnelrelated expenses associated with increased headcount including salaries noncash stockbased compensation and benefits an 116 million increase to nonpersonnel related expenses associated with the growth of our business and a 15 million increase to accrued compensation expense associated with contingent consideration for the avantome acquisition completed on august 1 2008 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in outside services of 45 million primarily related to a decrease in consulting fees 

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by an increase of 428 million in personnelrelated expenses including salaries noncash stockbased compensation and benefits and a 40 million increase to nonpersonnel related expenses these increases were primarily associated with the growth of our business 

 

acquired inprocess research and development iprd 

 

 

as a result of the avantome inc acquisition in august 2008 and the solexa inc acquisition in january 2007 we recorded acquired iprd charges of 247 million and 3034 million respectively 

 

litigation settlements 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 30 2007 we recorded a charge of 545 million associated with two settlement agreements the total charge is comprised primarily of 540 million related to a 900 million settlement with affymetrix entered into on january 9 2008 for certain patent litigation between the parties see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the affymetrix settlement 

 

other income expense net 

 

 

 

interest income decreased due to a change in our cash and investment portfolio to a mix of shorter duration maturities and an increased number of agencyrated investments coupled with the overall decline in interest rates due to market conditions interest expense increased due to the amortization of the discount on our convertible senior notes and an additional month and a half of interest expense recorded in the year ended december 28 2008 compared to the year ended december 30 2007 other income expense net increased primarily due to 19 million in net foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to immaterial losses recorded in the year ended december 30 2007 

 

provision benefit for income taxes 

 

 

 

the provision benefit for income taxes in 2008 was different than in 2007 primarily because the amount of nondeductible acquired iprd recognized for financial reporting purposes was lower by 2787 million in addition for the year ended december 30 2007 the provision for income taxes was reduced by 171 million as a result of the release of the valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flow summary 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january 3 2010 consists of net income of 723 million plus net noncash adjustments of 1135 million and an 113 million increase in net operating assets the primary noncash expenses added back to net income included share based compensation of 608 million and depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment intangibles and the debt discount on our convertible notes totaling 515 million the main drivers in the change in net operating assets included increases in accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and accrued liabilities these increases were primarily related to the growth of our business 

 

investing activities 

 

cash used in investing activities totaled 2557 million for the year ended january 3 2010 we purchased and sold availableforsale securities totaling 6945 million and 5152 million respectively we incurred 518 million in capital expenditures primarily associated with the expansion of our facilities and infrastructure at our san diego hayward and uk locations additionally in january 2009 we executed a strategic alliance with oxford nanopore technologies which consisted of a commercialization agreement and an 180 million equity investment we also agreed to make an additional equity investment upon the achievement of a specific technical milestone 

 

in august 2008 we completed our acquisition of avantome inc as consideration for the acquisition we paid 258 million in cash including transaction costs at the closing of the acquisition and have subsequently paid 150 million as of february 1 2010 based on the achievement of or amendments relating to certain milestones we may pay up to an additional 200 million in contingent cash consideration to avantome’s former shareholders based on the achievement of certain remaining milestones 

 

in january 2008 as part of our affymetrix settlement we recorded a 360 million intangible asset for licensed technology obtained in the settlement see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding intangible assets 

 

in january of 2007 we completed our acquisition of solexa inc in a stockforstock merger transaction the company issued approximately 262 million shares of its common stock as consideration for this merger the acquisition resulted in net cash acquired of 721 million 

 

financing activities 

 

cash used in financing activities totaled 989 million for the year ended january 3 2010 during the year we repurchased approximately 61 million shares of our common stock for 1751 million which was partially offset by 394 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and 393 million of incremental tax benefits related to stock options exercised 

in august 2008 we issued a total of 81 million shares at a public offering price of 4375 per share raising net proceeds to the company of 3427 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses during the year ended december 28 2008 we also repurchased approximately 31 million shares of our common stock for 708 million 

 

in february 2007 we issued 4000 million principal amount of 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 the net proceeds from the offering after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses were approximately 3903 million we used 2016 million of the net proceeds to purchase approximately 116 million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering we used 466 million of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the net cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which are designed to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our convertible senior notes 

 

liquidity 

 

we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of our liquidity our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating investing and financing needs historically we have issued debt and equity securities to finance our requirements to the extent that cash provided by operating activities was not sufficient to fund our needs we may require additional funding in the future and our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

at january 3 2010 we had approximately 6935 million in cash and shortterm investments shortterm investments include marketable securities and auction rate securities totaling 4940 million and 549 million respectively our marketable securities consist of debt securities in government sponsored entities corporate debt securities and us treasury notes we do not hold securities backed by mortgages our auction rate securities were issued primarily by municipalities and universities the markets for auction rate securities effectively ceased when the vast majority of auctions failed in february 2008 preventing investors from selling their auction rate securities as of january 3 2010 the securities continued to fail auction and remained illiquid in november 2008 we signed a settlement agreement allowing us to sell our auction rate securities at par value to ubs ag ubs at our discretion during the period of june 30 2010 through july 2 2012 because we intend to exercise this right when it becomes available we have classified our auction rate securities as shortterm on the balance sheet see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our auction rate securities 

 

our outstanding convertible senior notes were convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock for the period from april 1 2008 through december 31 2008 and became convertible again beginning april 1 2009 through december 31 2009 on december 29 2008 a noteholder converted notes in an aggregate principal amount of 100 million on february 4 2009 the settlement date we paid the noteholder the conversion value of the notes in cash up to the principal amount of the notes the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount totaling 29 million was paid in shares of common stock this equity dilution upon conversion of the notes was offset by the reacquisition of the shares under the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the offering of the notes see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes 

 

our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include expenditures related to 

 

 39 

 

  

we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

 

we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs in 2010 barring unforeseen circumstances operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures at the present time we have no material commitments for capital expenditures our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including 

 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes during the fiscal year ended january 3 2010 we were not involved in any “off balance sheet arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the securities and exchange commission 

 

contractual obligations 

 

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding the following table represents our contractual obligations as of january 3 2010 aggregated by type amounts in thousands

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected in addition if our assumptions change we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments in addition had we used estimates different from any of these our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and our disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of our board of directors our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue primarily consists of sales of arrays reagents flow cells and instrumentation service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services extended warranty sales and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgments and estimates and actual results may differ from our estimates 

 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met all revenue is recorded net of any discounts 

 

revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer or agreedto milestones are reached 

 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable we ensure there are no refund rights if payment terms are based on future performance we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 

sales of instrumentation generally include a standard oneyear warranty we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts which are generally for one year starting upon the expiration of the initial warranty revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing its products under warranty were greater than its estimates gross margins could be adversely affected 

 

we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products andor services these products andor services are generally delivered within a short time frame approximately three to six months of the contract execution date revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a standalone basis 

 

for transactions entered into in 2009 consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor thirdparty evidence exists we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable see recent accounting pronouncements in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to our change in authoritative accounting guidance for revenue recognition 

 

for transactions entered into prior to 2009 consideration was generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon its relative fair value when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for all units of accounting in an arrangement the fair value of an item was generally the price charged for the product if the item was regularly sold on a standalone basis in those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for the undelivered items but not for the delivered items the residual method was used to allocate the arrangement consideration under the residual method the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items when we were unable to establish standalone value for delivered items or when fair value of undelivered items had not been established revenue was deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been performed or until fair value could objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 

 

in order to establish vsoe of selling price we must regularly sell the product andor service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range if there is not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry we have rarely established selling price using thirdparty evidence if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists we determine its best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12 month period as well as market conditions if the product or service has no history of sales we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts 

 

we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

 

investments 

 

we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use 

of unobservable inputs we use a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable to measure fair value 

 

  

in using this fair value hierarchy management may be required to make assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value these assumptions are judgmental in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycle and development plans product expiration and quality issues historical experience and our current inventory levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

 

contingencies 

 

we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters we routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses to the extent losses are reasonably estimable if losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is probable and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters management considers many factors these factors include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes which may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 

 

business combinations and intangible asset valuation 

 

under the purchase method of accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed these 

valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

 

the company’s intangible assets are comprised primarily of licensed technology from the affymetrix settlement entered into on january 9 2008 and acquired core technology and customer relationships from the solexa acquisition management uses a discounted cash flow method to value our intangible assets this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

 

goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

 

we estimate the fair value of intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows we test for potential impairment of goodwill annually in our second fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise 

 

in order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we had a total of 2134 million in goodwill 1172 million in net property and equipment and 438 million in net intangible assets on our balance sheet at january 3 2010 

 

in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses 

 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

convertible senior notes 

 

during the first quarter of 2009 we adopted new authoritative guidance that significantly impacts the accounting for our convertible senior notes by requiring us to account separately for the liability and equity components of the notes the liability component is measured so the effective interest expense associated with the notes reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature the difference between the cash proceeds associated with the notes and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes 

 

determining the fair value of the liability component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the liability component and in effect the associated interest expense according to the guidance the carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component if no similar liabilities exist estimates of fair value are primarily determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability component including market interest rates credit standing yield curves and volatilities 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

 

the determination of fair value of stockbased awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price expected option life expected dividends and the riskfree interest rate we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchangetraded call options on our common stock the expected option life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees we determined expected dividend yield to be 0 given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends the riskfree interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the sharebased awards if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 

 

income taxes 

 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the us and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of the company’s future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

 

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled 

reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliable forecasting projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies based on the available evidence as of january 3 2010 we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we recorded a valuation allowance of 28 million and 121 million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets respectively 

 

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company’s return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate sensitivity 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments for example if a 100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2010 our interest income would change by approximately 69 million in relation to amounts we would expect to earn based on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of january 3 2010 

 

market price sensitive instruments 

 

in order to reduce potential equity dilution in connection with the issuance and potential conversion of our convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions entitling us to purchase up to 18322320 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 2183 per share subject to adjustment in addition we sold to the hedge transaction counterparties warrants exercisable on a netshare basis for up to 18322320 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 31435 per share subject to adjustment the antidilutive effect of the note hedge transactions if any could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants which occur during 2014 assuming the warrants are exercised 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity’s us dollar functional currency these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro yen british pound sterling australian dollar and singapore dollar both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income loss we recognized a 

net currency exchange gain on business transactions net of hedging transactions of 04 million and 19 million for the years ended january 3 2010 and december 28 2008 respectively which are included in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations 

 

during 2009 we began using forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one month or less realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income loss as they have not been designated for hedge accounting these contracts which settle monthly effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities at january 3 2010 we had an immaterial amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge foreign currency risk

we have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the securities exchange act as of january 3 2010 based upon that evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of january 3 2010 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that a the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and b such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures our management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level because of inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues if any within a company have been detected 

 

an evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2009 and that has materially affected or is 

reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting the evaluation did not identify any such change 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

 

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control — integrated framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 3 2010 the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 3 2010 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein

the board of directors and stockholders of 

illumina inc 

 

we have audited illumina inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of january 3 2010 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria illumina inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion illumina inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 3 2010 based on the coso criteria 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of illumina inc as of january 3 2010 and december 28 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended january 3 2010 of illumina inc and our report dated february 26 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

overview 

 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function we were incorporated in california in april 1998 and reincorporated in delaware in july 2000 our principal executive offices are located at 9885 towne centre drive san diego california 92121 our telephone number is 858 2024500 

 

using our proprietary technologies we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing genotyping and gene expression markets in the future we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics our customers include leading genomic research centers pharmaceutical companies academic institutions clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 

 

on january 26 2007 we completed the acquisition of solexa inc solexa for 262 million shares of our common stock as a result of that acquisition we develop and commercialize sequencing technologies used to 

perform a range of analyses including whole genome resequencing gene expression analysis and small rna analysis we believe we are the only company with genomescale technology for sequencing genotyping and gene expression the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 

 

during the first quarter of 2008 we reorganized our operating structure into two newly created business segments life sciences and diagnostics during 2008 the diagnostics business unit had limited business activity and accordingly operating results were reported on an aggregate basis as one operating segment in the future at each reporting period end we will reassess our reportable operating segments particularly as we enter the market for molecular diagnostics 

 

on august 1 2008 we completed the acquisition of avantome inc avantome as consideration for the acquisition we paid 258 million in cash and may pay up to an additional 350 million in contingent cash consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones avantome is a development stage company working on developing lowcost long read sequencing technology we expect this technology if and when available as a product to have applicability to both the research and diagnostic markets 

 

our strategy 

 

our goal is to make our genome analyzer beadarray and beadxpress platforms the industry standards for products and services addressing the genetic analysis markets we plan to achieve this by 

 

  

our markets 

 

our current technologies serve three primary markets nextgeneration sequencing midtohighcomplexity microarrays for genotyping and gene expression and the “applied markets” the majority of which are comprised of agricultural research nextgeneration sequencing is the most rapidly growing of these three markets it is fueled by private and public funding new global initiatives to broadly characterize genetic variation and the migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencing based technologies we believe our dna sequencing systems coupled with complementary technologies from strategic investments including the acquisition of avantome and our collaborative alliance with oxford nanopore technologies will enable us to address numerous market segments with innovative solutions 

 

in 2009 we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics the molecular diagnostic market is currently estimated at nearly 3 billion with the potential to grow to over 5 billion by 2012 this market assessment covers regulated assays and reagents and does not factor in laboratorydeveloped tests which account for a significant portion of the total market the primary growth drivers in the molecular diagnostics market are the continued discovery of genetic markers with proven clinical utility the increasing adoption of genetic based diagnostic tests and the expansion of reimbursement programs to include a greater number of approved diagnostic tests we believe our veracode technology platform is ideally suited to provide a costeffective highthroughput mid to lowmultiplex solution to the molecular diagnostic market we are planning to submit the platform for review by the food and drug administration in 2009 

 

industry background 

 

genetic variation and biological function 

 

every person inherits two copies of each gene one from each parent the two copies of each gene may be identical or they may be different these differences are referred to as genetic variation examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color genetic variation can also have important medical consequences genetic variation affects disease susceptibility including predisposition 

to cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease in addition genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug treatment some people may respond well others may not respond at all and still others may experience adverse side effects a common form of genetic variation is a singlenucleotide polymorphism or snp a snp is a variation in a single position in a dna sequence it is estimated that the human genome contains over ten million snps 

 

while in some cases a single snp will be responsible for medically important effects it is now believed that combinations of snps may contribute to the development of most common diseases since there are millions of snps it is important to investigate many representative wellchosen snps simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable information 

 

another contributor to disease and dysfunction is the over or underexpression of genes within an organism’s cells a very complex network of genes interacts to maintain health in complex organisms the challenge for scientists is to delineate the associated genes’ expression patterns and their relationship to disease until recently this problem was addressed by investigating effects on a genebygene basis this is time consuming and difficulties exist when several pathways cannot be observed or “controlled” at the same time with the advent of microarray technology thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time 

 

there are multiple methods of studying genetic variation and biological function including sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling each of which is uniquely addressed in our breadth of products and services our broad portfolio of current products and services supports a range of applications from highest multiplexing for wholegenome discovery and profiling to midand lowmultiplexing options for highthroughput targeted screening 

 

sequencing 

 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of bases a c g or t in a dna sample which can be further divided into de novo sequencing resequencing and tag sequencing in de novo sequencing the goal is to determine the sequence of a representative sample from a species never before sequenced understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between many species can help our understanding of the function of the protein structures encoded in the dna 

 

in resequencing the sequence of samples from a given species is determined and compared to a standard or reference sequence to identify changes that reflect genetic variation resequencing studies can be performed on a genomewide basis which is referred to as wholegenome resequencing or on targeted areas of the genome for example regions identified by genomewide association study which is known as targeted resequencing this is an extremely comprehensive form of genetic analysis in which every base is characterized for possible mutations we believe that these underlying discoveries will likely feed the development of new array products for broader testing and biomarker validation 

 

in tag sequencing short sequences often representative of a larger molecule or genomic location are detected and counted in these applications the number of times that each tag is seen provides quantification of an underlying biological process as an example in digital gene expression one or more tag sequences may be analyzed for each expressed gene and the number of copies of these tags which are detected in an experiment is a measure of how actively that gene is being expressed in the tissue sample being analyzed similarly a tag sequencing approach known as chip sequencing is used to determine the locations and extent of protein and dna interactions throughout the genome 

 

snp genotyping 

 

snp genotyping is the process of determining which base a c g or t is present at a particular site in the genome within any organism the most common use of snp genotyping is for genomewide association studies gwas to look for an association between dna sequence variants and a specific phenotype of interest this is commonly done by studying the dna of individuals that are affected by a common disease or that exhibit a specific trait against the dna of control individuals who do not have this disease or trait the use of snp genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual snp or a collection of 

snps requires the analysis of millions of snp genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease for example a single large study could involve genotyping more than 1000000 snps per patient in more than 1000 patients thus requiring 1 billion assays using previously available technologies this scale of snp genotyping was both impractical and prohibitively expensive 

 

largescale snp genotyping can be used in a variety of ways including studies designed to understand the genetic contributions to disease disease association studies genomics based drug development clinical trial analysis responders and nonresponders and adverse event profiles disease predisposition testing and disease diagnosis snp genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare for example in the development of plants and animals with commercially desirable characteristics these markets will require billions of snp genotyping assays annually 

 

gene expression profiling 

 

gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mrna the intermediary messenger between genes dna and proteins variation in gene expression can cause disease or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease by comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different environments such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified studies of this type often used in drug discovery require monitoring thousands and preferably tens of thousands of mrnas in large numbers of samples once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples for example within a clinical trial 

 

as gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more costeffective technologies 

 

our technologies 

 

sequencing technology 

 

our dna sequencing technology acquired as part of the solexa merger in the first quarter of 2007 is based on the use of our sequencingbysynthesis sbs biochemistry in sbs single stranded dna is extended from a priming site one base at a time using reversible terminator nucleotides these are dna bases which can be added to a growing second strand but which initially cannot be further extended this means that at each cycle of the chemistry only one base can be added each base which is added includes a fluorescent label which is specific to the particular base thus following incorporation the fluorescence can be imaged its color determined and the base itself can be inferred once this is done an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the blocking group that had prevented further extension of the second strand this allows another base to be added and the cycle can be repeated our technology is capable of generating several billion bases of dna sequence from a single experiment with a single sample preparation the reversible terminator bases that we use are novel synthetic molecules which we manufacture they are not well incorporated by naturally occurring polymerases so we have also developed proprietary polymerase enzymes for this purpose both the nucleotides and enzymes are the subject of significant intellectual property owned by us 

 

in our dna sequencing systems we apply the sbs biochemistry on microscopic islands of dna referred to as dna clusters each cluster starts as a single dna molecule typically a few hundred bases long attached to the inside surface of a flow cell we then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create copies of each starting molecule as the copies are made they are covalently linked to the surface so they cannot diffuse away after a number of cycles of amplification each cluster might have 500 to 1000 copies of the original starting molecule but still be only about a micron onemillionth of a meter in diameter by making so many copies the fluorescent signal from each cluster is significantly increased because the clusters are so small tens of millions of clusters can be independently formed inside a single flow cell this 

large number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of sbs biochemistry and fluorescent imaging 

 

beadarray technology 

 

our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously enabling largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a unique highthroughput cost effective and flexible manner we achieve highthroughput with a high density of test sites per array and we are able to format arrays either in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various configurations in the format of standard microscope slides we seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools or sensors for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments we believe that these features have enabled our beadarray technology to become a leading platform for the highgrowth market of snp genotyping and have allowed us to be a key player in the gene expression market 

 

our proprietary beadarray technology consists of prepared beads that selfassemble into microwells etched into an array substrate we have deployed our beadarray technology in two different array formats the array matrix and the beadchip our first bead based product was the array matrix which incorporates fiber optic bundles each bundle is comprised of approximately 50000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an aluminum plate to form an array matrix beadchips are microscope slidesize silicon wafers with varying numbers of sample sites per slide both formats are chemically etched to create tens of thousands to tens of millions of wells for each sample site 

 

in a separate process we create sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make different batches of beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor for example we create a batch of snp sensors by attaching a particular dna sequence or a short segment of synthetically manufactured dna called an oligonucleotide oligo to each bead in the batch we combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to create a bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce thousands of arrays 

 

to form an array a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells one bead per well the beads in the wells comprise our individual arrays because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called “decoding” in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we employ several proprietary methods for decoding a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a functional validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each bead type multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads we believe we are the only microarray company to provide this level of quality control in the industry 

 

an experiment is performed by preparing a sample such as dna and introducing it to the array the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated beads the molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with fluorescent dye either before or after the binding the iscan or beadarray reader detects the fluorescent dye by shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the beadchip this allows the detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

 

veracode technology 

 

our proprietary veracode technology platform leverages the power of digital holographic codes to provide a robust detection method for multiplex assays requiring high precision accuracy and speed 

commercially launched in march of 2007 for the research market veracode enables lowcost multiplexing from 1 to 384plex in a single well at the heart of the veracode technology are cylindrical glass beads measuring 240 microns in length by 28 microns in diameter each veracode bead type is inscribed with a unique digital holographic code to designate and track the specific analyte or genotype of interest throughout the multiplex reaction we believe the up to 24 bits of information inscribed in each code allows for an unprecedented level of error checking improves the robustness of the optical readout process and provides a level of reliability that sets a new standard in multiplex testing unlike traditional microarrays the veracode microbeads are used in solution which takes advantage of solutionphase kinetics for more rapid hybridization times dramatically reducing the time to achieve results this technology enables us to serve a number of markets including research agriculture forensics pharmaceuticals and molecular diagnostics

we have an extensive patent portfolio including as of february 1 2009 ownership of or exclusive licenses to 135 issued us patents and 168 pending us patent applications including four allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents some of which derive from a common parent application our issued patents which are directed at various aspects of our arrays assays oligo synthesis sequencing technology instruments and chemical detection technologies expire between 2010 and 2026 we are seeking 

to extend the patents directed at the full range of our technologies we have received or filed counterparts for many of these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries 

 

we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our trade secrets to enforce our patents copyrights and trademarks to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products 

 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties which grant us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment we have exclusive licenses from tufts university to patents that are directed at our use of beadarray technology these patents were filed by dr david walt a member of our board of directors the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2010 and 2020 we also have additional nonexclusive licenses from various third parties for other components of our products in most cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect 

 

research and development 

 

we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize our sequencing beadarray veracode and oligator technologies and to support commercialization of the products and services derived from these technologies as of december 28 2008 we had a total of 406 employees engaged in research and development activities 

 

our research and development expenses for 2008 2007 and 2006 inclusive of charges relating to stockbased compensation of 141 million 100 million and 39 million respectively were 1000 million 739 million and 334 million respectively we expect research and development expense to increase during 2009 as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts 

 

marketing and distribution 

 

our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and agricultural research our potential customers include pharmaceutical biotechnology agrichemical diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic or private research centers the genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will be ultimately driven by among other items 

 

  

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america europe and asiapacific in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in smaller markets within europe and asiapacific 

we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products we expect to significantly increase our sales and distribution resources during 2009 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products 

 

manufacturing 

 

we manufacture our sequencing and array platforms reagent kits scanning equipment and oligos our manufacturing capacity for consumables has grown to support our increased customer demand during 2008 in the third quarter of 2008 we began shipping beadchips from our new singapore facility we are also focused on continuing to enhance the quality and manufacturing yield of our array matrices beadchips and flowcells to continue to increase throughput and improve the quality and manufacturing yield as we increase the complexity of our products we are exploring ways to continue increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances 

 

raw materials 

 

our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials electronic and mechanical components chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies while we have multiple commercial sources for many of our components and supplies there are some raw materials we obtain from single source suppliers if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components our business could be temporarily interrupted to mitigate this risk we can redesign our products for alternative components or use alternative reagents in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain 

 

competition 

 

although we expect that our products and services will provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression markets these include companies such as affymetrix agilent beckman coulter complete genomics fluidigm ge corp life technologies luminex pacific biosciences roche diagnostics and sequenom some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over competing products rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies although we believe that our technology and products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful 

 

segment and geographic information 

 

during the first quarter of 2008 we reorganized our operating structure into a newly created life sciences business unit which includes all products and services related to the research market namely the sequencing beadarray and beadxpress product lines we also created a diagnostics business unit to focus on the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics during 2008 we had limited activity related to the diagnostics business unit and operating results were reported on an aggregate basis to our chief operating decision maker the chief executive officer accordingly we operated in one reportable segment during 2008 

 

we currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the united states including customers in other areas of north america europe and asiapacific shipments to customers outside the united states totaled 2932 million or 51 of our total revenue during 2008 compared to 1591 million or 43 and 

815 million or 44 in 2007 and 2006 respectively sales to territories outside of the united states were generally denominated in us dollars in 2008 we reorganized our international structure to establish more efficient channels between product development product manufacturing and sales the reorganization increased our foreign subsidiaries’ anticipated dependence on the us entity for management decisions financial support production assets and inventory thereby making the foreign subsidiaries more of a direct and integral component of the us entity’s operations as a result we reassessed the primary economic environment of our foreign subsidiaries and determined the subsidiaries are more us dollar based resulting in a us dollar functional currency determination we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

 

seasonality 

 

historically customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation although demand for our products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as academic customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the government’s fiscal year 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials which subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

 

employees 

 

as of december 28 2008 we had a total of 1536 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union we consider our employee relations to be positive our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees in addition we employ a number of temporary and contract employees we face competition in this regard from other companies research and academic institutions government entities and other organizations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

 

we expect intense competition in our target markets which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell this would limit our ability to compete and maintain profitability if we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products our revenue may not grow as intended 

 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using technologies capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry flow cytometry microfluidics nanotechnology nextgeneration dna sequencing and mechanically deposited inkjet and photolithographic arrays we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards changes in customer needs emerging competition new product introductions and strong price competition for example prices per data point for genotyping have fallen significantly over the last two years and we anticipate that prices will continue to fall one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could develop competing products for example during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 life technologies previously referred to as applied biosystems group a business segment of applera corporation launched the solid tm system  its next generation sequencing technology if we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

 

negative conditions in global credit markets may result in delayed payments from our customers and may negatively impact our smaller suppliers 

 

the recent economic conditions and market turbulence may impact the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers certain of our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us if that were to occur our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding could increase additionally these economic conditions may cause our smaller suppliers to be unable to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized components which would impair our ability to manufacture on schedule and at commercially reasonable costs in addition due to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 

 

in addition our business depends on the overall demand for methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function we rely in large part on the research and development spending of our customers which is often discretionary and the recent economic downturn has caused many companies to reduce their research and development budgets if the current worldwide economic downturn continues our customers may delay or reduce their purchases of our products and services a reduction in demand will reduce our revenues and harm our profitability 

 

due to our increasing foreign operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations 

 

we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets we have sales offices located internationally throughout europe and the asia pacific region as well as manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom and singapore during 2008 the majority of our sales to international customers and purchases of raw materials from international suppliers were denominated in the us dollar changes in the value of the 

relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market 

 

our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the us dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive impacting our ability to compete our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they may raise their prices as the value of the us dollar decreases relative to their local currency 

 

foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations the recent global financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue and thus adversely impact our business or financial conditions 

 

if we are unable to find thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture components of our products we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources for example we currently use multiple components in our products that are singlesourced if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components we will be unable to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 

 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

 

we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies 

 

our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies including the life sciences and healthcare industries thus we will need to add new personnel including management and develop the expertise of existing management the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 

 

we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth these difficulties could impair our profitability 

 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans which will place a strain on our human and capital resources if we are unable to manage this growth effectively our profitability could suffer our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 

a significant portion of our sales is to international customers 

 

shipments to customers outside the united states comprised 51 43 and 44 of our revenue for the years ended december 28 2008 december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively we intend to continue to expand our international presence by selling to customers located outside of the us and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow export sales entail a variety of risks including 

 

  

in addition we are also subject to general geopolitical risks such as political social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions that could adversely affect our business specifically the effective launch and customer acceptance of new technology platforms 

 

we have made and may in the future make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services or technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to 

 

  

acquisitions and other transactions are inherently risky and our previous or future transactions may not be successful the inability to effectively manage the risks associated with these transactions could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

any inability to protect effectively our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position 

 

our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in protecting their proprietary rights abroad these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights abroad 

 

the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries including our patent position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued questions as to inventorship may also arise any finding that our patents and applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies also our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 

 

we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and have taken security measures to protect this information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information among other things we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants nevertheless employees collaborators or consultants may still disclose our confidential information and we may not otherwise be able to protect effectively our trade secrets accordingly others may gain access to our confidential information or may independently develop substantially equivalent information or techniques 

 

litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services or impact our stock price 

 

our commercial success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and on our ability to protect our own intellectual property third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have a material adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize and sell products and could result in the 

award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and maintain profitability 

 

changes in our effective income tax rate could impact our profitability 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax laws or tax rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions and the result of examinations by various tax authorities 

 

if we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

we continue to ramp up our capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our business plan for 2009 there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

 

additionally we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and hayward california singapore and little chesterford united kingdom these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods if a natural disaster were to significantly damage one of our facilities or if other events were to cause our operations to fail we may be unable to manufacture our products provide our services or develop new products 

 

also many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and would prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

we expect that our results of operations will fluctuate this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 

 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue a large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars accordingly if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

 

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function namely sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and biological function in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to sustain profitability 

 

loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes 

 

we could lose some or all of the tax deduction for interest expense associated with our 4000 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2014 if the foregoing notes are not subject to the special treasury regulations governing integration of certain debt instruments the notes are converted or we invest in nontaxable investments 

 

we may not be able to sustain operating profitability 

 

prior to 2006 we had incurred net losses each year since our inception and in 2007 we reported a net loss of 2784 million reflecting significant charges associated with our acquisition of solexa in january 2007 and the settlement of our litigation with affymetrix as of december 28 2008 our accumulated deficit was 3325 million our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses noncash stockbased compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability we expect to continue incurring significant expenses related to research and development sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products and the continued development of our manufacturing capabilities in addition we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products although we have regained profitability we may not be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly basis 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio 

 

our investment securities consist of marketable debt securities including treasury bills and commercial paper with strong credit ratings corporate bonds and short maturity mutual funds providing similar financial returns additionally as of december 28 2008 we had 559 million of auction rate securities issued primarily by municipalities and universities these securities are debt instruments with a longterm maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions our entire auction rate portfolio is held in a brokerage account with ubs financial services inc a subsidiary of ubs ag ubs and is currently rated aaa or aa by a rating agency beginning in february 2008 these auction rate securities became illiquid because their scheduled auctions failed to settle an auction failure occurs when the parties wishing to sell securities at auction cannot as of december 28 2008 the securities continued to fail auction and remained illiquid 

 

various regulatory agencies initiated investigations into the sales and marketing practices of several banks and brokerdealers including ubs which sold auction rate securities alleging violations of federal and state laws along with several other brokerdealers ubs subsequently reached a settlement with the federal and state regulators that required them to repurchase auction rate securities from certain investors at par at some future date in november 2008 we signed a settlement agreement to sell our auction rate securities at par value to ubs during the period of june 30 2010 through july 2 2012 

 

the settlement agreement with ubs and the associated put option mitigates the risk of loss on our auction rate security portfolio however given the negative conditions in the global credit markets there is still risk that ubs may not be able to fulfill its obligation

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

in the recent past we incurred substantial costs in defending ourselves against patent infringement and patent ownership claims and expect going forward to devote substantial financial and managerial resources to protect our intellectual property and to defend against any future claims asserted against us from time to time we may also be parties to other litigation in the ordinary course of business while the results of any litigation are uncertain management does not believe the ultimate resolution of its legal matters will result in a material adverse impact to us

on december 26 2006 the applied biosystems group of applera corporation applied biosystems filed suit in california superior court santa clara county against solexa which we acquired on january 26 2007 this state court action related to the ownership of several patents assigned in 1995 to solexa’s predecessor company lynx therapeutics by a former employee dr stephen macevicz who is the inventor of these patents and is named as a codefendant in the suit the macevicz patents are directed to methods for sequencing dna us pat nos 5750341 and 6306597 using successive rounds of oligonucleotide probe ligation sequencingbyligation and to a probe 5969119 used in connection with these sequencing methods lynx was originally a unit of applied biosystems but was spun out in 1992 on may 31 2007 applied biosystems filed a second suit this time against us in the us district court for the northern district of california this second suit sought a declaratory judgment of noninfringement of the macevicz patents that were the subject of the state court action mentioned above both suits were later consolidated in the us district court for the northern district of california san francisco division by these consolidated actions applied biosytems was seeking ownership of the three macevicz patents unspecified costs and damages and a declaration of noninfringement and invalidity of these patents applied biosystems was not asserting any claim for patent infringement against us 

 

on january 5 2009 the case went to trial in two phases the first phase addressed the determination of ownership of the patentsinsuit and the second phase addressed whether these patents were valid and infringed by applied biosystems on january 14 2009 at the end of the first phase a federal jury determined that solexa was the rightful owner of all three macevicz patents on january 27 2009 the same jury found that applied biosystems did not infringe the ’119 probe patent and that the ’119 patent was valid in august 2008 the court had ruled that applied biosystems’ twobase system did not infringe the ’341 and ’597 patents prior to the jury finding of noninfringement of the ’119 patent applied biosystems conceded its onebase system infringed claim 1 of the ’597 patent and solexa conceded invalidity of that same claim under the court’s construction of that claim both parties reserved the right to appeal the court’s construction of claim 1 of the ’597 patent among other things 

 

our genome analyzer products use a different technology called sequencingbysynthesis sbs which is not covered by any of the macevicz patents in addition we have no plans to use any of the sequencingbyligation technologies covered by these patents

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to provide an overview of the business to help facilitate an understanding of significant factors influencing our historical operating results financial condition and cash flows and also to convey our expectations of the potential impact of known trends events or uncertainties that may impact our future results the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with “item 6 selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the discussion and analysis in this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and adequacy of resources words such as “anticipate” “believe” “continue” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “may” “plan” “potential” “predict” “project” or similar words or phrases or the negatives of these words may identify forwardlooking statements but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking examples of forwardlooking statements include among others statements regarding the integration of our acquired technologies with our existing technology the commercial launch of new products and the duration which our existing cash and other resources is expected to fund our operating activities 

 

forwardlooking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in “item 1a risk factors” as well as those discussed elsewhere the risk factors and other cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as applying to all related forwardlooking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form 10k 

 

overview 

 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function using our proprietary technologies we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing genotyping and gene expression markets in the future we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics our customers include leading genomic research centers pharmaceutical companies academic institutions clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 

 

on january 26 2007 we completed the acquisition of solexa for 262 million shares of our common stock as a result of that acquisition we develop and commercialize genetic analysis technologies used to perform a range of analyses including whole genome resequencing gene expression analysis and small rna analysis we believe we are the only company with genomescale technology for sequencing genotyping and gene expression the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 

 

during the first quarter of 2008 we reorganized our operating structure into two newly created business segments life sciences and diagnostics during 2008 the diagnostics business unit had limited business activity and accordingly operating results were reported on an aggregate basis as one operating segment in the future at each reporting period end we will reassess our reportable operating segments particularly as we enter the market for molecular diagnostics 

 

on august 1 2008 we completed the acquisition of avantome as consideration for the acquisition we paid 258 million in cash and may pay up to an additional 350 million in contingent cash consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones avantome is a development stage company working on developing lowcost long read sequencing technology we expect this technology if and when available as a product to have applicability to both the research and diagnostic markets 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and service projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 

 

as of december 28 2008 our accumulated deficit was 3325 million and total stockholders’ equity was 8486 million our losses have principally occurred as a result of acquired inprocess research and development iprd charges of 247 million related to our acquisition of avantome in 2008 and 3034 million related to our acquisition of solexa in 2007 the substantial resources required for the research development and manufacturing scaleup effort required to commercialize our products and services and a charge of 545 million in 2007 primarily related to settlement of our litigation with affymetrix we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research and development over the next several years we will also need to increase our selling general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems other products and services 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future actual results may be different from the estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue consists of sales of arrays reagents flow cells instrumentation oligonucleotides oligos and associated freight charges service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services extended warranty sales and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 

 

we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 104 revenue recognition  under sab no 104 revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured all revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 

 

revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of instrumentation is recognized when earned which is generally upon shipment revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable we ensure there are no refund rights if payment terms are based on future performance or a right of return exists we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment changes in judgments and estimates regarding application of sab no 104 might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized 

 

sales of instrumentation generally include a standard oneyear warranty we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts which are generally for one or two years upon the expiration of the initial warranty revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates gross margins could be adversely affected 

 

while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions emerging issues task force eitf no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine that the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

 

investments 

 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 157 fair value measurement  in february 2008 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no sfas 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157  which provides a oneyear deferral of the effective date of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually in october 2008 the fasb issued fasb fsp sfas 1573 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  the fsp clarifies the application of fasb statement no 157 fair value measurements  in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 

 

we determine fair value of our financial assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 157 and 1573 fair value is defined under sfas no 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 157 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable that may be used to measure fair value 

 

 26 

 

in using this fair value hierarchy and the framework established by sfas no 157 management may be required to make assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value these assumptions are judgmental in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycle and development plans product expiration and quality issues historical experience and our current inventory levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

 

contingencies 

 

we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses if losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 

 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

 

we make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and litigation settlements 

 

in determining the carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets arising from acquisitions we use the purchase method of accounting the purchase method of accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired including iprd goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to at least annual impairment tests the amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization and the amount assigned to iprd is expensed immediately 

 

determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets acquired as part of litigation settlements also requires the exercise of judgment while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets one method used by management is the discounted cash flow method this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in this type of analysis in addition other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results our judgments can also change with respect to the estimated life of intangible assets which could increase or decrease related amortization expense 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projection and timing of future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows perpetual growth rates determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect if our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets we could incur additional impairment charges we have performed our annual test of goodwill as of may 30 2008 noting no impairment no indicators have arisen since management’s assessment on may 30 2008 that would require further assessment 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets if indicators of impairment exist we assess the recoverability of the affected longlived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows if impairment is indicated we measure the future discounted cash flows associated with the use of the asset and adjust the value of the asset accordingly certain estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of longlived assets these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the recognition of an impairment charge and the magnitude of any such change if our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets we could incur additional impairment charges 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r sharebased payment under the provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fairvalue as calculated by the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility forfeiture rates and expected option life if any of these assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

 

income taxes 

 

in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future determination of cumulative pretax book income after 

permanent differences history of earnings and reliability of forecasting as of december 28 2008 we have maintained a valuation allowance only against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the “more likely than not” threshold required under sfas no 109 

 

due to the adoption of sfas no 123r we recognize excess tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to sharebased compensation have been realized we follow the withandwithout approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions under this approach excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 

 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions fin no 48 requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 

 

results of operations 

 

to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 28 2008 december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 stated as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

comparison of years ended december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 

 

our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the years ended december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 were both 52 weeks 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

product revenue consists of revenue from the sale of consumables instruments oligos and associated freight charges the increase in product revenue was driven primarily by sales of our infinium beadchips sequencing systems and sequencing consumables consumables and instruments constituted 63 and 35 of product revenue for the year ended december 28 2008 respectively compared to 59 and 37 for the year ended december 30 2007 respectively 

 

consumable revenue increased by 1402 million over prior year growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our infinium and sequencing products which led to increased sales of 1048 million and 354 million respectively the increase in revenue associated with our infinium products can be mainly attributed to the strong demand for our infinium highdensity beadchips particularly the human610quad which we began shipping during the first quarter of 2008 of the overall increase in infinium beadchip sales approximately 79 is due to new product introductions with higher average selling prices while the remaining 21 can be attributed to increased volume the increase in sequencing consumables is primarily attributable to the growth in our installed base of instruments and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale 

 

instrument revenue increased by 648 million over prior year of which 630 million was due to increased sales of our sequencing systems this increase in revenue can be primarily attributed to shipments of our second generation genome analyzer the genome analyzer ii gaii additionally during the second quarter of 2008 we launched the iscan system our nextgeneration beadchip scanner to replace the beadarray reader any increase in revenue resulting from shipments of this new system was offset by a reduction in sales of our beadarray reader as we stopped manufacturing this product upon the launch of our iscan system 

 

we expect to see continued growth in product revenue which can be mainly attributed to the anticipated launch of several new products sales of existing products and the growth of our installed base of instruments 

 

service and other revenue includes revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing service contracts extended warranty contracts and research revenue the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to an increase of 31 million in extended warranty sales coupled with an increase of 20 million in sequencing service contracts this increase was substantially offset by a decline of 47 million in our fast track genotyping service contracts as we shift more towards cspro certified customers cspro is a collaborative program through which we certify third party service partners using our products to ensure delivery of performance and data quality equivalent to that available from our internal service offering the decline in service revenue as a result of the shift to cspro certified customers has been offset by the resulting increase in our consumable sales to these third party service providers if product sales increase we expect to see continued increases in the sale of our extended warranty contracts we also expect sales from snp genotyping and sequencing service contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis depending on the mix the number of contracts completed and the success of our certified service providers the timing of 

completion of snp genotyping and sequencing service contracts is highly dependent on the customers’ schedules for delivering the snps and samples to us 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue 

 

 

 

cost of revenue which excludes impairment of manufacturing equipment and amortization of intangible assets represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead installation warranty packaging and delivery costs as well as costs associated with performing genotyping and sequencing services on behalf of our customers 

 

the increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by higher instrument and consumable sales cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was 36 for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to 37 for the year ended december 30 2007 the decrease is primarily due to favorable product mix driven by increased sales of our new highdensity infinium beadchips with higher average selling prices as compared to the infinium beadchips sold in the prior year this was partially offset by increased provisions for inventory obsolescence of 72 million for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to 19 million for the year ended december 30 2007 the increase in the inventory reserve is primarily associated with product transitions during the year we recorded reserves for product obsolescence associated with the launch of our new infinium beadchips and the launch of a new sequencing kit instrument cost of sales as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly over the prior year due to lower average selling prices mainly associated with promotional campaigns as we launched our next generation beadarray reader the iscan in the first half of 2008 

 

cost of service and other revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to higher extended warranty contract revenue cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of related revenue stayed consistent at 31 

 

research and development expenses 

 

 

 

our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design development testing and enhancement of our products we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 

 

research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 17 for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to 20 for the year ended december 30 2007 however there was an overall increase in research and development expenditures compared to the prior year costs to support our beadarray technology research activities increased 104 million for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to the year ended december 30 2007 primarily due to an overall increase in personnelrelated expenses increased lab and material expenses associated with the establishment of our manufacturing facility in singapore and the development of new products the continued development of our sequencing technology resulted in increased research and development expenditures of 91 million for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to the year ended december 30 2007 in addition noncash stockbased compensation expense increased by 41 million compared to the year ended december 30 2007 accrued compensation expense of 15 million 

associated with contingent consideration for the avantome acquisition completed on august 1 2008 and expenses related to the development of our newly created diagnostics business unit of 09 million also contributed to the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december 28 2008 

 

we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets accordingly we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing finance human resources business development legal and general management as well as professional fees such as expenses for legal and accounting services selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26 for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to 28 for the year ended december 30 2007 selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 included stockbased compensation expenses totaling 285 million and 194 million respectively 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased 341 million for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to the year ended december 30 2007 the increase is primarily due to increases of 293 million attributable to personnelrelated expenses including salaries benefits and commissions to support the growth of our business included as part of these personnel related expenses is an increase in employee travel expenses of 45 million due to increased headcount and continued international expansion the remaining 48 million variance is comprised of increases to nonpersonnelrelated costs of 29 million consisting mainly of sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products and an increase of 19 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense 

 

general and administrative expense increased 127 million during the year ended december 28 2008 compared to the year ended december 30 2007 due to increases of 104 million in personnelrelated expenses associated with the growth of our business 72 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense and 09 million in outside consulting services offset by a decrease of 58 million in legal costs primarily related to the settlement of the affymetrix litigation during the first quarter of 2008 

 

we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the expected growth in our business 

 

impairment of manufacturing equipment 

 

 

 

the impairment of manufacturing equipment resulted from our assessment of recoverability on a portion of our imaging and decoding systems that were no longer being utilized due to the development of our nextgeneration system and our transition to the infinium hd product line 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

 

 

amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenue was 2 and 1 respectively for the year ended december 28 2008 and year ended december 30 2007 the increase in amortization expense is primarily due to the settlement of our lawsuit with affymetrix on january 9 2008 resulting in the recording of an intangible asset of 360 million see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this settlement 

 

we began amortizing this asset during the first quarter of 2008 causing an increase in amortization of intangible assets of 78 million for the year ended december 28 2008 the additional increase of 02 million during the year ended december 28 2008 as compared to the year ended december 30 2007 represents an additional month of amortization associated with the assets acquired from solexa that we began amortizing in february 2007 

 

acquired inprocess research and development 

 

 

 

as a result of the avantome acquisition in august 2008 and the solexa acquisition in january 2007 we recorded acquired iprd charges of 247 million and 3034 million respectively see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions 

 

litigation settlements 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 30 2007 we recorded a charge of 545 million associated with two settlement agreements the total charge is comprised primarily of 540 million related to a 900 million settlement with affymetrix entered into on january 9 2008 for certain patent litigation between the parties see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the affymetrix settlement 

 

interest income 

 

 

 

interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments decreased 35 million during the year ended december 28 2008 compared to the year ended december 30 2007 the decrease was primarily driven by the overall decline in interest rates due to current market conditions coupled with a change in our cash and investment portfolio to a mix of shorter duration maturities and an increased number of agencyrated investments 

interest and other expense net 

 

 

 

interest and other expense net consists of interest expense and other income and expenses primarily related to net foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses interest and other expense net increased 15 million for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to the year ended december 30 2007 

 

interest expense related to our convertible debt issued in february 2007 was 40 million and 36 million respectively for the year ended december 28 2008 and the year ended december 30 2007 the increase represents an additional month and a half of interest expense recorded in the year ended december 28 2008 compared to the year ended december 30 2007 

 

in addition we recorded 19 million in net foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended december 28 2008 compared to immaterial losses recorded in the year ended december 30 2007 the gains resulting from our net foreign currency transactions for the year ended december 28 2008 are due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates coupled with a change in our foreign entity functional currency designation from the local currency to the us dollar beginning the third quarter of 2008 as a result of this change in the third quarter we began remeasuring our foreign subsidiaries’ nonmonetary assets and liabilities and related income and expense accounts to the us dollar and recording the resulting net gain as income previously under local functional currency designation the effects of translation were recorded within stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income loss 

 

provision benefit for income taxes 

 

 

 

the provision consists of federal state and foreign income tax expense for the years ended december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 respectively in addition for the year ended december 30 2007 the provision was reduced by 171 million as a result of the release of the valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets 

 

as of december 28 2008 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of 877 million and 1483 million respectively which begin to expire in 2025 and 2013 respectively unless previously utilized in addition we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of 126 million and 139 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019 respectively unless previously utilized 

 

pursuant to section 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization previous limitations due to section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of december 28 2008 

 

based on the available evidence as of december 28 2008 we were not able to conclude it was more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance of 28 million and 124 million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets respectively at december 30 2007 we concluded that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized and accordingly we released a portion of our valuation allowance 171 million of which was recorded as a reduction to the tax provision 

as of december 28 2008 no material changes have been made to our uncertain tax positions recorded in accordance with fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109

revenue 

 

 

 

product revenue consists of revenue from the sale of consumables instruments oligos and associated freight charges consumables and instruments constituted 59 and 37 of product revenue for the year ended december 30 2007 respectively compared to 64 and 28 for the year ended december 31 2006 respectively the change in sales associated with our product mix is due to increased sales in instruments primarily attributable to the genome analyzer which was introduced during the first quarter of 2007 growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our infinium products 

 

consumable revenue increased by 936 million over prior year of which 811 million primarily represents increased sales volume of our infinium products the increase in revenue associated with our infinium products can be mainly attributed to our humanhap family of beadchips the human 1m dna analysis beadchip and our iselect infinium beadchips for more focused content applications of the overall increase in infinium beadchip sales approximately 82 is due to a higher volume of shipments while the remaining 18 can be attributed to new product introductions and slightly higher average selling prices 

 

instrument revenue increased by 776 million over prior year of which 687 million was due to increased sales of our sequencing systems particularly the genome analyzer and cluster stations 

 

service and other revenue includes revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing service contracts extended warranty contracts and research revenue service and other revenue increased 113 million over prior year primarily due to the completion of several significant infinium and iselect custom snp genotyping service contracts and sequencing services contracts this increase in services represented 99 million of the variance while the remainder of the difference was generated by an increase in extended warranty contracts of 22 million offset by a decrease in grant revenue of 08 million we expect sales from snp genotyping and sequencing services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed the timing of completion of snp genotyping and sequencing services contracts are highly dependent on the customers’ schedules for delivering the snps and samples to us 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue 

 

 

cost of revenue which excludes amortization of intangible assets represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead installation warranty packaging and delivery costs as well as costs associated with performing genotyping and sequencing services on behalf of our customers 

 

the increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by higher instrument and consumable sales cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was 37 for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 33 for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase is primarily due to the shift in product mix towards instruments mainly attributable to sales of our sequencing systems which were introduced during the first quarter of 2007 in addition cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was adversely impacted by the increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense as well as 07 million associated with the amortization of inventory revaluation costs related to our acquisition of solexa in january 2007 noncash stockbased compensation expense was 40 million and 13 million for the periods ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

 

cost of service revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to higher sequencing and genotyping services revenue cost of service revenue as a percentage of related revenue was 31 for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 28 for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in cost of service revenue as a percentage of related revenue was primarily related to unfavorable product mix driven by higher sales of our sequencing services which were introduced during 2007

interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 160 million and 54 million for the years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the increase in interest income over the prior year was primarily driven by higher cash balances from the proceeds of our february 2007 convertible debt offering cash acquired as part of the solexa acquisition and improved operating cash flow in addition we experienced higher effective interest rates on our cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

interest and other expense net

interest expense was 36 million for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to an immaterial amount for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase is primarily related to our convertible debt offering in february 2007 for the years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 we recorded 05 million and 04 million respectively in net foreign currency transaction losses respectively in 2007 these foreign currency exchange losses were offset by 05 million of foreign currency exchange gains associated with the sale of our secured convertible debentures with genizon biosciences inc in the fourth quarter of 2007 

 

provision benefit for income taxes 

 

 

 

the provision benefit for income taxes was 104 million and 27 million for the years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the provision consists of federal state and foreign income tax expense offset in 2007 by the release of the valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets 

 

during the year ended december 30 2007 we utilized 729 million and 108 million of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards respectively to reduce our federal and state income taxes as of december 30 2007 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of 287 million and 991 million respectively which begin to expire in 2025 and 2015 respectively unless previously utilized in addition we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit 

carryforwards of 92 million and 93 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019 respectively unless previously utilized 

 

pursuant to section 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization previous limitations due to section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of december 30 2007 

 

as of december 30 2007 we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized and accordingly we released a portion of our valuation allowance 171 million of which was recorded as a reduction to the tax provision in addition we established current and long term deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheets of 268 million and 801 million respectively and decreased the goodwill balances recorded in conjunction with the cyvera and solexa acquisitions by 21 million and 184 million respectively based upon the available evidence as of december 30 2007 we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance of 29 million and 254 million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets respectively 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cashflow 

 

 

 

historically our sources of cash have included 

 

  

our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with 

 

 39 

 

other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include 

 

  

we currently invest our funds in treasury notes commercial paper auction rate securities corporate bonds and us dollarbased short maturity mutual funds we do not hold securities backed by mortgages 

 

as of december 28 2008 we had cash cash equivalents and investments of 6960 million compared to 3861 million as of december 30 2007 included in the investment balance as of december 28 2008 were auction rate securities of 559 million issued primarily by municipalities and universities the markets for auction rate securities effectively ceased when the vast majority of auctions failed in february 2008 preventing investors from selling their auction rate securities as of december 28 2008 the securities continued to fail auction and remained illiquid as a result we have recorded an unrealized loss of 87 million for the year ended december 28 2008 resulting in a reduction to the fair value of our auction rate securities to 472 million as of december 28 2008 this value was determined in accordance with sfas no 157 we used level 3 hierarchical inputs due to the lack of actively traded market data including management’s assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk we based our fair value determination on estimated discounted future cash flows of interest income over a projected period reflective of the length of time we anticipate it will take the securities to become liquid additionally we classified these securities as longterm investments as of december 28 2008 as we believe we may not be able to liquidate our investments within the next year as of december 30 2007 these securities were classified as shortterm as the failures of these auctions did not occur until february 2008 

 

in november 2008 we signed a settlement agreement allowing us to sell our auction rate securities at par value to ubs at our discretion during the period of june 30 2010 through july 2 2012 to account for this settlement agreement we recorded a put option of 87 million and recognized a corresponding gain in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008 the fair value of the put option was determined using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest rates timing and amount of cash flow with consideration given to ubs’s financial ability to repurchase the auction rate securities beginning june 30 2010 the fair value of the put option approximates the difference between the par value and fair value of the auction rate securities the auction rate securities were previously classified as availableforsale and unrealized gains and losses were recognized in other comprehensive income by signing the settlement agreement we no longer have the intent of holding the auction rate securities until recovery as we will now recover any unrealized loss through the settlement agreement accordingly we elected a onetime transfer of the auction rate securities from availableforsale to trading and reclassified previously recorded unrealized losses from other comprehensive income to earnings we will continue to recognize gains and losses in earnings approximately equal to changes in the fair value of the auction rate securities at each balance sheet date these gains and losses will likely be offset by changes in the fair value of the put option as we elect the fair value option subject to our assessment of the counterparties ability to perform see part i item 1a “risk factors — negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio” 

 

the primary inflow of cash during the year ended december 28 2008 was from the sale of 8050000 shares of our common stock to the public in august 2008 at a public offering price of 4375 per share raising net proceeds to us of 3426 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses additional cash inflows during this year resulted from the sale and maturity of our investments in availableforsale securities of 4118 million and 443 million from the exercise of our stock options 

 

the primary cash outflows during the year ended december 28 2008 were attributable to the purchase of availableforsale securities for 5687 million the onetime payment of 900 million made to affymetrix in accordance with the settlement agreement the repurchase of an aggregate of 31 million shares of our 

common stock for 708 million and 597 million in capital expenditures primarily for constructioninprogress associated with the expansion of our san diego facilities additions to manufacturing equipment as well as the development of our manufacturing facility in singapore additionally on august 1 2008 we completed our acquisition of avantome inc as consideration for the acquisition we paid 258 million in cash including transaction costs and may pay up to an additional 350 million in contingent cash consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones 

 

our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include expenditures related to 

 

  

we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

 

our outstanding convertible notes became convertible into cash and if applicable shares of our common stock as of april 1 2008 the notes continued to be convertible through december 31 2008 subsequent to year end on december 29 2008 a noteholder converted notes in an aggregate principal amount of 100 million generally upon conversion of a note we must pay the conversion value of the note in cash up to the principal amount of the note any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount is payable in shares of our common stock to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes we entered into a hedge transaction see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes beginning january 1 2009 the notes ceased to be convertible since the trigger for convertibility was not met during the last calendar quarter of 2008 fluctuations in our stock price could cause the conversion feature to trigger in future quarters resulting in an impact on our working capital 

 

we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next twelve months barring unforeseen circumstances operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures at the present time we have no material commitments for capital expenditures other than development of our additional facility in little chesterford united kingdom the development of this facility is estimated to cost 145 million during 2009 although actual costs may vary significantly from our current estimate our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including 

 

  

as a result of the factors listed above we may require additional funding in the future our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes during the fiscal year ended december 28 2008 we were not involved in any “off balance sheet arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the securities and exchange commission 

 

contractual obligations 

 

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december 28 2008 aggregated by type amounts in thousands

interest rate sensitivity 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not 

materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments for example if a 100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2009 our interest income would change by approximately 64 million in relation to amounts we would expect to earn based on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 28 2008 

 

market price sensitive instruments 

 

in order to potentially reduce equity dilution we entered into convertible note hedge transactions entitling us to purchase up to 18322320 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 2183 per share subject to adjustment in addition we sold to the counterparties warrants exercisable on a netshare basis for up to 18322320 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 31435 per share subject to adjustment the antidilutive effect of the note hedge transactions if any could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants which occur during 2014 assuming the warrants are exercised 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we have operations in the americas europe and asiapacific as a result our financial position results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the functional currency for each of our subsidiaries is the us dollar accordingly we remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries to the us dollar at monthend exchange rates and remeasure the nonmonetary assets and liabilities to the us dollar at historical rates income and expense amounts related to monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the us dollar at the weighted average exchange rates in effect during the relevant period and income and expense accounts related to nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the us dollar at historical exchange rates remeasurement gains and losses are recognized as income or expense in the period of occurrence 

 

in addition many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity’s us functional currency these transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency the value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income the net currency exchange gain recognized on business transactions was 19 million for the year ended december 28 2008 and is included in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations

industry background 

 

genetic variation and biological function 

 

every person inherits two copies of each gene one from each parent the two copies of each gene may be identical or they may be different these differences are referred to as genetic variation examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color genetic variation can also have important medical consequences genetic variation affects disease susceptibility including predisposition to cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease in addition genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug treatment some people may respond well others may not respond at all and still others may experience adverse side effects a common form of genetic variation is a singlenucleotide polymorphism or snp a snp is a variation in a single position in a dna sequence it is estimated that the human genome contains over nine million snps 

 

while in some cases a single snp will be responsible for medically important effects it is now believed that combinations of snps may contribute to the development of most major diseases since there are millions of snps it is important to investigate many representative wellchosen snps simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable information 

 

another contributor to disease and dysfunction is the over or underexpression of genes within an organism’s cells a very complex network of genes interacts to maintain health in complex organisms the challenge for scientists is to delineate the associated genes’ expression patterns and their relationship to disease until recently this problem was addressed by investigating effects on a genebygene basis this is time consuming and difficulties exist when several pathways cannot be observed or “controlled” at the same time with the advent of microarray technology thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time 

 

snp genotyping 

 

snp genotyping is the process of determining which base a c g or t is present at a particular site in the genome within an individual or other organism the use of snp genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual snp or a collection of snps and to apply that information to clinical trials and diagnostic testing requires the analysis of millions of snp genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease for example a single large clinical trial could involve genotyping 1000000 snps per patient in 1000 patients thus requiring 1 billion assays using previously available technologies this scale of snp genotyping was both impractical and prohibitively expensive 

 

largescale snp genotyping can be used in a variety of ways including studies designed to understand the genetic contributions to disease disease association studies genomicsbased drug development clinical trial analysis disease predisposition testing and disease diagnosis snp genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare for example in the development of plants and animals with desirable commercial characteristics these markets will require billions of snp genotyping assays annually 

gene expression profiling 

 

gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mrna the intermediary messenger between genes dna and proteins variation in gene expression can cause disease or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease by comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different environments such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified studies of this type often used in drug discovery require monitoring thousands and preferably tens of thousands of mrnas in large numbers of samples once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples for example within a clinical trial 

 

as gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more costeffective technologies 

 

sequencing 

 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of bases a c g or t in a dna sample which can be further divided into de novo sequencing resequencing and tag sequencing in de novo sequencing the goal is to determine the sequence of a representative sample from a species never before sequenced understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between many species can help to improve our understanding of the function of the structures found in the dna 

 

in resequencing the sequence of samples from a given species is determined generally comparing each to a standard or reference sequence this is an extremely comprehensive form of genotyping in which every single base is characterized for possible mutations in tag sequencing short sequences each representative of a larger molecule or genomic location are detected and counted in these applications the number of times that each tag is seen provides quantification of an underlying biological process as an example in digital gene expression one tag sequence may exist for each gene and the number of copies of this tag which are detected in an experiment is a measure of how actively that gene is being expressed in the tissue sample being analyzed 

our technologies 

 

beadarray technology 

 

we have developed a proprietary array technology that enables the largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously our beadarray technology provides a unique combination of high throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility we achieve high throughput with a high density of test sites per array and we are able to format arrays either in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various configurations in the format of standard microscope slides we seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools or sensors for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments we believe that these features have enabled our beadarray technology to become a leading platform for the emerging highgrowth market of snp genotyping and expect they will enable us to become a key player in the gene expression market 

 

our proprietary beadarray technology combines microwells etched into a substrate and specially prepared beads that selfassemble into an array we have deployed our beadarray technology in two different array formats the array matrix and the beadchip our first beadbased product was the array matrix which incorporates fiber optic bundles the fiber optic bundles which we cut into lengths of less than one inch are manufactured to our specifications each bundle is comprised of approximately 50000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an aluminum plate which forms an array matrix beadchips are fabricated in microscope slideshaped sizes with varying numbers of sample sites per slide both formats are chemically etched to create tens to hundreds of thousands of wells for each sample site 

 

in a separate process we create sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make different batches of beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor for example we create a batch of snp sensors by attaching a particular dna sequence or oligo to each bead in the batch we combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to create a bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce thousands of arrays 

 

to form an array a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells one bead per well the tens of thousands of beads in the wells comprise our individual arrays because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called ’decoding’ in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we employ several proprietary methods for decoding a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each bead type multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads we believe we are the only microarray company to provide this level of quality control in the industry 

 

an experiment is performed by preparing a sample such as dna from a patient and introducing it to the array the design features of our array matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution containing the sample whereas our beadchip allows processing of samples on a slidesized platform the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated bead these molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with a fluorescent dye either before or after the binding the beadarray reader detects the fluorescent dye by shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the beadchip this allows the detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

sequencing technology 

 

our dna sequencing technology acquired as part of the solexa merger that was completed on january 26 2007 is based on the use of our sequencingbysynthesis sbs biochemistry in sbs single stranded dna is extended from a priming site one base at a time using reversible terminator nucleotides these are dna bases which can be added to a growing second strand but which initially cannot be further extended this means that at each cycle of the chemistry only one base can be added each base which is added includes a fluorescent label which is specific to the particular base thus following incorporation the fluorescence can be imaged its color determined and the base itself can be inferred once this is done an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the block that had prevented further extension of the second strand this allows another base to be added and the cycle can be repeated we have shown data in which this cycle is repeated up to 50 times thus determining dna sequences which are up to 50 bases long this may well increase in the future as we further develop this technology the reversible terminator bases which we use are novel synthetic molecules which we manufacture they are not well incorporated by naturally occurring polymerases so we have also developed proprietary enzymes for this purpose both the nucleotides and enzymes are the subject of significant intellectual property 

 

in our dna sequencing systems we apply the sbs biochemistry on microscopic islands of dna these are called dna clusters each cluster starts as a single dna molecule typically a few hundred bases long attached to the inside surface of a flow cell we then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create copies of each starting molecule as the copies are made they are covalently linked to the surface so they cannot diffuse away after a number of cycles of amplification each cluster might have 500 to 1000 copies of the original starting molecule but still be only about a micron onemillionth of a meter in diameter by making so many copies the fluorescent signal from each cluster is significantly increased because the clusters are so small though tens of millions of clusters can be independently formed inside a single flow cell this large number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of sbs biochemistry and electronic imaging 

 

veracode technology 

 

the beadarray technology is most effective in applications which require mid to high levels of multiplexing from low to high levels of throughput multiplexing refers to the number of individual pieces of information that are simultaneously extracted from one sample we believe the molecular diagnostics market will require systems which are extremely high throughput and cost effective in the mid to lowmultiplex range to address this market we acquired the veracode technology through our acquisition of cyvera corporation in april 2005 based on digitally encoded microbeads veracode enables lowcost multiplexing from 1 to 384plex in a single well we began shipping the beadxpress system which uses the veracode technology during the first quarter of 2007 along with several assays for the system we believe that this system enables lower multiplex genotyping gene expression and protein based assays in the research market we expect our customers to utilize our beadarray technology for their higher multiplex projects and then move to our beadxpress system for their lower multiplex projects utilizing the same assays 

 

oligator technology 

 

genomic applications require many different short pieces of dna that can be made synthetically called oligos we have developed our proprietary oligator technology for the parallel synthesis of many different oligos to meet the requirements of largescale genomics applications we believe that our oligator technology is substantially more cost effective and provides significantly higher throughput than available commercial alternatives our synthesis machines are computer controlled and utilize many robotic processes to minimize the amount of labor used in the manufacturing process in 2005 we implemented our fourthgeneration oligator technology which is capable of manufacturing over 13000 different oligos per run this was an improvement over prior generations of technology where we could only manufacture approximately 3000 oligos per run this increase in scale was necessary to enable us to 

support the manufacture of oligos under our collaboration with invitrogen as well as to support our increased internal need for oligos a critical component of our beadarray technology for product sales and new product development 

 

key advantages of our technology 

 

we believe that our technology provides distinct advantages in a variety of applications over competing technologies by creating costeffective highly miniaturized arrays with the following characteristics 

 

high throughput the miniaturization of our beadarray technology provides very high information content per unit area to increase sample throughput we have formatted our array matrix in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates allowing throughput levels of up to nearly 150000 unique assays per microtiter plate and we use laboratory robotics to speed process time similarly we have patterned our wholegenome expression beadchips to support up to 48000 gene expression assays for six samples with each beadchip and our wholegenome genotyping beadchips to support over 1000000 genotypes with each beadchip our infinium and goldengate assays are supported by full automation and lims to address high throughput laboratories our genome analyzer can analyze the dna sequences of tens of millions of clusters at one time 

 

cost effectiveness our array products substantially reduce the cost of our customers’ experiments as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances in fiber optics plasma etching processes digital imaging and bead chemistry in addition our products require smaller reagent volumes than other array technologies thereby reducing reagent costs for our customers our oligator technology further reduces reagent costs as well as reducing our cost of coating beads used in our beadarray and veracode technologies we believe the genome analyzer allows dna sequencing at 1100th of the cost of conventional capillary instruments 

 

flexibility we are able to offer flexible solutions to our customers based on our ability to attach different kinds of molecules including dna rna proteins and other chemicals to our beads in addition we can have beadchips manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes with wells organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different markets and market segments in combination the use of beads and etched wells provides the flexibility and scalability for our beadarray technology to be tailored to perform many applications in many different market segments from drug discovery to diagnostics our oligator technology allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of oligos dna sequences determined with our genome analyzer can be used to identify larger dna or rna molecules from which the sequences have been derived and can also be used for a series of applications based on tag sequencing including digital gene expression analysis and microrna discovery and quantification 

 

quality and reproducibility the quality of our products is dependent upon each element in the system — the array the assay used to perform the experiment and the instrumentation and software used to capture the results each array is manufactured with a high density of beads which enables us to have multiple copies of each individual bead type we measure the copies simultaneously and combine them into one data point this allows us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population of identical beads which permits the statistical calculation of a more reliable and accurate value for each data point finally the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on every array improving the overall quality of the data when we develop the assays used with our products we focus on performance cost and ease of use by developing assays that are easy to use we can reduce the potential for the introduction of error into the experiment we believe that this enables researchers to obtain high quality and reproducible data from their experiments additionally we manufacture substantially all of the reagents used in our assays allowing us to control the quality of the product delivered to the customer 

our strategy 

 

our goal is to make our beadarray beadxpress and genome analyzer platforms the industry standard for products and services addressing the genetic analysis markets we plan to achieve this by 

 

  

products and services 

 

the first implementation of our beadarray technology the array matrix is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96well microtiter plate each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1500 unique assays the beadchip introduced in 2003 is fabricated in multiple configurations to support multiple applications and scanning technologies 

 

we have provided genotyping services using our proprietary beadarray technology since 2001 in addition we have developed our first genotyping and gene expression products based on this technology these products include disposable array matrices and beadchips goldengate and infinium reagent kits for snp genotyping beadarray reader scanning instruments and an evolving portfolio of custom and standard gene expression products 

 

snp genotyping 

 

in 2001 we introduced the first commercial application of our beadarray technology by launching our snp genotyping services product line since this launch we have had peak days in which we operated at 185 million genotypes per day to our knowledge no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low cost 

 

we designed our first consumable beadarray product the array matrix for snp genotyping the array matrix uses a universal format that allows it to analyze any set of snps we have also developed reagent kits based on goldengate assay protocols and the beadarray reader a laser scanner which is used to read our array products 

 

the beadstation a flexible and scalable system for performing genotyping was initially commercialized in late 2003 the system currently includes our beadarray reader and genotyping andor gene expression analysis software depending on throughput and automation requirements our customers can select the system configuration to best meet their needs for productionscale throughput multiple beadstations combined with lims standard operating procedures and analytical software and fluid handling robotics can be configured to produce millions of genotypes per day scientists and researchers can perform genotyping gene expression methylation and copy number variation cnv analysis with these products 

 

in 2006 we introduced several new snp genotyping products including the humanhap family of beadchips for genomewide disease association studies this family of beadchips enables researchers to interrogate more than 1000000 snp markers for associated studies we believe our beadchips provide the most comprehensive genomic coverage and highest data quality of any wholegenome genotyping product currently available through an application called copy number polymorphisms the humanhap family of beadchips also provides highresolution information on amplifications deletions and loss of heterozygosity throughout the genome abnormalities common in cancers and congenital diseases in addition we announced additional standard panels in the first quarter of 2006 including mouse linkage and cancer panels 

also in 2006 we began shipment of the iselect infinium genotyping product line used for focused content applications with this product customers can create a custom array of up to 60000 snp markers per sample with 12 samples per chip 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2006 we introduced and began shipping the humanhap300duo and the humanhap300duo genotyping beadchips as well as the ratref12 expression beadchip the humanhap300duo allows researchers to analyze two samples simultaneously with over 634000 total tag snps on a single beadchip the humanhap300duo allows for the addition of 60000 custom snp loci to the base product enabling researchers to enrich that product with snps of interest in any genomic region the ratref12 expression beadchip enables analysis of 12 samples in parallel on a single beadchip content for this beadchip is derived from the ncbi refseq database release 16 with over 22000 rat transcripts represented by allowing for multiple samples on the same beadchip we believe we have minimized chip to chip variability and enhanced data quality 

 

in 2007 we announced the following key new product developments associated with snp genotyping 

 

  

during 2008 we introduced two new products for dna analysis the infinium highdensity hd human1mduo two samples per chip and the human610quad four samples per chip featuring up to 23 million snps per beadchip the new infinium hd product line doubles sample throughput and reduces dna input requirements by as much as 70 percent the infinium hd products also offer what we believe is enhanced signal discrimination and a new snp calling algorithm first customer shipments of the human610quad and human1mduo beadchips are expected in the first and second quarter of 2008 respectively 

 

gene expression profiling 

 

with the addition of application specific accessory kits our productionscale beadstations are capable of performing a growing number of applications including gene expression profiling 

 

in 2003 we introduced our focused set gene expression products on both the array matrix and beadchip platforms our system includes a beadarray reader for imaging array matrices and beadchips a hybridization chamber and software for data extraction 

 

in 2005 we began shipment of the human6 and humanref8 expression beadchip products both products allow largescale expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip and are imaged using our beadarray reader the human6 beadchip is designed to analyze six discrete wholehumangenome samples on one chip interrogating in each sample approximately 48000 transcripts from the estimated 30000 genes in the human genome the humanref8 beadchip product analyzes eight samples in parallel against 24000 transcripts from the roughly 22000 genes represented in the consensus refseq database a wellcharacterized wholegenome subset used broadly in genetic analysis we believe these gene expression beadchips have dramatically reduced the cost of wholegenome 

expression analysis allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of largescale biological experimentation 

 

in 2006 we began shipment of the ratref12 which analyzes twelve samples in parallel against 22226 transcripts from the roughly 21910 genes represented in the refseq database release 16 

 

in 2007 we launched the next versions of the human and mouse arrays taking advantage of the updated content of the refseq and the unigene databases could provide we also expanded our product breadth and released our first microrna arrays for both human and mouse to keep up with the ever changing needs of the market we have invested in the future with new innovative technologies acquired from the solexa acquisition to provide our customers with what we believe is the broadest portfolio of gene expression technologies available we believe digital gene expression dge is a revolutionary approach to expression analysis driven by sequencing technology dge generates genomewide expression profiles through sequencing not hybridization we believe this unique method provides 100 times the amount of data of other methods it can provide more than one billion bases of data in a single run at 1 of the cost of traditional sanger sequencing using dge researchers can 

 

  

instrumentation 

 

the beadarray reader an instrument we developed is a key component of our beadstation this scanning equipment uses a laser to read the results of experiments that are captured on our arrays and was designed to be used in all areas of genetic analysis that use our array matrices and beadchips in the second quarter of 2006 we began shipment of the autoloader which automates beadchip loading and scanning and increases lab throughput the autoloader is designed to support up to two beadarray readers simultaneously for unattended operation 

 

during the first quarter of 2007 we began shipment of the genome analyzer this product can generate more than one billion bases of data in a single run using a massively parallel sequencing approach the system leverages solexa sequencingbysynthesis technology and novel reversible terminator chemistry optimized to achieve what we believe are unprecedented levels of cost effectiveness and throughput 

 

also during the first quarter of 2007 we began shipment of the beadxpress system this system is a highthroughput dualcolor laser detection system developed using the veracode digital microbead technology it enables scanning of a broad range of multiplexed assays and can take researchers from biomarker validation and focused studies to the development of molecular diagnostics 

 

highthroughput oligo synthesis 

 

we have put in place a stateoftheart oligo manufacturing facility this facility serves both the commercial needs under our collaboration with invitrogen and our internal needs in addition to their use to coat beads these oligos are components of the reagent kits for our beadarray products and are used for assay development we manufacture oligos in a wide range of lengths and in several scales with the ability to add many types of modifications we offer a range of quality control options and have implemented a laboratory information management system referred to as lims to control much of the manufacturing process in 2005 we stopped selling oligos directly into the market and began shipping oligos under our collaboration with invitrogen 

our collaborative partners 

 

decode genetics 

 

in may 2006 we executed a joint development and licensing agreement the development agreement with decode genetics ehf decode pursuant to the development agreement the parties agreed to collaborate exclusively to develop validate and commercialize specific diagnostic tests for variants in genes involved in three diseaserelated pathways the geneencoding leukotriene a4 hydrolase linked to heart attack the geneencoding transcription factor 7like 2 tcf7l2 linked to type 2 diabetes and the geneencoding bard1 linked to breast cancer with decode we are developing diagnostic tests based on these variants for use on our beadxpress system 

 

under the agreement we are responsible for the manufacturing marketing and selling of the diagnostic products the companies share the development costs of these products and split the profits from sales of the diagnostics tests the development agreement may be terminated as to a particular product under development if one party decides to discontinue funding the development of that product and may be terminated in whole by either party if the other party commits an uncured material breach files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent under a separate supply agreement we installed instrumentation at decode that enables decode to perform whole genome association studies on up to 100000 samples using our humanhap300 beadchips and associated reagents

although we expect that our products and services will provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the snp genotyping gene expression and sequencing markets these include companies such as affymetrix agilent applera corporation applied biosystems beckman coulter complete genomics fluidigm ge corp luminex pacific biosciences perlegen sciences roche diagnostics sequenom and third wave technologies some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we need to address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over the competing products rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies although we believe that our technology and products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful 

 

segment and geographic information 

 

we operate in one business segment for the development manufacture and commercialization of tools for genetic analysis our operations are treated as one segment as we only report operating results on an aggregate basis to our chief operating decision maker our chief executive officer 

 

during 2007 1591 million or 43 of our total revenue came from shipments to customers outside the united states compared to 815 million or 44 and 280 million or 38 in 2006 and 2005 respectively sales to territories outside of the united states are generally denominated in us dollars we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue we have sales support resources in western europe and direct sales offices in japan singapore and china in addition we have distributor relationships in various countries in the pacific rim region and europe see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations 

 

seasonality 

 

historically customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation although demand for our products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as academic customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the government’s fiscal year 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are dedicated to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials which subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

 

during 2007 we entered into a lease agreement with biomed realty trust inc to expand into a new office building in san diego california this new building will be leed certified 

employees 

 

as of december 30 2007 we had a total of 1041 employees 195 of whom hold phd degrees ninetyseven of our employees with phd degrees are engaged in fulltime research and development activities none of our employees are represented by a labor union we consider our employee relations to be positive

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

 

we expect intense competition in our target markets which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell this would limit our ability to compete and maintain profitability if we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products our revenue may not grow as intended 

 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using technologies such as twodimensional electrophoresis capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry flow cytometry microfluidics nanotechnology nextgeneration dna sequencing and mechanically deposited inkjet and photolithographic arrays we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards changes in customer needs emerging competition new product introductions and strong price competition for example prices per data point for genotyping have fallen significantly over the last two years and we anticipate that prices will continue to fall one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could develop competing products for example during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 applied biosystems group a business segment of applera corporation launched the solid tm system  its next generation sequencing technology if we are unable 

to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

 

our manufacturing capacity may limit our ability to sell our products 

 

we continue to ramp up our capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our business plan in 2008 and 2009 there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

 

we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth these difficulties could impair our profitability 

 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans which will place a strain on our human and capital resources if we are unable to manage this growth effectively our profitability could suffer our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 

 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

 

we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego and san francisco area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies 

 

our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies including the life sciences and healthcare industries thus we will need to add new personnel including management and develop the expertise of existing management the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 

if we are unable to develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

we currently manufacture in a limited number of locations our manufacturing facilities are located in san diego and hayward california and little chesterford united kingdom we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing operations into singapore a country in which we have no past manufacturing experience these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods if a natural disaster were to significantly damage one of our facilities or if other events were to cause our operations to fail these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services 

 

also many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally as part of the decoding step in our array manufacturing process we record several images of each array to identify what bead is in each location on the array and to validate each bead in the array this requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and would prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

 

our sales marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products 

 

we currently have fewer resources available for sales and marketing and technical support services compared to some of our primary competitors in order to effectively commercialize our sequencing genotyping and gene expression systems and other products to follow we will need to expand our sales marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services in addition we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place and the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business 

 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio 

 

our investment securities consist of us dollarbased short maturity mutual funds commercial paper corporate bonds treasury notes auction rate securities and municipal bonds as of december 30 2007 our shortterm investments included 147 million of highgrade aaa rated auction rate securities issued primarily by municipalities and universities the recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings including their holdings of auction rate securities in february 2008 we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for four of our highgrade auction rate securities representing approximately 107 million as a result these affected securities are currently not liquid and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the issuer or to maturity we may experience a similar situation with our remaining auction rate securities in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal until a future auction on these investments is successful the securities are redeemed by the issuer or they mature at this time management has not obtained sufficient evidence to conclude that these investments are impaired or that they will not be settled in the short term although the market for these investments is presently uncertain if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be otherthantemporary we would adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 

we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions that could adversely affect our business specifically the effective launch and customer acceptance of new technology platforms 

 

we acquired solexa in january 2007 and cyvera in april 2005 and we may in the future acquire technology products or businesses related to our current or future business we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions further these potential acquisitions entail risks uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business for example we may not be able to successfully integrate a company’s operations technologies products and services information systems and personnel into our business an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial resources and divert management’s attention away from our other business concerns 

 

in connection with these acquisitions we assumed certain liabilities and hired certain employees which is expected to continue to result in an increase in our research and development expenses and capital expenditures there may also be unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with an acquisition that could adversely affect our operating results to finance any acquisitions we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration which could result in dilution to our stockholders additionally an acquisition may have a substantial negative impact on nearterm expected financial results 

 

the success of the solexa acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies growth opportunities and cost savings from integrating solexa’s businesses with our businesses our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends upon the continued successful integration of the operations of solexa the integration of two independent companies is a complex costly and timeconsuming process in addition solexa continues to operate at separate sites geographic integration in whole or in part could result in the loss of key employees diversion of each company’s management’s attention the disruption or interruption of or the loss of momentum in each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company 

 

the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as a result of our failure to achieve anticipated revenue growth following the acquisition 

 

for various reasons including significant competition low market acceptance or market growth and lack of technology advantage revenue recognized from the solexa acquisition may not grow as anticipated and if so we may not realize the expected value from this transaction 

 

if we are unable to find thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture components of our products we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources for example we currently use multiple components in our products that are singlesourced if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components we will be unable to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 

 

changes in our effective income tax rate could impact our profitability 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in 

determining the provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in existing tax laws or tax rates changes in the level of nondeductible expenses including sharebased compensation changes in our future levels of research and development spending mergers and acquisitions and the result of examinations by various tax authorities 

 

any inability to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position 

 

our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in protecting their proprietary rights abroad these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights abroad 

 

the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries including our patent position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued questions as to inventorship may also arise any finding that our patents and applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies also our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 

 

we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information we have taken security measures to protect our confidential information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information among other things we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants nevertheless employees collaborators or consultants may still disclose our confidential information and we may not otherwise be able to effectively protect our trade secrets accordingly others may gain access to our confidential information or may independently develop substantially equivalent information or techniques 

 

litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services or impact our stock price 

 

our commercial success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and on our ability to protect our own intellectual property third parties have asserted or may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we 

enter new markets we expect that competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have a material adverse impact on our stock price which may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize and sell products and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products in addition we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and maintain profitability 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness we may not be able to make payments on our indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our operation and profitability 

 

in february 2007 we issued 400 million of 0625 convertible senior notes due february 2014 the notes bear interest semiannually mature on february 15 2014 and obligate us to repurchase the notes at the option of the holders if a “designated event” as defined in the indenture for the notes such as certain merger transactions involving us occurs in addition upon conversion of the notes we must pay in cash the principal portion of the notes being converted our ability to make payments on the notes will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to generate cash and may also depend on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing we may need to use our cash to pay principal and interest on our debt which will reduce the funds available to fund our research and development programs strategic initiatives and working capital requirements our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to service the notes and fund our operating requirements will depend on our continued ability to commercialize new products and expand our manufacturing capabilities our debt service obligations increase our vulnerabilities to competitive pressures because our competitors may be less leveraged than we are if we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow to service our indebtedness and fund our operating requirements we may be forced to reduce our development programs or seek additional debt or equity financing which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all or may dilute the interests of our existing stockholders our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns if we incur new indebtedness the risks relating to our business and our ability to service our indebtedness will intensify 

 

we expect that our results of operations will fluctuate this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 

 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars accordingly if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual profitability any significant 

delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

 

we have only recently achieved annual operating profitability 

 

prior to 2006 we had incurred net losses each year since our inception and in 2007 we reported a net loss of 2784 million reflecting significant charges associated with our acquisition of solexa in january 2007 and the settlement of our litigation with affymetrix as of december 30 2007 our accumulated deficit was 3830 million our ability to regain and sustain annual profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses noncash stockbased compensation expense and expenses related to our acquisition of solexa are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability we expect to continue incurring significant expenses related to research and development sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products and the continued development of our manufacturing capabilities in addition we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products even if we regain profitability we may not be able to increase profitability on a quarterly basis 

 

a significant portion of our sales are to international customers 

 

approximately 43 44 and 38 of our revenue for the years ended december 30 2007 december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 respectively was derived from shipments to customers outside the united states we intend to continue to expand our international presence and export sales to international customers and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow export sales entail a variety of risks including 

 

  

in addition sales to international customers typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection we are also subject to general geopolitical risks such as political social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function namely sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and biological function in 

addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to sustain annual profitability 

 

the accounting method for our convertible debt securities may be subject to change 

 

a convertible debt security providing for share andor cash settlement of the conversion value and meeting specified requirements under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0019 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company’s own stock  including our outstanding convertible debt securities is currently classified in its entirety as debt under us generally accepted accounting principles no portion of the carrying value of such a security related to the conversion option indexed to the issuer’s stock is classified as equity in addition interest expense is recognized at the stated coupon rate the coupon rate of interest for convertible debt securities including our convertible debt securities is typically lower than an issuer would be required to pay for nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms 

 

the eitf recently considered whether the accounting for cash settled convertible debt securities which are convertible debt securities that require or permit settlement in cash either in whole or in part upon conversion should be changed but was unable to reach a consensus and discontinued deliberations on this issue subsequently in july 2007 the financial accounting standards board fasb voted unanimously to reconsider the current accounting for cash settled convertible debt securities which includes our convertible debt securities in august 2007 the fasb exposed for public comment a proposed fasb staff position fsp that would change the method of accounting for such securities and would require the proposed method to be retrospectively applied the fasb began its redeliberations of the guidance in that proposed fsp in january 2008 the fsp if issued as proposed would likely become effective for companies like us in the first quarter of 2009 under this proposed method of accounting the debt and equity components of our convertible debt securities would be bifurcated and accounted for separately in a manner that would result in recognizing interest on these securities at effective rates more comparable to what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms the equity component of our convertible debt securities would be included in the paidincapital section of stockholders’ equity on our balance sheet and accordingly the initial carrying values of these debt securities would be reduced our net income for financial reporting purposes would be reduced by recognizing the accretion of the reduced carrying values of our convertible debt securities to their face amounts as additional noncash interest expense therefore if the proposed method of accounting for cash settled convertible debt securities is adopted by the fasb as described above it would have an adverse impact on our past and future reported financial results as the final guidance has not been issued we cannot predict its ultimate outcome 

 

we also cannot predict any other changes in gaap that may be made affecting accounting for convertible debt securities some of which could have an adverse impact on our past or future reported financial results

affymetrix litigation 

 

on january 9 2008 we resolved all our outstanding litigations with affymetrix inc affymetrix by entering into a settlement agreement in which we agreed without admitting liability to make a onetime payment to affymetrix of 900 million in return affymetrix agreed to dismiss with prejudice all lawsuits it had brought against us and we agreed to dismiss with prejudice our counterclaims in the relevant lawsuits in exchange for the payment affymetrix agreed not to sue us or our affiliates or customers for making using or selling any of our current products evolutions of those products or services related to 

those products in addition affymetrix agreed that for four years it will not sue us for making using or selling our products or services that are based on future technology developments the covenant not to sue covers all fields other than photolithography the process by which affymetrix manufactures its arrays and a field in which we do not operate 

 

the january 2008 settlement resolved complaints affymetrix had previously filed in the us and abroad specifically on july 26 2004 affymetrix had filed a complaint in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging that the use manufacture and sale of our beadarray products and services including our array matrix and beadchip products infringe six affymetrix patents at that time affymetrix was also seeking an injunction against the sale of any products that would ultimately be determined to infringe these patents unspecified monetary damages interest and attorneys’ fees subsequently on october 24 2007 affymetrix had filed complaints in the us district court for the district of delaware in regional court in düsseldorf germany and in the high court of justice chancery division — patents court in london united kingdom alleging that the use manufacture and sale of certain of our beadarray products and services including our array matrix and beadchip products infringe three us patents and three european patents of affymetrix in its us complaint filed in 2007 affymetrix had also alleged that our sequencing technology including the genome analyzer infringes two affymetrix us patents affymetrix also sought an injunction against the sale of any products that would ultimately be determined to infringe these patents unspecified monetary damages interest and attorneys’ fees 

 

former employee claim 

 

on june 15 2005 a former employee filed suit against us in the us district court for the district of delaware seeking an order requiring us and the us patent and trademark office to correct the inventorship of certain of our patents and patent applications by adding the former employee as an inventor alleging that we committed inequitable conduct and fraud in not naming him as an inventor and seeking a judgment declaring certain of our patents and patent applications unenforceable unspecified monetary damages and attorney’s fees on january 30 2008 this dispute was resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties by entering into a release and settlement agreement pursuant to which all claims pending in that litigation were dismissed with prejudice 

 

applied biosystems litigation 

 

on december 26 2006 the applied biosystems group of applera corporation applied biosystems filed suit in california superior court santa clara county against solexa which we acquired on january 26 2007 this state court action is about the ownership of several patents assigned in 1995 to solexa’s predecessor company lynx therapeutics by a former employee dr stephen macevicz who is the inventor of these patents and is named as a codefendant in the suit lynx was originally a unit of applied biosystems but was spun out in 1992 on may 31 2007 applied biosystems filed a second suit this time against us in the us district court for the northern district of california this second suit seeks a declaratory judgment of noninfringement of the macevicz patents that are the subject of the state court action mentioned above both suits were later consolidated in the us district court for the northern district of california san francisco division 

 

the macevicz patents relate to methods for sequencing dna using successive rounds of oligonucleotide probe ligation sequencingbyligation our genome analyzer system uses a different technology called dna sequencingbysynthesis sbs which is not covered by any of these patents in addition the sequencing technology originally used by lynx therapeutics called “mpss tm ” is not based on the methods covered by the macevicz patents in any event we have never used mpss tm in our sequencing platform furthermore we have no plans to use any of the sequencingbyligation technologies covered by these patents by these consolidated actions applied biosytems is seeking ownership of the macevicz patents unspecified costs and damages and a declaration of noninfringement of these patents applied biosystems is not asserting any claim for patent infringement against us

the following discussion and analysis should be read with “item 6 selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the discussion and analysis in this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans objectives expectations and intentions words such as “anticipate” “believe” “continue” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “may” “plan” “potential” “predict” “project” or similar words or phrases or the negatives of these words may identify forwardlooking statements but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking examples of forwardlooking statements include among others statements regarding the integration of solexa’s and cyvera’s technology with our existing technology the commercial launch of new products including products based on solexa’s and cyvera’s technology and the duration which our existing cash and other resources is expected to fund our operating activities 

 

forwardlooking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in “item 1a risk factors” as well as those discussed elsewhere the risk factors and other cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as applying to all related forwardlooking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form 10k 

 

overview 

 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function using our proprietary technologies we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing genotyping and gene expression markets in the future we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics our customers include leading genomic research centers pharmaceutical companies academic institutions clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 

 

in april 2005 we completed the acquisition of cyvera the aggregate consideration for the transaction was 145 million consisting of approximately 15 million shares of our common stock and payment of approximately 23 million of cyvera’s liabilities at the closing 

 

on january 26 2007 we completed the acquisition of solexa for approximately 131 million shares of our common stock solexa develops and commercializes genetic analysis technologies used to perform a range of analyses including whole genome resequencing gene expressing analysis and small rna analysis we believe our combined company is the only company with genomescale technology for genotyping gene expression and sequencing the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 

 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and service projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 

as of december 30 2007 our accumulated deficit was 3830 million and total stockholders’ equity was 4117 million our losses have principally occurred as a result of acquired inprocess research and development charges of 3034 million related to our acquisition of solexa in 2007 the substantial resources required for the research development and manufacturing scaleup effort required to commercialize our products and services a charge of 545 million in 2007 primarily related to settlement of our litigation with affymetrix and 158 million related to our acquisition of cyvera in 2005 we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research development and manufacturing scaleup activities over the next several years we will also need to increase our selling general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems other products and services 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates assumptions and judgments with respect to the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates 

 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements certain accounting policies are deemed critical if 1 they require an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur or different estimates that we reasonably could have used would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue consists of sales of arrays reagents flow cells instrumentation and oligos service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services extended warranty sales and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 

 

we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 104 under sab no 104 revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured all revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 

 

revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of instrumentation is recognized when earned which is generally upon shipment revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping and sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable we ensure there are no refund rights if payment terms are based on future performance or a right of return exists we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment changes in judgments and estimates regarding application of sab no 104 might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized 

 

sales of instrumentation generally include a standard oneyear warranty we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts which are generally for one or two years upon the expiration of the initial warranty revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates gross margins could be adversely affected 

 

while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions emerging issues task force eitf no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine that the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances could be required 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supercede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycle and development plans product expiration and quality issues historical experience and our current inventory levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

 

contingencies 

 

we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses if losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

 

our goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from our solexa and cyvera acquisitions our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired technology and customer relationships from the acquisition of solexa and licensed technology from the affymetrix settlement we make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from i acquisitions and ii litigation settlements 

 

in determining the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets arising from acquisitions we used the purchase method of accounting the purchase method of accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to at least annual impairment tests the amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization and the amount assigned to iprd is expensed immediately 

 

determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets acquired as part of litigation settlements also requires the exercise of judgment while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets we used the discounted cash flow method in determining the value of licensed technology associated with the settlement of our affymetrix litigation this method required significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis in addition other significant estimates were required such as residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we used to value and amortize intangible assets were consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results in addition we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect a change in revenue projections of 10 would have on our intangible asset noting the impact would be a reduction or increase in the value of the intangible asset of 20 million 

 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projection and timing of future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows perpetual growth rates determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect if our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets we could incur additional impairment charges we have performed our annual test of goodwill as of may 1 2007 noting no impairment and have determined there has been no impairment of goodwill through december 30 2007 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r sharebased payment under the provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fairvalue as calculated by the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility forfeiture rates and expected option life if any of 

these assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

 

income taxes 

 

in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence as of december 30 2007 we have maintained a valuation allowance only against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the “more likely than not” threshold required under sfas no 109 

 

due to the adoption of sfas no 123r we recognize excess tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to sharebased compensation have been realized we follow the withandwithout approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions under this approach excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 

 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions fin no 48 requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 

results of operations 

 

to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 30 2007 december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 stated as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

 

comparison of years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 

 

our fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 were both 52 weeks 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

total revenue for the years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 was 3668 million and 1846 million respectively this represents an increase of 1822 million for 2007 or 99 compared to 2006 

 

product revenue increased to 3267 million for the year ended december 30 2007 from 1558 million for the year ended december 31 2006 consumable products and instruments 

constituted 59 and 37 of product revenue for the year ended december 30 2007 respectively compared to 64 and 28 for the year ended december 31 2006 respectively the change in sales associated with our product mix is due to increased sales in instruments primarily attributable to the genome analyzer which was introduced during the first quarter of 2007 growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our infinium products we expect to see continued growth in product revenue which can be mainly attributed to the launch of several new products sales of existing products and the growth of our installed base of instruments 

 

service and other revenue increased to 401 million for the year ended december 30 2007 from 288 million for the year ended december 31 2006 service and other revenue includes revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing service contracts and extended warranty contracts in 2007 service and other revenue also includes research revenue historically research revenue was included in a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to the completion of several significant infinium and iselect custom snp genotyping service contracts and sequencing services contracts we expect sales from snp genotyping and sequencing services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed the timing of completion of snp genotyping and sequencing services contracts are highly dependent on the customers’ schedules for delivering the snps and samples to us 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue 

 

 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead installation warranty packaging and delivery costs as well as costs associated with performing genotyping and sequencing services on behalf of our customers cost of product revenue increased to 1200 million for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 513 million for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily driven by higher consumable and instrument sales cost of product revenue for the years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 included noncash stockbased compensation expense of 40 million and 13 million respectively gross margin on product revenue decreased to 633 for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 671 for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in the gross margin percentage is primarily due to the shift in product mix towards instruments in addition the gross margin percentage was adversely impacted by the increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense as well as 07 million associated with the amortization of inventory revaluation costs related to our acquisition of solexa in january 2007 the impact of noncash stockbased compensation charges decreased our gross margin by 41 basis points for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the inventory revaluation costs decreased our gross margin by 24 basis points for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 

 

cost of service and other revenue increased to 124 million for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 81 million for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to higher service revenue gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to 690 for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 719 for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in the gross margin percentage is primarily driven by unfavorable product mix 

we expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross margins we expect price competition to continue in our market and our margins may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter as a result 

 

research and development expenses 

 

 

 

our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design development testing and enhancement of our products we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 

 

research and development expenses increased to 739 million for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 334 million for the year ended december 31 2006 research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 202 for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 181 for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 270 million of the increase for the year ended december 30 2007 was due to higher research and development expenses associated with our acquisition of solexa in january 2007 costs to support our beadarray technology research activities increased approximately 85 million for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to an overall increase in personnelrelated expenses and increased lab and material expenses several new infinium chip products including the human 1m dna analysis beadchip humancnv370duo beadchip and humanhap550duo beadchip have been introduced to the market in 2007 in addition noncash stockbased compensation expense increased approximately 61 million compared to the year ended december 31 2006 these increases were partially offset by a 10 million decrease in research and development expenses related to the veracode technology compared to the year ended december 31 2006 we began shipping our beadxpress system which is based on our veracode technology during the first quarter of 2007 as a result of completing the development of this product the related research and development expenses have decreased 

 

we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets accordingly we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing finance human resources business development legal and general management as well as professional fees such as expenses for legal and accounting services selling general and administrative expenses increased to 1013 million for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 541 million for the year december 31 2006 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased 245 million during the year ended december 30 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase is primarily due to increases of 186 million attributable to personnelrelated expenses to support the growth of our business 33 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense and 26 million attributable to other nonpersonnelrelated expenses consisting mainly of sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products general and administrative expense increased 227 million during the year ended 

december 30 2007 compared to the year ended december 30 2006 due to increases of 87 million in personnelrelated expenses associated with the growth of our business 72 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense 34 million in outside legal fees 33 million in other outside service expenses primarily due to increases in consulting fees and increased tax audit and other public company costs 

 

we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the growth in our business 

 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

 

 

 

amortization of acquired intangible assets totaled 24 million for the year ended december 30 2007 there was no amortization of acquired intangibles for the year ended december 31 2006 the amount amortized in 2007 represents the amortization of our intangible assets acquired from solexa in january 2007 

 

acquired inprocess research and development 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 30 2007 we recorded 3034 million of acquired iprd resulting from the solexa acquisition at the acquisition date solexa’s ongoing research and development initiatives were primarily involved with the development of its genetic analysis platform for sequencing and expression profiling these inprocess research and development projects are comprised of solexa’s reversible terminating nucleotide biochemistry platform referred to as sequencingbysynthesis sbs biochemistry as well as solexa’s reagent analyzer and sequencing services related technologies which were valued at 2372 million 442 million 191 million and 29 million respectively at the acquisition date although these projects were approximately 95 complete at the acquisition date they had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use accordingly the amounts allocated to those projects were written off in the first quarter of 2007 the period the acquisition was consummated acquisitions of businesses products or technologies by us in the future may result in substantial charges for acquired iprd that may cause fluctuations in our interim or annual operating results there were no charges resulting from any acquisitions during the same period in fiscal 2006 

 

litigation settlements 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 30 2007 we recorded a charge of 545 million associated with two settlement agreements entered into subsequent to yearend the total charge is comprised primarily of 540 million related to a 900 million settlement with affymetrix entered into on january 9 2008 for certain patent litigation between the parties see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this settlement 

interest income 

 

 

 

interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 160 million and 54 million for the years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the increase in interest income over the prior year was primarily driven by higher cash balances from the proceeds of our february 2007 convertible debt offering cash acquired as part of the solexa acquisition and improved operating cash flow in addition we experienced higher effective interest rates on our cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

interest and other expense net 

 

 

 

interest and other expense net consists of interest expense and other income and expenses related to net foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses interest and other expense net increased to 36 million for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 06 million for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

interest expense was 36 million for the year ended december 30 2007 compared to 11000 for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase is primarily related to our convertible debt offering in february 2007 for the years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 we recorded approximately 05 million and 04 million respectively in net foreign currency transaction losses respectively in 2007 these foreign currency exchange losses were offset by 05 million of foreign currency exchange gains associated with the sale of our secured convertible debentures with genizon biosciences inc genizon in the fourth quarter of 2007 see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sale of our debentures with genizon 

 

provision benefit for income taxes 

 

 

 

the provision benefit for income taxes was approximately 104 million and 27 million for the years ended december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the provision consists of federal state and foreign income tax expense offset in 2007 by the release of the valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets 

 

during the year ended december 30 2007 we utilized approximately 729 million and 108 million of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards respectively to reduce our federal and state income taxes as of december 30 2007 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately 287 million and 991 million respectively which begin to expire in 2025 and 2015 respectively unless previously utilized in addition we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 92 million and 93 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019 respectively unless previously utilized 

 

pursuant to section 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our 

ownership structure these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization previous limitations due to section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of december 30 2007 

 

as of december 30 2007 we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized and accordingly we released a portion of our valuation allowance approximately 171 million of which was recorded as a reduction to the tax provision in addition we established current and long term deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheets of approximately 268 million and 801 million respectively and decreased the goodwill balances recorded in conjunction with the cyvera and solexa acquisitions by approximately 21 million and 184 million respectively based upon the available evidence as of december 30 2007 we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately 29 million and 254 million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets respectively 

 

comparison of years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 

 

our fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 were both 52 weeks 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

total revenue for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 was 1846 million and 735 million respectively this represents an increase of 1111 million for 2006 or 151 compared to 2005 

 

product revenue increased to 1558 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 578 million for the year ended january 1 2006 the increase in 2006 resulted primarily from higher consumable and beadstation sales growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to the launch and shipment of our whole genome genotyping products the humanhap300 and humanhap550 beadchips in addition growth in consumable revenue can be attributed to the growth in our installed base of beadarray readers which has nearly doubled since january 1 2006 consumable products constituted 66 of product revenue for year ended december 31 2006 compared to 47 in the year ended january 1 2006 we expect to see continued growth in product revenue which can be partially attributed to the launch of several new products as well as the growth of our installed base of instruments 

 

service and other revenue increased to 288 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 157 million for the year ended january 1 2006 the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to the completion of several significant infinium and goldengate snp genotyping service contracts we introduced our infinium services in early 2006 we expect sales from snp genotyping services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed the timing of completion of a snp genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the customer’s schedule for delivering the snps and samples to us this increase in service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in government grants and other research funding of 05 million over the prior year due primarily to the completion of several projects funded by grants from the national 

institutes of health we do not expect research revenue to be a material component of our revenue going forward 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue 

 

 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead installation warranty packaging and delivery costs as well as costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf of our customers costs related to research revenue are included in research and development expense cost of product revenue increased to 513 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 199 million for the year ended january 1 2006 primarily driven by higher consumable and instrument sales cost of product revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 included stockbased compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r totaling 13 million gross margin on product revenue increased to 671 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 655 for the year ended january 1 2006 the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the impact of favorable product mix as well as decreased manufacturing costs a higher percentage of our revenue in 2006 was generated from the sale of consumables which generally have a more favorable gross margin than other products the decrease in manufacturing costs is primarily due to reduced raw material costs as a result of more favorable negotiated contracts with our vendors and improvements in our manufacturing processes this increase in gross margin was offset in part by the impact of stockbased compensation charges which decreased our gross margin by 83 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

cost of service and other revenue increased to 81 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 33 million for the year ended january 1 2006 primarily due to higher service revenue cost of service and other revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 included stockbased compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r totaling 02 million gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to 719 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 793 for the year ended january 1 2006 the decrease is due primarily to a change in the mix of projects as well as the impact of stockbased compensation charges the latter having decreased our service and other revenue gross margin by 85 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

we expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross margins however we expect our market to become increasingly price competitive and our margins may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 

 

research and development expenses 

 

 

 

our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design development testing and enhancement of our products we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 

research and development expenses increased to 334 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 278 million for the year ended january 1 2006 research and development expenses for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 included stockbased compensation expenses primarily resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r totaling 39 million and 01 million respectively exclusive of these stockbased compensation charges the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 is primarily due to the development of our recentlyacquired veracode technology purchased in conjunction with our acquisition of cyvera in april 2005 we launched the first products resulting from this acquisition during the first quarter of 2007 research and development expenses related to the veracode technology increased 27 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended january 1 2006 in addition costs to support our oligator technology platform and beadarray research activities decreased 10 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended january 1 2006 

 

we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets accordingly we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base and integrate the operations of solexa into our business 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing finance human resources business development legal and general management as well as professional fees such as expenses for legal and accounting services selling general and administrative expenses increased to 541 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 282 million for the year ended january 1 2006 selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 included stockbased compensation expenses primarily resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r totaling 89 million and 02 million respectively 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased 106 million during the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended january 1 2006 the increase is primarily due to increases of 65 million attributable to personnelrelated expenses 32 million of stockbased compensation expense and 09 million attributable to other nonpersonnelrelated costs mainly sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products general and administrative expenses increased 153 million during the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended january 1 2006 due to increases of 55 million of stockbased compensation expense 53 million in outside legal costs related to the affymetrix litigation 31 million in personnelrelated expenses associated with the growth of our business and 14 million in outside consulting costs outside consulting costs primarily include tax and audit fees and general legal expenses not associated with the affymetrix litigation 

 

we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff add sales and marketing infrastructure incur increased litigation costs and incur additional costs to support the growth in our business 

 

interest income 

 

 

interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 54 million and 14 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 respectively the increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher effective interest rates compared to the prior year 

 

interest and other expense net 

 

 

 

interest and other expense net consists of interest expense other income and expenses related to foreign exchange transaction costs and gains and losses on disposals of assets interest and other expense net decreased to 06 million for the year ended january 1 2006 compared to 07 million for the year ended january 2 2005 

 

interest expense was 11000 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 7000 for the year ended january 1 2006 for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 we recorded approximately 04 million in losses due to foreign currency transactions in addition in 2006 we recorded 01 million related to losses on disposal of assets compared to 03 million of losses in 2005 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

the provision for income taxes was approximately 27 million in 2006 up from 02 million in 2005 in 2006 the provision principally consists of federal and state alternative minimum tax and income tax expense related to foreign operations in 2005 the provision for income taxes consisted of income tax expense related to foreign operations 

 

during the year ended december 31 2006 we utilized approximately 259 million and 166 million of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards respectively to reduce our federal and state income taxes as of december 31 2006 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately 764 million and 391 million respectively which begin to expire in 2022 and 2013 respectively unless previously utilized in addition we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 64 million and 63 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019 respectively unless previously utilized 

 

pursuant to section 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization previous limitations due to section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of december 31 2006 

 

based upon the available evidence as of december 31 2006 we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not the remaining deferred tax assets in the us will be realized therefore we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the us deferred tax assets of approximately 365 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cashflow 

 

 

 

historically our sources of cash have included 

 

  

our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with 

 

  

other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include 

 

  

as of december 30 2007 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 3861 million compared to 1308 million as of december 31 2006 we currently invest our funds in us dollarbased short maturity mutual funds commercial paper corporate bonds treasury notes auction rate securities and municipal bonds we do not hold securities backed by mortgages as of december 30 2007 our shortterm investments included 147 million of highgrade aaa rated auction rate securities issued primarily by municipalities and universities see part i item 1a “risk factors — negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio” 

 

the primary inflows of cash during the year ended december 30 2007 were approximately 3903 million from the net proceeds of our convertible debt offering in february 2007 4794 million from the sale and maturity of our investments in availableforsale securities and 924 million generated from the sale of warrants in february 2007 in addition on january 26 2007 we completed the merger 

with solexa which resulted in net cash acquired of 721 million the primary cash outflows during the year ended december 30 2007 were attributable to the purchase of availableforsale securities for approximately 5984 million the repurchase of an aggregate of 74 million shares of our common stock for approximately 2516 million as well as approximately 1390 million for the purchase of a convertible note hedge these convertible note transactions and our stock repurchase program are discussed in detail below 

 

on february 16 2007 we issued 4000 million principal amount of 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 the notes the net proceeds from the offering after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses were approximately 3903 million we used approximately 2016 million of the net proceeds to purchase approximately 58 million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering we used 466 million of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the net cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which are designed to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes we are using the balance of the net proceeds for other general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions and additional repurchases of our common stock the notes mature on february 15 2014 and bear interest semiannually at a rate of 0625 per year payable on february 15 and august 15 of each year beginning on august 15 2007 in addition we may in certain circumstances be obligated to pay additional interest if a “designated event” as defined in the indenture for the notes occurs holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition upon conversion of the notes we must pay the principal portion in cash the notes will become convertible only in certain circumstances based on conditions relating to the trading price of the notes and our common stock or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events and we expect the notes to become convertible beginning in the second quarter of 2008 if the trading price of our common stock does not decline from current levels the notes also will by their terms become convertible at any time from and including november 15 2013 through the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding february 15 2014 

 

on february 20 2007 we executed a rule 10b51 trading plan to repurchase up to 750 million of our outstanding common stock over a period of six months we repurchased approximately 16 million shares of our common stock under this plan for approximately 500 million in cash as of december 30 2007 this plan had expired 

 

our primary shortterm needs for capital which are subject to change include expenditures related to 

 

  

approximately 243 million of our net cash generated from operations for the year ended december 30 2007 was used on capital expenditures primarily for manufacturing and research and development equipment furniture fixtures and computer equipment we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income as well as the status of each of our new product development programs will significantly impact our cash management decisions 

we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next 12 months operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures at the present time we have no material commitments for capital expenditures due to expansion of our facilities and manufacturing operations we anticipate spending approximately 250 million in capital expenditures during 2008 our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including 

 

  

as a result of the factors listed above we may require additional funding in the future our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes during the fiscal year ended december 30 2007 we were not involved in any “off balance sheet arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the securities and exchange commission 

 

contractual obligations 

 

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding and contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment additionally the table excludes uncertain tax positions of 214 million the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on changes to agreedupon terms or amounts for some obligations

interest rate sensitivity 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 

 

market price sensitive instruments 

 

in order to reduce the potential equity dilution we entered into a convertible note hedge contract entitling us to purchase a maximum of 11451480 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment at an initial strike price of 4366 per share subject to adjustment upon conversion of our convertible senior notes this hedge contract is expected to reduce the equity dilution if the daily volumeweighted average price per share of our commons stock exceeds the strike price of the hedge we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties of the convertible note hedge transactions entitling them to acquire a maximum of 18322320 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment at an initial strike price of 6287 per share subject to adjustment the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during the measurement period at maturity of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants we did not hold any material derivative financial instruments for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

although most of our revenue is realized in us dollars some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local currencies accordingly the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

every person inherits two copies of each gene one from each parent the two copies of each gene may be identical or they may be different these differences are referred to as genetic variation examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color genetic variation can also have important medical consequences genetic variation affects disease susceptibility including predisposition to cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease in addition genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug treatment some people may respond well others may not respond at all and still others may experience adverse side effects a common form of genetic variation is a singlenucleotide polymorphism or snp a snp is a variation in a single position in a dna sequence it is estimated that the human genome contains over nine million snps 

 

while in some cases a single snp will be responsible for medically important effects it is now believed that combinations of snps may contribute to the development of most major diseases since there are millions of snps it is important to investigate many representative wellchosen snps simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable information 

 

another contributor to disease and dysfunction is the over or underexpression of genes within an organism’s cells a very complex network of genes interacts to maintain health in complex organisms the challenge for scientists is to delineate the associated genes’ expression patterns and their relationship to disease until recently this problem was addressed by investigating effects on a genebygene basis this is time consuming and difficulties exist when several pathways cannot be observed or “controlled” at the same time with the advent of microarray technology thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time 

 

snp genotyping 

 

snp genotyping is the process of determining which base a c g or t is present at a particular site in the genome within an individual or other organism the use of snp genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual snp or a collection of snps and to apply that information to clinical trials and diagnostic testing requires the analysis of millions of snp genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease for example a single large clinical trial could involve genotyping 300000 snps per patient in 1000 patients thus requiring 300 million assays using previously available technologies this scale of snp genotyping was both impractical and prohibitively expensive 

 

largescale snp genotyping can be used in a variety of ways including studies designed to understand the genetic contributions to disease disease association studies genomicsbased drug development clinical trial analysis disease predisposition testing and disease diagnosis snp genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare for example in the development of plants and animals with desirable commercial characteristics these markets will require billions of snp genotyping assays annually 

 

gene expression profiling 

 

gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mrna the intermediary messenger between genes dna and proteins variation in gene expression can cause disease or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease by comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different environments such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified studies of this type often used in drug discovery require monitoring thousands and preferably tens of thousands of mrnas in large numbers of samples once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples for example within a clinical trial 

 

as gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more costeffective technologies 

 

sequencing 

 

dna sequencing is the process of determining the order of bases a c g or t in a dna sample which can be further divided into de novo sequencing resequencing and tag sequencing in de novo sequencing the goal is to determine the sequence of a representative individual from a species never before sequenced understanding the similarities and differences in dna sequence between many species can help to improve our understanding of the function of the structures found in the dna 

 

in resequencing one determines the sequences of many individuals from the same species generally comparing each to a standard or reference sequence this is an extremely comprehensive form of genotyping in which every single base is characterized for possible mutations mutations tend to fall in two categories those which occur fairly frequently at a tiny fraction of bases eg at about 01 of bases in humans and those which occur much less frequently but at a large number of locations both types can contribute to diseases genotyping can subsequently be used to characterize the former but resequencing is used to assay the latter with the merger of illumina and solexa we will have stateoftheart technologies for both 

 

in tag sequencing short sequences each representative of a larger molecule or genomic location are detected and counted in these applications the number of times that each tag is seen provides quantification of an underlying biological process as an example in digital gene expression one tag sequence may exist for each gene and the number of copies of this tag which are detected in an experiment is a measure of how actively that gene is being expressed in the tissue sample being analyzed 

 

our technologies 

 

beadarray technology 

 

we have developed a proprietary array technology that enables the largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously our beadarray technology provides a unique combination of high throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility we achieve high throughput with a high density of test sites per array and we are able to format arrays either in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various configurations in the format of standard microscope slides we seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools or sensors for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments we believe that these features have enabled our beadarray technology to become a leading platform for the emerging highgrowth market of snp genotyping and expect they will enable us to become a key player in the gene expression market 

 

our proprietary beadarray technology combines microwells etched into a substrate and specially prepared beads that selfassemble into an array we have deployed our beadarray technology in two different array formats the array matrix and the beadchip our first beadbased product was the array matrix which incorporates fiber optic bundles the fiber optic bundles which we cut into lengths of less than one inch are manufactured to our specifications each bundle is comprised of approximately 50000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an aluminum plate which forms an array matrix beadchips are fabricated in microscope slideshaped sizes with varying numbers of sample sites per slide both formats are chemically etched to create tens to hundreds of thousands of wells for each sample site 

 

in a separate process we create sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make different batches of beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor for example we create a batch of snp sensors by attaching a particular dna sequence or oligo to each bead in the batch we combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to create a bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce thousands of arrays 

 

to form an array a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells one bead per well the tens of thousands of beads in the wells comprise our individual arrays because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called ’decoding’ in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we employ several proprietary methods for decoding a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each bead type multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads we believe we are the only microarray company to provide this level of quality control in the industry 

 

an experiment is performed by preparing a sample such as dna from a patient and introducing it to the array the design features of our array matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution containing the sample whereas our beadchip allows processing of samples on a slidesized platform the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated bead these molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with a fluorescent dye either before or after the binding the beadarray reader detects the fluorescent dye by shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the beadchip this allows the detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

 

veracode technology 

 

the beadarray technology is most effective in applications which require mid to high levels of multiplexing from low to high levels of throughput multiplexing refers to the number of individual pieces of information that are simultaneously extracted from one sample we believe the molecular diagnostics market will require systems which are extremely high throughput and cost effective in the mid to lowmultiplex range to address this market we acquired the veracode technology through our acquisition of cyvera corporation in april 2005 based on digitally encoded microbeads veracode enables lowcost multiplexing from 1 to 384plex in a single well we plan to implement the veracode technology using our newly designed beadxpress system and our existing assays we believe that this system will enable lower multiplex genotyping gene expression and protein based assays in the research market we expect our customers to utilize our beadarray technology for their higher multiplex projects and then move to our beadxpress system for their lower multiplex projects utilizing the same assays additionally we believe that the cost and multiplex advantages of the beadxpress system using our veracode technology will be welcomed in the molecular diagnostics market we expect to launch the beadxpress system during the first quarter of 2007 along with several assays for the system 

 

oligator technology 

 

genomic applications require many different short pieces of dna that can be made synthetically called oligos we have developed our proprietary oligator technology for the parallel synthesis of many different oligos to meet the requirements of largescale genomics applications we believe that our oligator technology is substantially more cost effective and provides significantly higher throughput than available commercial alternatives our synthesis machines are computer controlled and utilize many robotic processes to minimize the amount of labor used in the manufacturing process in 2005 we implemented our fourthgeneration oligator technology which is capable of manufacturing over 13000 different oligos per run this is an improvement over prior generations of technology where we could only manufacture approximately 3000 oligos per run this increase in scale was necessary to enable us to support the manufacture of oligos under our collaboration with invitrogen as well as to support our increased internal need for oligos a critical component of our beadarray technology for product sales and new product development 

 

sequencing technology 

 

our dna sequencing technology acquired as part of the solexa merger which was completed on january 26 2007 is based on use of our sequencingbysynthesis sbs biochemistry in sbs single stranded dna is extended from a priming site one base at a time using reversible terminator nucleotides these are dna bases which can be added to a growing second strand but which initially cannot be further extended this means that at each cycle of the chemistry only one base can be added each base which is added includes a fluorescent label which is specific to the particular base thus following incorporation the fluorescence can be imaged its color determined and the base itself can be inferred once this is done an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the block that had prevented further extension of the second strand this allows another base to be added and the cycle can be repeated we have shown data in which this cycle is repeated up to 50 times thus determining dna sequences which are up to 50 bases long this may well increase in the future as we further develop this technology the reversible terminator bases which we use are novel synthetic molecules which we manufacture they are not well incorporated by naturally occurring polymerases so we have also developed proprietary enzymes for this purpose both the nucleotides and enzymes are the subject of significant intellectual property 

 

in our dna sequencing systems we apply the sbs biochemistry on microscopic islands of dna these are called dna clusters each cluster starts as a single dna molecule typically a few hundred bases long attached to the inside surface of a flow cell we then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create copies of each starting molecule as the copies are made they are covalently linked to the surface so they cannot diffuse away after a number of cycles of amplification each cluster might have 500 to 1000 copies of the original starting molecule but still be only about a micron onemillionth of a meter in diameter by making so many copies the fluorescent signal from each cluster is significantly increased because the clusters are so small though tens of millions of clusters can be independently formed inside a single flow cell this large number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of sbs biochemistry and electronic imaging 

 

key advantages of our technology 

 

we believe that our technology provides distinct advantages in a variety of applications over competing technologies by creating costeffective highly miniaturized arrays with the following characteristics 

 

high throughput the miniaturization of our beadarray technology provides very high information content per unit area to increase sample throughput we have formatted our array matrix in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates allowing throughput levels of up to nearly 150000 unique assays per microtiter plate and we use laboratory robotics to speed process time similarly we have patterned our wholegenome expression beadchips to support up to 48000 gene expression assays for six samples with each beadchip and our wholegenome genotyping beadchips to support up to 650000 genotypes with each beadchip our infinium and goldengate assays are supported by full automation and lims to address high throughput laboratories our illumina genome analyzer can analyze the dna sequences of tens of millions of clusters at one time 

 

cost effectiveness our array products substantially reduce the cost of our customers’ experiments as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances in fiber optics plasma etching processes digital imaging and bead chemistry in addition our products require smaller reagent volumes than other array technologies thereby reducing reagent costs for our customers our oligator technology further reduces reagent costs as well as reducing our cost of coating beads used in our beadarray and veracode technologies we expect the illumina genome analyzer to allow dna sequencing at 1100th of the cost of conventional capillary instruments 

 

flexibility we are able to offer flexible solutions to our customers based on our ability to attach different kinds of molecules including dna rna proteins and other chemicals to our beads in addition we can have beadchips manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes with wells organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different markets and market segments in combination the use of beads and etched wells provides the flexibility and scalability for our beadarray technology to be tailored to perform many applications in many different market segments from drug discovery to diagnostics our oligator technology allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of oligos dna sequences determined with our illumina genome analyzer can also be used to identify larger dna or rna molecules from which the sequences have been derived which leads to a series of applications based on tag sequencing including digital gene expression analysis and microrna discovery and quantification 

 

quality and reproducibility the quality of our products is dependent upon each element in the system — the array the assay used to perform the experiment and the instrumentation and software used to capture the results each array is manufactured with a high density of beads which enables us to have multiple copies of each individual bead type we measure the copies simultaneously and combine them into one data point this allows us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population of identical beads which permits the statistical calculation of a more reliable and accurate value for each data point finally the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on every array improving the overall quality of the data when we develop the assays used with our products we focus on performance cost and ease of use by developing assays that are easy to use we can reduce the potential for the introduction of error into the experiment we believe that this enables researchers to obtain high quality and reproducible data from their experiments additionally we manufacture substantially all of the reagents used in our assays allowing us to control the quality of the product delivered to the customer 

 

our strategy 

 

our goal is to make our beadarray beadxpress and illumina genome analyzer platforms the industry standard for products and services addressing the genetic analysis markets we plan to achieve this by 

 

  

products and services 

 

the first implementation of our beadarray technology the array matrix is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96well microtiter plate each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1500 unique assays the beadchip introduced in 2003 is fabricated in multiple configurations to support multiple applications and scanning technologies 

 

we have provided genotyping services using our proprietary beadarray technology since 2001 in addition we have developed our first genotyping and gene expression products based on this technology these products include disposable array matrices and beadchips goldengate and infinium reagent kits for snp genotyping beadarray reader scanning instruments and an evolving portfolio of custom and standard gene expression products 

 

snp genotyping 

 

in 2001 we introduced the first commercial application of our beadarray technology by launching our snp genotyping services product line since this launch we have had peak days in which we operated at over 60 million genotypes per day to our knowledge no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low cost 

 

we designed our first consumable beadarray product the array matrix for snp genotyping the array matrix uses a universal format that allows it to analyze any set of snps we have also developed reagent kits based on goldengate assay protocols and the beadarray reader a laser scanner which is used to read our array products 

 

depending on throughput and automation requirements our customers can select the system configuration to best meet their needs for productionscale throughput our beadlab would be appropriate and for moderatescale throughput our beadstation would be selected our beadlab includes our beadarray reader combined with lims standard operating procedures and analytical software and fluid handling robotics this productionscale system was commercialized in late 2002 and when installed this system can routinely produce millions of genotypes per day 

 

the beadstation a system for performing moderatescale genotyping designed to match the throughput requirements of individual research groups and core labs was commercialized in late 2003 the beadstation includes our beadarray reader and genotyping andor gene expression analysis software multiple beadstations can be configured to achieve different levels of desired throughput and are fully upgradeable to a full beadlab through various steps that add automation sample preparation equipment and lims capability 

 

in 2003 we announced the availability of an assay set for genetic linkage analysis this standard product has been deployed in our genotyping services operation and is also sold to customers who use our snp genotyping systems genetic linkage analysis can help identify chromosomal regions with potential disease associations across a related set of samples 

 

in 2005 we announced the introduction of the major histocompatability complex mhc panel set which allows the interrogation of a difficulttoassay area of the genome often associated with autoimmune diseases in addition we announced the introduction of mouse6 and mouseref8 gene expression beadchip allowing the study of the levels of gene expression in mouse model 

 

in 2005 we commenced shipping the sentrix human1 genotyping beadchip for wholegenome genotyping this beadchip provides to scientists the ability to interrogate over 100000 snps located in highvalue genetic regions of the human genome also in the fourth quarter of 2005 we began shipping the new sentrix humanhap300 genotyping beadchip to customers around the world using the infinium assay which enables us to select virtually any snp in the genome the humanhap300 beadchip allows analysis of more than 317000 snps we selected the snps for inclusion on the chip in collaboration with a consortium of scientists that are leaders in the genotyping field we believe this product’s quality and performance support our expectation that it will become an important discovery tool for researchers seeking to understand the genetic basis of common yet complex diseases 

 

in 2006 we introduced several new snp genotyping products including 

 

 9 

 

  

through an application called copy number polymorphisms the humanhap family of beadchips also provides highresolution information on amplifications deletions and loss of heterozygosity throughout the genome abnormalities common in cancers and congenital diseases in addition we announced additional standard panels in the first quarter of 2006 including mouse linkage and cancer panels 

 

gene expression profiling 

 

with the addition of application specific accessory kits our productionscale beadlabs and beadstations are capable of performing a growing number of applications including gene expression profiling 

 

in 2003 we introduced our focused set gene expression products on both the array matrix and beadchip platforms our system includes a beadarray reader for imaging array matrices and beadchips a hybridization chamber and software for data extraction in addition we have developed standard gene expression products for each of the human mouse and arabidopsis genomes with an additional panel that focuses on human toxicology 

 

in 2005 we began shipment of the human6 and humanref8 expression beadchip products both products allow largescale expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip and are imaged using our beadarray reader the human6 beadchip is designed to analyze six discrete wholehumangenome samples on one chip interrogating in each sample approximately 48000 transcripts from the estimated 30000 genes in the human genome the humanref8 beadchip product analyzes eight samples in parallel against 24000 transcripts from the roughly 22000 genes represented in the consensus refseq database a wellcharacterized wholegenome subset used broadly in genetic analysis we expect that these gene expression beadchips will dramatically reduce the cost of wholegenome expression analysis allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of largescale biological experimentation in 2006 we began shipment of the ratref12 which analyzes twelve samples in parallel against 22226 transcripts from the roughly 21910 genes represented in the refseq database release 16 

 

scanning instrumentation 

 

the beadarray reader an instrument we developed is a key component of both our productionscale beadlab and our benchtop beadstation this scanning equipment uses a laser to read the results of experiments that are captured on our arrays and was designed to be used in all areas of genetic analysis that use our array matrices and beadchips in the second quarter of 2006 we began shipment of the autoloader which automates beadchip loading and scanning and increases lab throughput the autoloader is designed to support up to two beadarray readers simultaneously for unattended operation 

 

highthroughput oligo synthesis 

 

we have put in place a stateoftheart oligo manufacturing facility this facility serves both the commercial needs under our collaboration with invitrogen and our internal needs in addition to their use to coat beads these oligos are components of the reagent kits for our beadarray products and are used for assay development we manufacture oligos in a wide range of lengths and in several scales with the ability to add many types of modifications we offer a range of quality control options and have implemented a laboratory information management system to control much of the manufacturing process in 2005 we stopped selling oligos directly into the market and began shipping oligos under our collaboration with invitrogen 

 

our collaborative partners 

 

invitrogen corporation 

 

in december 2004 we entered into a strategic collaboration with invitrogen the goal of the collaboration is to combine our expertise in oligo manufacturing with the sales marketing and distribution capabilities of invitrogen in connection with the collaboration we have developed the next generation oligator dna synthesis technology this technology includes both plateand tubebased capabilities under the terms of the agreement invitrogen paid us an upfront nonrefundable collaboration payment of 23 million in the first quarter of 2005 additionally upon the achievement of a certain milestone invitrogen was obligated to make a milestone payment of 11 million to us during 2005 this milestone was achieved and the milestone payment was received we used these funds to invest in our san diego facility to enable the development and implementation of fourthgeneration oligator technology and to extend the technology into the larger market for tubebased oligo products we began manufacturing and shipping the platebased and certain tubebased oligo products under the collaboration in the third quarter of 2005 in addition the agreement provides for the transfer of our oligator technology into two invitrogen facilities outside north america collaboration profit from the sale of collaboration products is divided equally between the two companies 

 

decode genetics 

 

in may 2006 we executed a joint development and licensing agreement the development agreement with decode genetics ehf decode pursuant to the development agreement the parties agreed to collaborate exclusively to develop validate and commercialize specific diagnostic tests for variants in genes involved in three diseaserelated pathways the geneencoding leukotriene a4 hydrolase linked to heart attack the geneencoding transcription factor 7like 2 tcf7l2 linked to type 2 diabetes and the geneencoding bard1 linked to breast cancer with decode we are developing diagnostic tests based on these variants for use on our beadxpress system under the agreement we will be responsible for the manufacturing marketing and selling of the diagnostic products the companies will share the development costs of these products and split the profits from sales of the diagnostics tests the development agreement may be terminated as to a particular product under development if one party decides to discontinue funding the development of that product and may be terminated in whole by either party if the other party commits an uncured material breach files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent under a separate supply agreement we installed instrumentation at decode that will enable decode to perform whole genome association studies on up to 100000 samples using the our sentrix humanhap300 beadchips and associated reagents 

 

intellectual property 

 

we have an extensive patent portfolio including as of february 1 2007 ownership of or exclusive licenses to 106 issued us patents and 149 pending us patent applications including five allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents some of which derive from a common parent application this portfolio includes patents acquired as part of the solexa merger on january 26 2007 our issued patents which are directed at various aspects of our array assay oligo synthesis instrument and chemical detection technologies expire between 2011 and 2024 we are seeking to extend the patents directed at the full range of our technologies we have received or filed counterparts for many of these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries 

 

we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products 

 

we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements with third parties which grant us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing technologies assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment we have exclusive licenses from tufts university to patents that are directed at our use of beadarray technology these patents were filed by dr david walt a member of our board of directors the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2010 and 2020 we also have additional nonexclusive licenses from various third parties for other components of our products in all cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect 

 

research and development 

 

we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize our beadarray and oligator technologies and to support commercialization of the products and services derived from these technologies as of december 31 2006 we had a total of 144 employees engaged in research and development activities 

 

our research and development expenses for 2006 2005 and 2004 inclusive of charges relating to stockbased compensation of 39 million 01 million and 03 million respectively were 334 million 278 million and 215 million respectively compared to 2006 we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of overall revenue during 2007 as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts including research and development projects associated with our acquisition of solexa 

 

marketing and distribution 

 

our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving sequencing snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and agricultural research our potential customers include pharmaceutical biotechnology agrichemical diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic or private research centers the genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will be ultimately driven by among other items 

 

  

we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america major european markets japan and singapore in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in smaller markets in the pacific rim countries and europe we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products we expect to significantly increase our sales and distribution resources during 2007 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products 

 

manufacturing 

 

we manufacture our array platforms reagent kits scanning equipment and oligos inhouse our manufacturing capacity for beadchips has increased approximately fourfold over the level as of january 1 2006 we intend to continue to increase capacity as needed to manufacture our products in sufficient quantity to meet our business plan for 2007 we are focused on continuing to enhance the quality and manufacturing yield of our array matrices and beadchips and are exploring ways to continue increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process in addition we have implemented information management systems for many of our manufacturing and services operations to manage all aspects of material and sample use we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances 

 

we intend to add capacity to manufacture array matrices and beadchips throughout 2007 we currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our products we intend to continue and may extend the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing process to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best commercial interests 

 

competition 

 

although we expect that our beadarray products and services will provide significant advantages over currently available products and services we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the snp genotyping gene expression and sequencing markets these include companies such as affymetrix agilent amersham biosciences acquired by ge corp and now named ge healthcare applera corporation applied biosystems beckman coulter caliper technologies luminex monogram biosciences nimblegen perlegen sciences roche diagnostics in partnership with 454 life sciences sequenom and third wave technologies some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we need to address and in some cases a large installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in the future in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over the existing products rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies although we believe that our technology and products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful 

 

segment and geographic information 

 

we operate in one business segment for the development manufacture and commercialization of tools for genetic analysis our operations are treated as one segment as we only report operating results on an aggregate basis to our chief operating decision maker our chief executive officer 

 

during 2006 815 million or 44 of our total revenue came from shipments to customers outside the united states compared to 280 million or 38 in 2005 sales to territories outside of the united states are generally denominated in us dollars we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue we have sales support resources in western europe and direct sales offices in japan singapore and china in addition we have distributor relationships in various countries in the pacific rim region and europe 

 

seasonality 

 

historically customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation although demand for our products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as academic customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the government’s fiscal year 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are dedicated to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials which subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had a total of 596 employees 73 of whom hold phd degrees 43 of our employees with phd degrees are engaged in fulltime research and development activities none of our employees are represented by a labor union we consider our employee relations to be positive

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

 

litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services or impact our stock price 

 

our commercial success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and on our ability to protect our own intellectual property as we have previously disclosed affymetrix inc filed a complaint against us in july 2004 alleging infringement of six of its patents 

 

on june 30 2006 the court dismissed a patent affymetrix had sought to withdraw from its suit leaving five patents being asserted against us on august 16 2006 the court issued a ruling on the claim construction hearing that it had held on april 20 2006 as part of this litigation we believe the court’s mixed ruling interpreted certain claim terms in our favor and did not adversely impact our defenses and counterclaims which are still pending at the request of both parties trial has been rescheduled to march 5 2007 from october 16 2006 a pretrial conference was held on february 8 2007 during which the court established a multiphase trial structure with the first phase of the trial to begin on march 5 2007 and addressed related issues any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling throughout these proceedings may have an adverse impact on our stock price and such impact may be disproportionate to the actual import of the ruling itself 

 

third parties including affymetrix have asserted or may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets we expect that competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to develop further commercialize and sell products and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost if at all we could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties which could negatively affect our gross margins in addition we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and maintain profitability 

 

we expect intense competition in our target markets which could render our products obsolete result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell this would limit our ability to compete and maintain profitability if we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products our revenue may not grow as intended 

 

we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using technologies such as twodimensional electrophoresis capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry flow cytometry microfluidics nanotechnology nextgeneration dna sequencing and mechanically deposited inkjet and photolithographic arrays we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards changes in customer needs emerging competition new product introductions and strong price competition for example prices per data point for genotyping have fallen significantly over the last two years and we anticipate that prices will continue to fall one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we do furthermore life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could develop competing products if we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

 

any inability to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position 

 

our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant challenges in protecting their proprietary rights abroad these challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights abroad 

 

the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries including our patent position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued questions as to inventorship may also arise for example in june 2005 a former employee filed a complaint against us claiming he is entitled to be named as joint inventor of certain of our us patents and pending us and foreign patent applications and seeking a judgment that the related patents and applications are unenforceable any finding that our patents and applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies which may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

 

in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies also our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace furthermore these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 

 

we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information we have taken security measures to protect our confidential information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information among other things we seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants nevertheless employees collaborators or consultants may still disclose our confidential information and we may not otherwise be able to effectively protect our trade secrets accordingly others may gain access to our confidential information or may independently develop substantially equivalent information or techniques 

 

if we are unable to develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

we currently possess limited facilities capable of manufacturing our principle products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use if a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services also many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system lims additionally as part of the decoding step in our array manufacturing process we record several images of each array to identify what bead is in each location on the array and to validate each bead in the array this requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it would adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and may prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

 

our manufacturing capacity may limit our ability to sell our products 

 

we continue to ramp up our capacity to meet our anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe that we have sufficient plans in place to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our business plan in 2007 and 2008 there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility and launch new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

 

if we are unable to find thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture components of our products we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner or at all 

 

the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources for example we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles and beadchip slides included in our products from single vendors if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components we will be unable to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 

 

we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions that could adversely affect our business 

 

we acquired solexa in january 2007 and cyvera corporation in april 2005 and we may in the future acquire technology products or businesses related to our current or future business we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions further these potential acquisitions entail risks uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business for example we may not be able to successfully integrate a company’s operations technologies products and services information systems and personnel into our business an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial resources and divert management’s attention away from our other business concerns in connection with these acquisitions we assumed certain liabilities and hired certain employees which is expected to continue to result in an increase in our research and development expenses and capital expenditures there may also be unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with an acquisition that could adversely affect our operating results to finance any acquisitions we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration which would result in dilution to our stockholders additionally an acquisition may have a substantial negative impact on nearterm expected financial results 

 

the success of the solexa merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies growth opportunities and cost savings from integrating solexa’s businesses with our businesses our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of solexa the integration of two independent companies is a complex costly and timeconsuming process the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among other factors 

 

 20 

 

  

if we are unable to successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the merger such anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition we and solexa have operated and will continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees diversion of each company’s management’s attention the disruption or interruption of or the loss of momentum in each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company 

 

the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger as a result of our failure to achieve anticipated revenue growth following the merger 

 

solexa’s business faces significant risks these risks include the fact that solexa’s technology is at the development stage and although solexa has accepted orders for its genome analyzer and has shipped and installed those systems solexa has not completed performance specifications for those systems and has not invoiced customers for them there can be no assurance it will be able to do so these risks also include those described under the caption “risk factors” of solexa’s quarterly report on form 10q filed with the securities and exchange commission for the quarterly period ended september 30 2006 and may include additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently do not believe are material if any of the events or circumstances underlying these risks actually occur solexa’s business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed and as a result solexa may among other things fail to achieve the anticipated revenue growth following the merger 

 

the merger will cause dilution of illumina’s earnings per share 

 

the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are expected to have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share at least through 2007 due to losses of solexa the additional shares of illumina common stock that were issued in the merger the transaction and integrationrelated costs and other factors such as the potential failure to realize any benefit from synergies anticipated in the merger these factors could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

solexa had a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 if additional material weaknesses are identified in the future current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our consolidated financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading of our common stock 

 

as of december 31 2005 solexa did not maintain effective control over the application of gaap related to the financial reporting process this control deficiency resulted in numerous adjustments being required to bring solexa’s financial statements into compliance with gaap additionally this deficiency could have resulted in material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected accordingly solexa’s management determined that this control deficiency constituted a material weakness because of this material weakness solexa’s management concluded that as of december 31 2005 it did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on those criteria should we or our independent registered public accounting firm determine in future fiscal periods that there are material weaknesses in our consolidated internal controls over financial reporting including solexa the reliability of our financial reports may be impacted and our results of operations or financial condition may be harmed and the price of our common stock may decline 

 

we expect that our results of operations will fluctuate this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 

 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly accordingly if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain annual profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price could decline 

 

we have a limited history of commercial sales of systems and consumable products and our success depends on our ability to develop commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our new and relatively unproven technologies 

 

we may not possess all of the resources capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all the products or services that may result from our technologies sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems only began in 2003 and some of our other technologies are in the early stages of commercialization or are still in development you should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting similarly situated companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries we must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale and we currently have fewer resources available for research and development activities than some of our competitors we may not be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner or at all or they may not meet customer requirements or be of sufficient quality or at a price that enables us to compete effectively in the marketplace problems frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and relatively unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services in addition we may need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of our products or services which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

 

historically life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have analyzed genetic variation and biological function using a variety of technologies in order to be successful our products must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

 

market acceptance will depend on many factors including 

 

  

our sales marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products 

 

we currently have fewer resources available for sales and marketing and technical support services compared to some of our primary competitors in order to effectively commercialize our sequencing genotyping and gene expression systems and other products to follow we will need to expand our sales marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services in addition we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place and the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business 

 

we have only recently achieved annual operating profitability 

 

prior to 2006 we had incurred net losses each year since our inception as of december 31 2006 our accumulated deficit was 1046 million our ability to sustain annual profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses sfas no 123r is also likely to adversely affect our future profitability we expect to continue incurring significant expenses related to research and development sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products and the continued development of our manufacturing capabilities in addition we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products even if we maintain profitability we may not be able to increase profitability on a quarterly basis 

 

we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth these difficulties could impair our profitability 

 

we have experienced and we may expect to continue to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans which will place a strain on our human and capital resources if we are unable to manage this growth effectively our profitability could suffer our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 

 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by various internal and external factors these factors include but are not limited to earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof changes in tax rates future levels of research and development spending and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings any new interpretative guidance relating to accounting for uncertain tax positions could adversely affect our tax provision 

 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel we may be unable to achieve our goals 

 

we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer john stuelpnagel our senior vice president and chief operating officer and john west our senior vice president and general manager of dna sequencing  the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies 

 

our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies including the life sciences and healthcare industries thus we will need to add new personnel including management and develop the expertise of existing management the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 

 

a significant portion of our sales are to international customers 

 

approximately 44 and 38 of our revenue for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 respectively was derived from shipments to customers outside the united states we intend to continue to expand our international presence and export sales to international customers and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow export sales entail a variety of risks including 

 

  

in addition sales to international customers typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection we are also subject to general geopolitical risks such as political social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function 

 

we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function namely snp genotyping and gene expression profiling both of these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and biological function in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to achieve or sustain annual profitability

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

we have incurred substantial costs in defending ourselves against patent infringement claims and expect to devote substantial financial and managerial resources to protect our intellectual property and to defend against the claims described below as well as any future claims asserted against us 

 

affymetrix litigation 

 

on july 26 2004 affymetrix inc affymetrix filed a complaint in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging that the use manufacture and sale of our beadarray products and services including our array matrix and beadchip products infringe six affymetrix patents affymetrix seeks an injunction against the sale of products if any that are determined to infringe these patents unspecified monetary damages interest and attorneys’ fees on september 15 2004 we filed our answer to affymetrix’ complaint seeking declaratory judgments from the court that we do not infringe the affymetrix patents and that such patents are invalid we also filed counterclaims against affymetrix for unfair competition and interference with actual and prospective economic advantage 

 

on february 15 2006 the court allowed us to file our first amended answer and counterclaims adding allegations of inequitable conduct with respect to all six asserted affymetrix patents violation of section 2 of the sherman act and unclean hands in march 2006 affymetrix notified us of its decision to drop one of the six patents from the suit and of its intention to assert infringement of certain additional claims of the remaining five patents we have filed a motion to preclude affymetrix from asserting infringement of those additional claims that motion is still pending at this time on june 30 2006 the court dismissed the patent affymetrix had sought to withdraw from the suit both parties filed summary judgment motions by the july 14 2006 deadline established by the court on august 16 2006 the court issued a ruling on the claim construction hearing that it had held on april 20 2006 we believe the court’s opinion construed several key claim terms in our favor and did not adversely impact our defenses and pending counterclaims in any material respect trial has been rescheduled to march 5 2007 from october 16 2006 at the request of both parties a pretrial conference was held on february 8 2007 during which the court established a multiphase trial structure with the first phase of the trial to begin on march 5 2007 and addressed related issues we believe we have meritorious defenses against each of the infringement claims alleged by affymetrix and intend to defend vigorously against this suit however we cannot be sure that we will prevail in this matter any unfavorable determination and in particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by us or prohibition of the sale of our products and services could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend  

the following discussion and analysis should be read with “item 6 selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the discussion and analysis in this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans objectives expectations and intentions words such as “anticipate” “believe” “continue” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “may” “plan” “potential” “predict” “project” or similar words or phrases or the negatives of these words may identify forwardlooking statements but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking examples of forwardlooking statements include among others statements regarding the integration of solexa’s and cyvera’s technology with our existing technology the commercial launch of new products including products based on solexa’s and cyvera’s technology and the duration which our existing cash and other resources is expected to fund our operating activities 

 

forwardlooking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in “item 1a risk factors” as well as those discussed elsewhere the risk factors and other cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as applying to all related forwardlooking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form 10k 

 

overview 

 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and marketer of nextgeneration life science tools and integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function using our proprietary technologies we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing genotyping and gene expression markets and we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics our customers include leading genomic research centers pharmaceutical companies academic institutions clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 

 

on january 26 2007 we completed the acquisition of solexa for approximately 131 million shares of our common stock solexa develops and commercializes genetic analysis technologies used to perform a range of analyses including whole genome resequencing gene expressing analysis and small rna analysis we believe our combined company is the only company with genomescale technology for genotyping gene expression and sequencing the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 

 

our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and service projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 

 

prior to 2006 we incurred substantial operating losses as of december 31 2006 our accumulated deficit was 1046 million and total stockholders’ equity was 2473 million losses prior to 2006 have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research development and manufacturing scaleup effort required to commercialize our products and services an acquired inprocess research and development charge of 158 million related to our acquisition of cyvera in 2005 and a charge of 59 million in 2004 related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research development and manufacturing scaleup activities over the next several years we will also need to increase our selling general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems other products and services 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates assumptions and judgments with respect to the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates 

 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements certain accounting policies are deemed critical if 1 they require an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur or different estimates that we reasonably could have used would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue consists of sales of arrays reagents instrumentation and oligos service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping services extended warranty sales and revenue earned from milestone payments 

 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met all revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 

 

revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of instrumentation is recognized when earned which is generally upon shipment however in the case of beadlabs revenue is recognized upon the completion of installation training and customer acceptance revenue for genotyping services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered to the customer or as specific milestones are achieved 

 

in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable we ensure there are no refund rights if payment terms are based on future performance or a right of return exists we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured revenue recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 

 

sales of instrumentation generally include a standard oneyear warranty we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts which are generally for one or two years upon the expiration of the initial warranty revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates gross margins could be adversely affected 

 

while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions emerging issues task force eitf no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine that the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

 

some of our agreements contain multiple elements that include milestone payments revenue from a milestone achievement is recognized when earned as evidenced by acknowledgement from our collaborator provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement ii the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process iii the milestone payment is nonrefundable and iv the performance obligations for both us and our collaborators after the milestone achievement will continue at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement if all of these criteria are not met the milestone achievement is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement we defer nonrefundable upfront fees received under our collaborations and recognize them over the period the related services are provided or over the estimated collaboration term using various factors specific to the collaboration advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 

 

research revenue consists of amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances could be required 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supercede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycle and development plans product expiration and quality issues historical experience and our current inventory levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

 

contingencies 

 

we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses if losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies currently we have no such liabilities recorded this may change in the future depending upon new developments 

 

income taxes 

 

in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 

 

due to the adoption of sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment we recognize excess tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to sharebased compensation have been realized we follow the withandwithout approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions under this approach excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 

 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

 

the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to at least annual impairment tests the amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization and the amount assigned to iprd is expensed immediately determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets especially requires the exercise of judgment while there are a number of different acceptable generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired we primarily use the discounted cash flow method this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis in addition other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 

 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projection and timing of future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows perpetual growth rates determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect if our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets we could incur additional impairment charges as of december 31 2006 we had 21 million of goodwill this goodwill is reported as a separate line item in the balance sheet we have performed our annual test of goodwill as of may 1 2006 and have determined there has been no impairment of goodwill as of december 31 2006 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r sharebased payment under the provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fairvalue as calculated by the blackscholesmerton bsm optionpricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility forfeiture rates and expected option life if any of these assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

 

results of operations 

 

to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 31 2006 january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 stated as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

 

comparison of years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 

 

our fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 were both 52 weeks 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

total revenue for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 was 1846 million and 735 million respectively this represents an increase of 1111 million for 2006 or 151 compared to 2005 

 

product revenue increased to 1558 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 578 million for the year ended january 1 2006 the increase in 2006 resulted primarily from higher consumable and beadstation sales growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to the launch and shipment of our whole genome genotyping products the humanhap300 and humanhap550 beadchips in addition growth in consumable revenue can be attributed to the growth in our installed base of beadarray readers which has nearly doubled since january 1 2006 consumable products constituted 66 of product revenue for year ended december 31 2006 compared to 47 in the year ended january 1 2006 we expect to see continued growth in product revenue which can be partially attributed to the launch of several new products as well as the growth of our installed base of instruments 

 

service and other revenue increased to 275 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 139 million for the year ended january 1 2006 the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to the completion of several significant infinium and goldengate snp genotyping service contracts we introduced our infinium services in early 2006 we expect sales from snp genotyping services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed the timing of completion of a snp genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the customer’s schedule for delivering the snps and samples to us 

 

government grants and other research funding decreased to 13 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 18 million for the year ended january 1 2006 due primarily to the completion of several projects funded by grants from the national institutes of health we do not expect research revenue to be a material component of our revenue going forward 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue 

 

 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead installation warranty packaging and delivery costs as well as costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf of our customers costs related to research revenue are included in research and development expense cost of product revenue increased to 513 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 199 million for the year ended january 1 2006 primarily driven by higher consumable and instrument sales cost of product revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 included stockbased compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r totaling 13 million gross margin on product revenue increased to 671 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 655 for the year ended january 1 2006 the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the impact of favorable product mix as well as decreased manufacturing costs a higher percentage of our revenue in 2006 was generated from the sale of consumables which generally have a more favorable gross margin than other products the decrease in manufacturing costs is primarily due to reduced raw material costs as a result of more favorable negotiated contracts with our vendors and improvements in our manufacturing processes this increase in gross margin was offset in part by the impact of stockbased compensation charges which decreased our gross margin by 83 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

cost of service and other revenue increased to 81 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 33 million for the year ended january 1 2006 primarily due to higher service revenue cost of service and other revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 included stockbased 

compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r totaling 02 million gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to 706 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 766 for the year ended january 1 2006 the decrease is due primarily to a change in the mix of projects as well as the impact of stockbased compensation charges the latter having decreased our service and other revenue gross margin by 85 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

we expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross margins however we expect our market to become increasingly price competitive and our margins may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 

 

research and development expenses 

 

 

 

our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design development testing and enhancement of our products we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 

 

research and development expenses increased to 334 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 278 million for the year ended january 1 2006 research and development expenses for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 included stockbased compensation expenses primarily resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r totaling 39 million and 01 million respectively exclusive of these stockbased compensation charges the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 is primarily due to the development of our recentlyacquired veracode technology purchased in conjunction with our acquisition of cyvera in april 2005 the company plans to launch its first products resulting from this acquisition during the first quarter of 2007 research and development expenses related to the veracode technology increased 27 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended january 1 2006 in addition costs to support our oligator technology platform and beadarray research activities decreased 10 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended january 1 2006 

 

we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets accordingly we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base and integrate the operations of solexa into our business 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing finance human resources business development legal and general management as well as professional fees such as expenses for legal and accounting services selling general and administrative expenses increased to 541 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 282 million for the year ended january 1 2006 selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 included stockbased compensation expenses primarily resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r totaling 89 million and 02 million respectively 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased 106 million during the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended january 1 2006 the increase is primarily due to increases of 65 million attributable to personnelrelated expenses 32 million of stockbased compensation expense and 

09 million attributable to other nonpersonnelrelated costs mainly sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products general and administrative expenses increased 153 million during the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended january 1 2006 due to increases of 55 million of stockbased compensation expense 53 million in outside legal costs related to the affymetrix litigation 31 million in personnelrelated expenses associated with the growth of our business and 14 million in outside consulting costs outside consulting costs primarily include tax and audit fees and general legal expenses not associated with the affymetrix litigation 

 

we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff add sales and marketing infrastructure incur increased litigation costs and incur additional costs to support the growth in our business 

 

interest income 

 

 

 

interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 54 million and 14 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 respectively the increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher effective interest rates compared to the prior year 

 

interest and other expense net 

 

 

 

interest and other expense net consists of interest expense other income and expenses related to foreign exchange transaction costs and gains and losses on disposals of assets interest and other expense net decreased to 06 million for the year ended january 1 2006 compared to 07 million for the year ended january 2 2005 

 

interest expense was 11000 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 7000 for the year ended january 1 2006 for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 we recorded approximately 04 million in losses due to foreign currency transactions in addition in 2006 we recorded 01 million related to losses on disposal of assets compared to 03 million of losses in 2005 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

the provision for income taxes was approximately 27 million in 2006 up from 02 million in 2005 in 2006 the provision principally consists of federal and state alternative minimum tax and income tax expense related to foreign operations in 2005 the provision for income taxes consisted of income tax expense related to foreign operations 

 

during the year ended december 31 2006 we utilized approximately 259 million and 166 million of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards respectively to reduce our federal and state income taxes as of december 31 2006 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately 764 million and 391 million respectively which begin to expire in 2022 and 2013 respectively unless previously utilized in addition we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 64 million and 63 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019 respectively unless previously utilized 

 

pursuant to section 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization previous limitations due to section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of december 31 2006 

 

based upon the available evidence as of december 31 2006 we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not the remaining deferred tax assets in the us will be realized therefore we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the us deferred tax assets of approximately 365 million 

 

comparison of years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 

 

our fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 were 52 and 53 weeks respectively 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

total revenue for the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 was 735 million and 506 million respectively this represents an increase of 229 million for 2005 or 45 compared to 2004 

 

product revenue increased to 578 million for the year ended january 1 2006 from 405 million for the year ended january 2 2005 the increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher beadstation consumable and to a lesser extent oligo sales growth in consumable sales was due to the launch of several new products as well as the growth in our installed base of beadstations as of january 1 2006 we had shipped a total of 126 beadarray readers 

 

service and other revenue increased to 139 million in 2005 from 81 million in 2004 the increase in service and other revenue was primarily due to higher demand for thirdparty snp genotyping service contracts during the 2005 period in addition due to the achievement of a milestone associated with our collaboration agreement with invitrogen we recognized revenue of 11 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 these increases were partially offset by decreased revenue related to the international hapmap project we completed all revenuegenerating genotyping services for the international hapmap project early in the first quarter of 2005 we expect sales from thirdparty snp genotyping services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed the timing of completion of a snp genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the customer’s schedule for delivering the snps and samples to us 

 

government grants and other research funding decreased to 18 million for the year ended january 1 2006 from 20 million for the year ended january 2 2005 due primarily to a decrease in internal research spending for our grants from the national institutes of health 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue 

 

 

 

cost of product and service and other revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead installation warranty packaging and delivery costs as well as costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf of our customers costs related to research revenue are included in research and development expense cost of product and service and other revenue increased to 232 million for the year ended january 1 2006 compared to 133 million for the year ended january 2 2005 due primarily to the significant increase in product revenue gross margin on product and service and other revenue was 68 for 2005 compared to 73 for 2004 

 

cost of product revenue increased to 199 million for the year ended january 1 2006 compared to 116 million for the year ended january 2 2005 due to the significant increase in product revenue gross margin on product revenue decreased to 66 for the year ended january 1 2006 compared to 71 for the year ended january 2 2005 the decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the impact of product mix a higher percentage of our revenue in 2005 was generated from the sale of instrumentation which generally has a lower gross margin than other products other factors contributing to the decrease include decreased gross margins related to our consumable and oligo sales lower consumable margins can be primarily attributed to lower average selling prices on consumable sales in 2005 compared to 2004 which were partially offset by decreased manufacturing costs in addition the gross margin associated with oligo products sold as a part of the invitrogen collaboration was lower when compared to the prior year the change in oligo gross margin was due to the fact that under the invitrogen collaboration we no longer sell oligos directly as a result the gross margin related to this product line decreased however the net margin has increased due to the fact that most of the sales and marketing expenses surrounding the oligo business have shifted to our collaboration partner invitrogen 

 

cost of service and other revenue increased to 33 million for the year ended january 1 2006 compared to 17 million for the year ended january 2 2005 gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to 77 for the year ended january 1 2006 from 79 in the year ended january 2 2005 the decrease is due primarily to a change in the mix of projects and decreased average selling prices 

 

we expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross margins however we expect our market to become increasingly price competitive and our margins may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter

interest income 

 

 

 

interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 14 million and 09 million for the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 respectively the increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher effective interest rates compared to the prior year

our financing activities provided 1093 million in the in the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 60 million in the year ended january 1 2006 cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december 31 2006 was primarily due to 965 million in net proceeds from a public stock offering completed in may 2006 as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases totaling 114 million cash provided from financing activities in the year ended january 1 2006 was primarily proceeds from the issuance of common stock from option exercises 

 

in february 2007 we issued 400 million principal amount of 0625 convertible senior notes due 2014 the net proceeds from the offering after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses were approximately 3903 million we used approximately 202 million of the net proceeds to purchase shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering we used 466 million of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which are designed to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for other general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions and additional purchases of our common stock the notes mature on february 15 2014 and bear interest semiannually at a rate of 0625 per year payable on february 15 and august 15 of each year beginning on august 15 2007 in addition we may in certain circumstances be obligated to pay additional interest if a “designated event” as defined in the indenture for the notes occurs holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition upon conversion of the notes we must pay the principal portion in cash the notes will become convertible only in certain circumstances based on conditions relating to the trading price of the notes and our common stock or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events however the notes will be convertible at any time from and including november 15 2013 through the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding february 15 2014 

 

we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next twelve months operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures at the present time we have no material commitments for capital expenditures however our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with affymetrix our ability to successfully commercialize our sequencing systems and to expand our snp genotyping services product lines scientific progress in our research and development programs the magnitude of those programs competing technological and market developments and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings therefore we may require additional funding in the future 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

 

we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2006 we were not involved in any spe transactions 

 

in january 2002 we purchased two newly constructed buildings and assumed a 260 million tenyear mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 836 in june 2004 we entered into a conditional agreement to sell our land and buildings for 420 million and to lease back such property for an initial term of ten years the sale was completed in august 2004 at which time the lease was signed after the repayment of the remaining 252 million debt and other related transaction expenses we received 155 million in net cash proceeds we removed the land and net book value of the buildings of 369 million from our balance sheet and are recording the resulting 37 million gain on the sale of the property over the lease term in accordance with sfas no 13 accounting for leases under the terms of the lease we made a 19 million security deposit with monthly rental payments of 318643 for the first year with an annual increase of 3 in each subsequent year through 2014 the current monthly rent under this lease is 338048 on february 14 2007 we extended this lease the terms of the new lease provide for monthly rent increases each year to a maximum of 504710 per month during the last year of the lease which is now 2023 we have the option to extend the term of the lease for three additional fiveyear periods

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate sensitivity 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

although most of our revenue is realized in us dollars some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local currencies accordingly the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

 

periodically we hedge significant foreign currency firm sales commitments and accounts receivable with forward contracts we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one year or less these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly to the extent effective any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported in other comprehensive income realized gains and losses for the effective portion are recognized with the underlying hedge transaction as of december 31 2006 we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding the notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 were 0 and 01 million respectively as of january 1 2006 we had one outstanding contract with an immaterial fair value representing an unrealized gain which was included in other current assets at january 1 2006 we settled foreign exchange contracts of 01 million and 52 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 respectively we did not hold any derivative financial instruments prior to fiscal 2004

we have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the securities exchange act as of december 31 2006 based upon that evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2006 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that a the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and b such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functons as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures our management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level because of inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues if any within a company have been detected 

 

an evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2006 and that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting that evaluation did not identify any such change 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

 

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control — integrated framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2006

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

 

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

illumina inc 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that illumina inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria illumina inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that illumina inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion illumina inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the coso criteria 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2006 of illumina inc and our report dated february 23 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

overview 

  we were incorporated in april 1998 we develop and market nextgeneration tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine a key goal of genomics using our technologies we have developed a comprehensive line of products that are designed to provide the performance throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics this information is expected to correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states enhancing drug discovery allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients 

  in 2001 we began commercial sale of short pieces of dna called oligonucleotides which we refer to as oligos manufactured using our proprietary oligator technology we believe our oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies and this advantage enabled us to market our oligos under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins 

2   in 2001 we commercialized the first implementation of our beadarray technology the sentrix array matrix this is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96well microtiter plate each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1500 unique assays which enables researchers to perform focused genotyping experiments in a highthroughput format this format was also used to initiate our single nucleotide polymorphism “snp” genotyping services product line as a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput low cost beadarray technology we have entered into genotyping services contracts with many leading genotyping centers and were awarded 91 million from the national institutes of health to play a major role in the first phase of the international hapmap project 

  our productionscale beadlab is a turnkey platform that includes all hardware and software necessary to enable researchers to perform genetic analysis research on what we believe is an unprecedented scale this system is being marketed to a small number of highthroughput genotyping users as of january 1 2006 we have installed and recorded revenue for 11 beadlabs 

  in 2003 we announced the launch of several new products including 1 a new array format the sentrix beadchip which significantly expands market opportunities for our beadarray technology and provides increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers 2 a gene expression product line on both the sentrix array matrix and the sentrix beadchip that allows researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to 96 samples on a single array and 3 a benchtop snp genotyping and gene expression system the beadstation for performing moderatescale genotyping and gene expression using our technology the beadstation includes our beadarray reader analysis software and assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs sales of these products began in the first quarter of 2004 and as of january 1 2006 we have shipped 115 beadstations 

  in late 2004 we announced a strategic collaboration with invitrogen corporation “invitrogen” to synthesize and distribute oligos in the third quarter of 2005 we began shipping oligo products in connection with this agreement as part of the agreement we have developed the next generation of our oligator dna synthesis technology which we have designed to support both plate and tubebased capabilities invitrogen is responsible for sales marketing and technical support profits from sales of collaboration products are divided equally between the two companies 

  in 2005 we began shipments of sentrix beadchips for wholegenome gene expression and wholegenome genotyping the wholegenome gene expression beadchips are designed to enable highperformance costeffective wholegenome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of wholegenome expression analysis our wholegenome expression product line includes multisample products for both the human and mouse genomes the wholegenome genotyping beadchip is designed to scale to high levels of multiplexing without compromising data quality and to provide scientists the ability to query hundreds of thousands of snps in parallel in the second quarter of 2005 we commenced shipment of our first wholegenome genotyping beadchip the humanhap1 which interrogates more than 100000 snps in parallel 

  in april 2005 we completed the acquisition of cyvera corporation a privatelyheld connecticutbased company pursuant to which cyvera became a whollyowned subsidiary of illumina we believe that cyvera’s digitalmicrobead platform will be highly complementary to our portfolio of products and services the acquisition is expected to provide us with a comprehensive approach to beadbased assays for biomarker research and development and invitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities including those that require lowcomplexity as well as highcomplexity testing we expect the first products based on cyvera’s technology to be available in the second half of 2006 the purchase price associated with the transaction was approximately 178 million we allocated 158 million of this purchase price to acquired inprocess research and development and charged such amount against earnings in the second quarter of 2005 

3   in january 2006 we began shipment of the new sentrix humanhap300 genotyping beadchip to customers around the world using the infinium assay which enables us to select virtually any snp in the genome the humanhap300 beadchip offers genomic coverage for more than 317000 snps we selected the snp assays in collaboration with a consortium of scientists that are leaders in the genotyping field we believe this product has quality and performance features that support our expectation that it will become an important discovery tool for researchers seeking to understand the genetic basis of common yet complex diseases 

  we are seeking to continue to expand our customer base for our beadarray technology however we can give no assurance that our sales efforts will continue to be successful 

  we were incorporated in california in april 1998 we reincorporated in delaware in july 2000 our principal executive offices are located at 9885 towne centre drive san diego california 92121 our telephone number is 858 2024500 

industry background 

   every person inherits two copies of each gene one from each parent the two copies of each gene may be identical or they may be different these differences are referred to as genetic variation examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color genetic variation can also have important medical consequences including predisposition to disease and differential response to drugs genetic variation affects disease susceptibility including predisposition to cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease in addition genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug treatment some people may respond well others may not respond at all and still others may experience adverse side effects a common form of genetic variation is a snp a snp is a variation in a single position in a dna sequence it is estimated that the human genome contains over nine million snps 

  while in some cases a single snp will be responsible for medically important effects it is now believed that combinations of snps may contribute to the development of most major diseases since there are millions of snps it is important to investigate many representative wellchosen snps simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable information 

  another contributor to disease and dysfunction is the over or underexpression of genes within an organism’s cells a very complex network of genes interacts to produce healthy individuals the challenge for scientists is to delineate the associated genes’ expression patterns and their relationship to disease until recently this problem was addressed by investigating effects on a genebygene basis this is time consuming and difficulties exist when several pathways can not be observed or “controlled” at the same time with the advent of microarray technology thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time 

   snp genotyping is the process of determining which base a c g or t is present at a particular site in the genome within an individual or other organism the use of snp genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual snp or a collection of snps and to apply that information to clinical trials and diagnostic testing requires the analysis of millions of snp genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease for example a single large clinical trial could involve genotyping 300000 snps per patient in 1000 patients thus requiring 300 million assays using previously available technologies this scale of snp genotyping was both impractical and prohibitively expensive 

4   largescale snp genotyping can be used in a variety of ways including studies designed to understand the genetic contributions to disease disease association studies genomicsbased drug development clinical trial analysis disease predisposition testing and disease diagnosis snp genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare for example in the development of plants and animals with desirable commercial characteristics these markets will require billions of snp genotyping assays annually 

   gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mrna the intermediary messenger between genes dna and proteins variation in gene expression can cause disease or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease by comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different environments such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified studies of this type often used in drug discovery require monitoring thousands and preferably tens of thousands of mrnas in large numbers of samples once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples for example within a clinical trial 

  as gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more costeffective technologies 

our technologies 

   we have developed a proprietary array technology that enables the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously our beadarray technology provides a unique combination of high throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility we achieve high throughput with a high density of test sites per array and we are able to format arrays either in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various configurations in the format of standard microscope slides we seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools or sensors for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments we believe that these features have enabled our beadarray technology to become a leading platform for the emerging highgrowth market of snp genotyping and expect they will enable us to become a key player in the gene expression market 

  our proprietary beadarray technology combines microwells etched into a substrate and specially prepared beads that selfassemble into an array we have deployed our beadarray technology in two different sentrix array formats the array matrix and the beadchip our first beadbased product was the array matrix which incorporates fiber optic bundles the fiber optic bundles which we cut into lengths of less than one inch are manufactured to our specifications each bundle is comprised of approximately 50000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an aluminum plate which forms an array matrix beadchips are fabricated in microscope slideshaped sizes with varying numbers of sample sites per slide both formats are chemically etched to create tens to hundreds of thousands of wells for each sample site 

5   in a separate process we create sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make different batches of beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor for example we create a batch of snp sensors by attaching a particular dna sequence or oligo to each bead in the batch we combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to create a bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce thousands of arrays one of the advantages of this technology is that it allows us to create universal arrays for snp genotyping and by varying the reagent kit we are able to use the array to test for any combination of snps 

  to form an array a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells one bead per well the tens of thousands of beads in the wells comprise our individual arrays because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called ’decoding’ in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we employ several proprietary methods for decoding a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each bead type multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads we believe we are the only microarray company to provide this level of quality control in the industry 

  an experiment is performed by preparing a sample such as dna from a patient and introducing it to the array the design features of our array matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution containing the sample whereas our beadchip allows processing of samples on a slidesized platform the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated bead the beadarray reader detects the matched molecules by shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the beadchip since the molecules in the sample have a structure that causes them to emit light in response to a laser detection of a binding event is possible this allows the measurement of the number of molecules bound to each coated bead resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

   genomic applications require many different short pieces of dna that can be made synthetically called oligos for example snp genotyping may require three to four different oligos per assay a snp genotyping experiment analyzing 10000 snps may therefore require 30000 to 40000 different oligos contributing significantly to the expense of the experiment 

  we have developed our proprietary oligator technology for the parallel synthesis of many different oligos to meet the requirements of largescale genomics applications we believe that our oligator technology is substantially more cost effective and provides significantly higher throughput than available commercial alternatives our synthesis machines are computer controlled and utilize many robotic processes to minimize the amount of labor used in the manufacturing process in 2005 we implemented our fourthgeneration oligator technology which is capable of manufacturing up to 13000 different oligos per run this is an improvement over prior generations of technology where we could only manufacture approximately 3000 oligos per run this increase in scale was necessary to enable us to support the manufacture of oligos under our collaboration with invitrogen as well as to support our increased need for oligos a critical component of our beadarray technology 

   we believe that our beadarray and oligator technologies provide distinct advantages in a variety of applications over competing technologies by creating costeffective highly miniaturized arrays with the following advantages 

  high throughput the miniaturization of our beadarray technology provides very high information content per unit area to increase sample throughput we have formatted our array matrix in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates allowing throughput levels of up to nearly 150000 unique assays per microtiter plate and we use laboratory robotics to speed process time similarly we have patterned our wholegenome expression beadchips to support up to 48000 gene expression assays for six samples with each beadchip the oligator’s parallel synthesis capability allows us to manufacture the diversity of oligos necessary to support largescale genomic applications 

  cost effectiveness our array products substantially reduce the cost of experiments as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances in fiber optics plasma etching processes digital imaging and bead chemistry in addition these products require smaller reagent volumes than other array technologies and therefore reduce reagent costs our costeffective oligator technology further reduces reagent costs as well as the cost of coating beads 

  flexibility a wide variety of conventional chemistries are available for attaching different molecules such as dna rna proteins and other chemicals to beads by using beads we are able to take advantage of these chemistries to create a wide variety of sensors which we assemble into arrays using the same proprietary manufacturing process in addition we can have fiber optic bundles and beadchips manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes with wells organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different markets and market segments in combination the use of beads and etched wells provides the flexibility and scalability for our beadarray technology to be tailored to perform many applications in many different market segments from drug discovery to diagnostics our oligator technology allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of oligos 

  quality the quality of our products is dependent upon each element in the system the array the assay used to perform the experiment and the instrumentation and software used to capture the results 

  each array is manufactured with a high density of beads which enables us to have multiple copies of each individual bead type we measure the copies simultaneously and combine them into one data point this allows us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population of identical beads which permits the statistical calculation of a more reliable and accurate value for each data point finally the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on every array improving the overall quality of the data 

  when we develop the assays used with our products we focus on the performance cost and ease of use by developing assays that are easy to use we can minimize the potential for the introduction of experimental error into the experiment we believe that this enables the researcher to obtain high quality data from their experiments additionally we manufacture substantially all of the reagents used in our assays which allows us to control the quality of the product delivered to the customer 

our strategy 

  our goal is to make our beadarray platforms the industry standard for products and services utilizing array technologies we plan to achieve this by 

 7 

 products and services 

  the first implementation of our beadarray technology the sentrix array matrix is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96well microtiter plate each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1500 unique assays the beadchip introduced in 2003 is fabricated in multiple configurations to support multiple applications and scanning technologies 

  we have provided genotyping services using our proprietary beadarray technology since 2001 in addition we have developed our first genotyping and gene expression products based on this technology these products include disposable sentrix array matrices and beadchips goldengate and infinium reagent kits for snp genotyping beadarray reader scanning instruments and an evolving portfolio of custom and standard gene expression products 

   in 2001 we introduced the first commercial application of our beadarray technology by launching our snp genotyping services product line since this launch we have had peak days in which we operated at over two million genotypes per day based on individual samples to our knowledge no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low cost 

  we designed our first consumable beadarray product the sentrix array matrix for snp genotyping the sentrix array matrix uses a universal format that allows it to analyze any set of snps we have also developed reagent kits based on goldengate assay protocols and the beadarray reader a laser scanner which is used to read our array products 

  depending on throughput and automation requirements our customers can select the system configuration to best meet their needs for productionscale throughput our beadlab would be appropriate and for moderatescale throughput our beadstation would be selected our beadlab includes our beadarray reader combined with lims standard operating procedures and analytical software and fluid handling robotics this productionscale system was commercialized in late 2002 and when installed this system can routinely produce millions of genotypes per day 

  the beadstation a system for performing moderatescale genotyping designed to match the throughput requirements of individual research groups and core labs was commercialized in late 2003 the beadstation includes our beadarray reader and genotyping andor gene expression analysis software our beadstations are fully upgradeable to a full beadlab through various steps that add automation sample preparation equipment and lims capability for use in custom snp genotyping both the beadlab and beadstation utilize goldengate assay reagents and our array matrix 

  in 2003 we announced the availability of an assay set for genetic linkage analysis this standard product has been deployed in our genotyping services operation and is also sold to customers who use our snp genotyping systems genetic linkage analysis can help identify chromosomal regions with potential disease associations across a related set of samples 

  in 2004 we announced a new sentrix human1 genotyping beadchip for wholegenome genotyping this beadchip provides to scientists the ability to interrogate over 100000 snps located in highvalue genetic regions of the human genome in 2006 we announced the sentrix humanhap300 genotyping beadchip for largerscale snps studies which can assay more than 317000 snps displayed across the entire human genome 

8   in 2005 we announced the mhc panel set which allows the interrogation of a difficultto assay area of the genome often associated with autoimmune diseases in addition we announced the mouse6 and mouseref8 gene expression beadchip allowing the study of the levels of gene expression in mouse model 

   with the addition of application specific accessory kits our productionscale beadlabs and beadstations are capable of performing a growing number of applications including gene expression profiling 

  in 2003 we introduced our focused set gene expression products on both the sentrix array matrix and sentrix beadchip platforms our system includes a beadarray reader for imaging sentrix array matrices and beadchips a hybridization chamber and software for data extraction in addition we have developed standard gene expression products for each of the human mouse and arabidopsis genomes with an additional panel that focuses on human toxicology 

  in 2005 we began shipment of the sentrix human6 and humanref8 expression beadchip products both products allow largescale expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip and are imaged using our beadarray reader the human6 beadchip is designed to analyze six discrete wholehumangenome samples on one chip interrogating in each sample approximately 48000 transcripts from the estimated 30000 genes in the human genome the humanref8 beadchip product analyzes eight samples in parallel against 24000 transcripts from the roughly 22000 genes represented in the consensus refseq database a wellcharacterized wholegenome subset used broadly in genetic analysis we expect that these gene expression beadchips will dramatically reduce the cost of wholegenome expression analysis allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of largescale biological experimentation 

   the beadarray reader an instrument we developed is a key component of both our productionscale beadlab and our benchtop beadstation this scanning equipment uses a laser to read the results of experiments that are captured on our arrays and was designed to be used in all areas of genetic analysis that use our sentrix array matrices and sentrix beadchips 

   we have put in place a state of the art oligo manufacturing facility this facility serves both the commercial needs under our collaboration with invitrogen and our internal needs in addition to their use to coat beads these oligos are components of the reagent kits for our beadarray products and are used for assay development we manufacture oligos in a wide range of lengths and in several scales with the ability to add many types of modifications we offer a range of quality control options and have implemented a laboratory information management system to control much of the manufacturing process in 2003 we introduced the first standard product offerings in our oligator product line a wholegenome oligo reference set designed and optimized for spotted gene expression microarrays and in 2004 we introduced a mouse genome oligo set also for use on spotted gene expression arrays in 2005 we stopped selling oligos directly into the market and began shipping oligos under our collaboration with invitrogen 

9 collaboration with invitrogen corporation 

  in december 2004 we entered into a strategic collaboration with invitrogen the goal of the collaboration is to combine our expertise in oligo manufacturing with the sales marketing and distribution capabilities of invitrogen in connection with the collaboration we have developed the next generation oligator ® dna synthesis technology this technology includes both plate and tubebased capabilities under the terms of the agreement invitrogen paid us an upfront nonrefundable collaboration payment of 23 million in the first quarter of 2005 additionally upon the achievement of a certain milestone invitrogen was obligated to make a milestone payment of 11 million to us as of january 1 2006 this milestone has been achieved and the milestone payment was received we have used these funds to invest in our san diego facility to enable the development and implementation of fourthgeneration oligator technology and to extend the technology into tubebased oligo products we began manufacturing and shipping the platebased and certain tubebased oligo products under the collaboration in the third quarter of 2005 in addition the agreement provides for the transfer of our oligator technology into two invitrogen facilities outside north america collaboration profit from the sale of collaboration products will be divided equally between the two companies 

research and development 

  we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize our beadarray and oligator technologies and to support commercialization of the products and services derived from these technologies these efforts include the following among others 

 10 

   our research and development expenses for 2005 2004 and 2003 inclusive of charges relating to stockbased compensation of 01 million 03 million and 13 million respectively were 277 million 211 million and 225 million respectively as compared to 2005 we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars during 2006 as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts but decrease as a percentage of overall revenue in 2006 

government grants 

  government grants allow us to fund internal scientific programs and exploratory research we retain ownership of all intellectual property and commercial rights generated during these projects subject to a nonexclusive nontransferable paidup license to practice for or on behalf of the united states inventions made with federal funds this license is retained by the us government as provided by applicable statutes and regulations we do not believe that the retained license will have any impact on our ability to market our products and we do not need government approval with respect to this license in order to enter into collaborations or other relationships with third parties we were the recipient of a grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the first phase of the international hapmap project which is a 100 million internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform diseaserelated research we received 91 million of funding for this project which covered basic research activities the development of snp assays and the genotyping to be performed on those assays all of which was earned in prior years except for approximately 08 million which was recognized as revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 

intellectual property 

  we have an extensive patent portfolio including as of february 1 2006 ownership of or exclusive licenses to 38 issued us patents and 102 pending us patent applications including six allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents some of which derive from a common parent application our issued patents which cover various aspects of our array assay oligo synthesis instrument and chemical detection technologies expire between 2011 and 2022 we are seeking to extend this patent protection on our beadarray dasl goldengate infinium cyvera oligator sentrix array of arrays and related technologies we have received or filed counterparts for many of these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries 

11   we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our beadarray dasl goldengate infinium sentrix array of arrays cyvera and oligator technologies 

  we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements with third parties which grant us rights to use key aspects of our array technology assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment we have exclusive licenses from tufts university to patents that cover our use of beadarray technology these patents were filed by dr david walt a member of our board of directors the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2010 and 2019 in 2001 we entered into a nonexclusive license agreement with amersham biosciences that covers certain technology contained in our beadarray reader in 2002 we obtained a nonexclusive license from dade behring marburg gmbh that relates to certain components of our goldengate assay we also have additional nonexclusive licenses from various third parties for other components of our products in all cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect 

marketing and distribution 

  our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and agricultural research our potential customers include pharmaceutical biotechnology agrichemical diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic or private research centers the genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will be ultimately driven by among other items 

   we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america major european markets japan and singapore in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in markets outside of these areas primarily the pacific rim countries and europe we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products we expect to significantly increase our sales and distribution resources during 2006 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products 

  in 2004 we entered into a strategic collaboration with invitrogen with a goal of leveraging our strength in oligo synthesis with invitrogen’s extensive sales marketing and distribution channels we transitioned all responsibility for oligo sales marketing and technical support to invitrogen in the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 

12 manufacturing 

  we manufacture our array platforms reagent kits scanning equipment and oligos inhouse and believe that we currently have the ability to manufacture these in sufficient quantity to meet our business plan for 2006 we currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our products we intend to continue and may extend the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing process to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best commercial interests 

  during 2001 we moved into a new facility which allowed us to design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific processes and optimize material flow and personnel movement in addition we have implemented information management systems for many of our manufacturing and services operations to manage all aspects of material and sample use we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances 

competition 

  although we expect that our beadarray products and services will provide significant advantages over currently available products and services we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the snp genotyping and gene expression markets these include companies such as aclara biosciences acquired by virologic affymetrix agilent amersham biosciences acquired by ge corp and now named ge healthcare applied biosystems beckman coulter caliper technologies luminex parallele bioscience acquired by affymetrix perlegen sciences nimblegen sequenom and third wave technologies some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we need to address and in some cases a large installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in the future in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over the existing products rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies although we believe that our technology and products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful 

segment and geographic information 

  we operate in one business segment for the development manufacture and commercialization of tools for genetic analysis our operations are treated as one segment as we only report operating results on an aggregate basis to chief operating decision makers of illumina 

  during 2005 280 million or 38 of our total revenue came from customers outside the united states as compared to 264 million or 52 in 2004 sales to territories outside of the united states are generally denominated in us dollars we expect that sales to international customers will be an important and growing source of revenue we have sales support resources in western europe and direct sales offices in japan singapore and china in addition we have distributor relationships in various countries in the pacific rim region and europe 

  information about the geographies in which we operate can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements at note 11 “segment information geographic data and significant customers” 

13 seasonality 

  historically customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation although demand for our products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year as academic customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the government’s fiscal year 

environmental matters 

  we are dedicated to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials which subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

employees 

  as of january 1 2006 we had a total of 375 employees 73 of whom hold phd degrees 44 of our employees with phd degrees are engaged in fulltime research and development activities none of our employees are represented by a labor union we consider our employee relations to be positive

 item 1a risk factors tableend   our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

   our commercial success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property affymetrix inc filed a complaint against us in july 2004 alleging infringement of six of its patents and other third parties have asserted or may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets we expect that competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets in addition third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims we may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights against others furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to further develop commercialize and sell products and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost or at all in that event we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain profitability 

   we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and function and other applications using technologies such as twodimensional electrophoresis capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry flow cytometry microfluidics nextgeneration dna sequencing and mechanically deposited inkjet and photolithographic arrays we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards changes in customer needs emerging competition new product introductions and strong price competition one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we have furthermore the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could develop competing products if we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

   in 2005 we acquired cyvera corporation and may in the future acquire technology products or businesses related to our current or future business we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions further these potential acquisitions entail risks uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business for example we may not be able to successfully integrate a company’s operations technologies products and services information systems and personnel into our business an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial resources and divert management’s attention away from our other business concerns in connection with the cyvera acquisition we assumed certain liabilities and hired certain employees of cyvera which is expected to result in an increase in research and development expenses and our capital expenditures there may also be unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with an acquisition that could adversely affect our operating results 

   we have incurred net losses each year since our inception as of january 1 2006 our accumulated deficit was 1446 million and we incurred a net loss of 209 million for the year ended january 1 2006 we recorded a modest profit in the fourth quarter of 2005 and we may not be profitable in 2006 due in part to the impact of statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123r which is expected to add additional expense of 90 million to 120 million in 2006 our ability to maintain or increase profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses we expect to continue incurring significant expenses for research and development for developing our manufacturing capabilities and for sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products in addition we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the launch of new products as a result we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we grow and consequently we will need to generate significant additional revenue to maintain profitability even if we maintain profitability we may not be able to increase profitability on a quarterly basis 

   in december 2004 we entered into a collaboration agreement with invitrogen to sell and market our oligos worldwide under the terms of the collaboration invitrogen is responsible for sales marketing and technical support while we are responsible for the manufacture of the collaboration products as invitrogen is solely responsible for the sales and marketing support of the collaboration our continued growth and profitability related to these products depends on the extent to which invitrogen is successful in penetrating the oligo market and selling the collaboration products if invitrogen is not successful in selling the collaboration products our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

   we may not possess all of the resources capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all the products or services that may result from our technologies sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems only began in 2003 and some of our other technologies are in the early stages of commercialization or are still in development you should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting similarly situated companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries we must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale and we currently have fewer resources available for research and development activities than many of our competitors we may not be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner or at all or they may not meet customer requirements or be of sufficient quality or at a price that enables us to compete effectively in the marketplace problems frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and relatively unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services in addition we may need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of our products or services which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

  historically life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a variety of technologies in order to be successful our products must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function 

  market acceptance will depend on many factors including 

 17 

   our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad these problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights 

  the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries including our patent position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we intend to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they are issued questions as to inventorship may also arise for example a former employee recently filed a complaint against us claiming he is entitled to be named as joint inventor of certain of our us patents and pending us and foreign patents and seeking a judgment that the related patents and applications are unenforceable see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a description of this complaint any finding that our patents and applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology and a finding that others have inventorship rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain licenses to practice the technology which may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

  in addition our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies also our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace 

  we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants nevertheless employees collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets in addition others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 

   we are currently ramping up our capacity to meet our anticipated demand for our products although we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe that we have plans in place to help ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our business plan in 2006 there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner for example manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility and launch new products as a result we may experience difficulties in meeting customer collaborator and internal demand in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions and demand for our products could decline additionally in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

   we currently have fewer resources available for sales and marketing and technical support services as compared to our primary competitors in order to effectively commercialize our genotyping and gene expression systems and other products to follow we will need to expand our sales marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services in addition we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place and the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business 

   we currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use if a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services also many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our customdesigned laboratory information management system “lims” additionally as part of the decoding step in our array manufacturing process we record several images of each array to identify what bead is in each location on the array and to validate each bead in the array this requires significant network and storage infrastructure if either our lims system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time it would adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and may prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period 

   the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources for example we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles and beadchip slides included in our products from single vendors if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components we will be unable to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 

   we expect to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans which will place a strain on our human and capital resources if we are unable to manage this growth effectively our losses could increase our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 

   our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and services the need for capital expenditures to support and expand our business the progress and scope of our research and development projects the filing prosecution and enforcement of patent claims the outcome of our legal proceedings with affymetrix the defense of any future litigation involving us and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents revenue from sales and funding from grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs barring unforeseen developments however this expectation is based upon on our current operating plan which may change as a result of many factors consequently we may need additional funding in the future our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts in addition we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations such as an acquisition even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 

  we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital available as of january 1 2006 to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 

   we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer and john stuelpnagel our senior vice president and chief operating officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies 

  our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies including the life sciences and healthcare industries thus we will need to add new personnel including management and develop the expertise of existing management the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 

   approximately 38 of our revenue for the year ended january 1 2006 was derived from customers outside the united states we intend to continue to expand our international presence and export sales to international customers and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow export sales entail a variety of risks including 

   in addition sales to international customers typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection we are also subject to general geopolitical risks such as political social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

   we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and function namely snp genotyping and gene expression profiling both of these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and function in addition factors affecting research and development spending generally such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions could harm our business if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 

   our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry the timing and amount of government grant funding programs and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quarterto quarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly accordingly if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to maintain profitability any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth in 2006 or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price probably would decline

overview 

  we were incorporated in april 1998 we develop and market nextgeneration tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine a key goal of genomics using our technologies we have developed a comprehensive line of products that are designed to provide the performance throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics this information is expected to correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states enhancing drug discovery allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients 

27   in 2001 we began commercial sale of short pieces of dna called oligonucleotides which we refer to as oligos manufactured using our proprietary oligator technology we believe our oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies and this advantage enabled us to market our oligos under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins 

  in 2001 we commercialized the first implementation of our beadarray technology the sentrix array matrix this is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96well microtiter plate each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1500 unique assays which enables researchers to perform focused genotyping experiments in a highthroughput format this format was also used to initiate our single nucleotide polymorphism “snp” genotyping services product line as a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput low cost beadarray technology we have entered into genotyping services contracts with many leading genotyping centers and were awarded 91 million from the national institutes of health to play a major role in the first phase of the international hapmap project 

  our productionscale beadlab is a turnkey platform that includes all hardware and software necessary to enable researchers to perform genetic analysis research on what we believe is an unprecedented scale this system is being marketed to a small number of highthroughput genotyping users as of january 1 2006 we have installed and recorded revenue for 11 beadlabs 

  in 2003 we announced the launch of several new products including 1 a new array format the sentrix beadchip which significantly expands market opportunities for our beadarray technology and provides increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers 2 a gene expression product line on both the sentrix array matrix and the sentrix beadchip that allows researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to 96 samples on a single array and 3 a benchtop snp genotyping and gene expression system the beadstation for performing moderatescale genotyping and gene expression using our technology the beadstation includes our beadarray reader analysis software and assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs sales of these products began in the first quarter of 2004 and as of january 1 2006 we have shipped 115 beadstations 

  in late 2004 we announced a strategic collaboration with invitrogen corporation “invitrogen” to synthesize and distribute oligos in the third quarter of 2005 we began shipping oligo products in connection with this agreement as part of the agreement we have developed the next generation of our oligator dna synthesis technology which we have designed to support both plate and tubebased capabilities invitrogen is responsible for sales marketing and technical support profits from sales of collaboration products are divided equally between the two companies 

  in 2005 we began shipments of sentrix beadchips for wholegenome gene expression and wholegenome genotyping the wholegenome gene expression beadchips are designed to enable highperformance costeffective wholegenome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of wholegenome expression analysis our wholegenome expression product line includes multisample products for both the human and mouse genomes the wholegenome genotyping beadchip is designed to scale to high levels of multiplexing without compromising data quality and to provide scientists the ability to query hundreds of thousands of snps in parallel in the second quarter of 2005 we commenced shipment of our first wholegenome genotyping beadchip the humanhap1 which interrogates more than 100000 snps in parallel 

28   in april 2005 we completed the acquisition of cyvera corporation a privatelyheld connecticutbased company pursuant to which cyvera became a whollyowned subsidiary of illumina we believe that cyvera’s digitalmicrobead platform will be highly complementary to our portfolio of products and services the acquisition is expected to provide us with a comprehensive approach to beadbased assays for biomarker research and development and invitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities including those that require lowcomplexity as well as highcomplexity testing we expect the first products based on cyvera’s technology to be available in the second half of 2006 the purchase price associated with the transaction was approximately 178 million we allocated 158 million of this purchase price to acquired inprocess research and development and charged such amount against earnings in the second quarter of 2005 

  in january 2006 we began shipment of the new sentrix humanhap300 genotyping beadchip to customers around the world using the infinium assay which enables us to select virtually any snp in the genome the humanhap300 beadchip offers genomic coverage for more than 317000 snps we selected the snp assays in collaboration with a consortium of scientists that are leaders in the genotyping field we believe this product has quality and performance features that support our expectation that it will become an important discovery tool for researchers seeking to understand the genetic basis of common yet complex diseases 

  our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and service projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry the timing and amount of government grant funding programs and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth in 2006 or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 

  we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception as of january 1 2006 our accumulated deficit was 1446 million and total stockholders’ equity was 725 million these losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services an acquired inprocess research and development charge of 158 million related to our acquisition of cyvera and a charge of 59 million related to a terminationof employment lawsuit we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years we will also need to significantly increase our selling general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems other products and services as a result of the expected increase in expenses we will need to increase revenue significantly to achieve sustained profitability 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates assumptions and judgments with respect to the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates 

29   our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements certain accounting policies are deemed critical if 1 they require an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur or different estimates that we reasonably could have used would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above 

  we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

   our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services product revenue consists of sales of arrays reagents instrumentation and oligos service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping services extended warranty sales and revenue earned from milestone payments as described below significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 

  we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 under sab no 104 revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

  revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of instrumentation is recognized when earned which is generally upon shipment however in the case of beadlabs revenue is recognized upon the completion of installation training and the receipt of customer acceptance revenue for genotyping services is recognized when earned which is generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered to the customer or as specific milestones are achieved 

  in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable we ensure there are no refund rights if payment terms are based on future performance we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured we defer revenue recognition until the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment changes in judgments and estimates made in determining whether the criteria of sab no 104 have been met might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized 

  sales of instrumentation generally include a standard oneyear warranty we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts which are generally for one or two years upon the expiration of the initial warranty revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates our gross margins could be adversely affected 

30   while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions emerging issues task force “eitf” no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine that the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

  some of our agreements contain multiple elements that include milestone payments revenue from a milestone achievement is recognized when earned as evidenced by acknowledgement from our collaborator provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement ii the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process iii the milestone payment is nonrefundable and iv the performance obligations for both us and our collaborators after the milestone achievement will continue at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement if all of these criteria are not met the milestone achievement is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement we defer nonrefundable upfront fees received under our collaborations and recognize them over the period the related services are provided or over the estimated collaboration term using various factors specific to the collaboration advance payments we receive in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 

  a third source of revenue research revenue consists of amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred all revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 

   we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances could be required 

   we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supercede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycle and development plans product expiration and quality issues historical experience and our current inventory levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

   we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses if losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 accounting for contingencies  currently we have no such liabilities recorded this may change in the future depending upon new developments in each matter 

   the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired including inprocess research and development “iprd” goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests the amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization and the amount assigned to iprd is expensed immediately determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets especially requires the exercise of judgment while there are a number of different acceptable generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired we primarily use the discounted cash flow method this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis in addition other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 

  during 2001 we adopted sfas no 142 sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projection and timing of future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows perpetual growth rates determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect if our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets we could incur additional impairment charges as of january 1 2006 we had 21 million of goodwill this goodwill is reported as a separate line item in the balance sheet for fiscal 2005 

32 recently issued accounting standards 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 share based payment “sfas 123r” which is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  this statement supercedes accounting principles bulletin “apb” opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 95 statement of cash flows  generally the approach in sfas no 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

  sfas no 123r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a “modified prospective” method or a “modified retrospective” method under the “modified prospective” method compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 123r for all sharebased payments granted after that date and based on the requirements for sfas no 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 123r under the “modified retrospective” method the requirements are the same as under the “modified prospective” method but companies may restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 123 we currently utilize the blackscholes model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees under the pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 while sfas no 123r permits companies to continue to use such model it also permits the use of a “lattice” model we have deterimined we will use the blackscholes model to measure the fair value of employee stock options under sfas no 123r the new standard is effective for companies that are not small business issuers like us beginning with the first reporting period during the first fiscal year beginning on or after june 15 2005 and we adopted sfas no 123r at the beginning of our new reporting period on january 2 2006 

  we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb no 25’s intrinsic value method and as such recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant accordingly the adoption of sfas no 123r’s fair value method is expected to result in significant noncash charges which will increase our reported operating expenses however it will have no impact on our cash flows the precise impact of adoption of sfas no 123r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the level of sharebased payments granted in the future however had we adopted sfas no 123r in prior periods we believe the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 151 on a prospective basis as of january 2 2006 sfas no 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material sfas no 151 requires that those items — if abnormal — be recognized as expenses in the period incurred in addition sfas no 151 requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversions based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 151 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

33 results of operations 

  to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended january 1 2006 january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 stated as a percentage of total revenue 

 comparison of years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 

  our fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 were 52 and 53 weeks respectively 

    total revenue for the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 was 735 million and 506 million respectively this represents an increase of 229 million for 2005 or 45 as compared to 2004 

34   product revenue increased to 578 million for the year ended january 1 2006 from 405 million for the year ended january 2 2005 the increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher beadstation consumable and to a lesser extent oligo sales growth in consumable sales was due to the launch of several new products as well as the growth in our installed base of beadstations as of january 1 2006 we have shipped a total of 115 beadstations and 11 beadlabs 

  service and other revenue increased to 139 million in 2005 from 81 million in 2004 the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to higher demand for thirdparty snp genotyping service contracts during the 2005 period in addition due to the achievement of a milestone associated with our collaboration agreement with invitrogen we recognized revenue of 11 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 these increases were partially offset by decreased revenue related to the international hapmap project we completed all revenuegenerating genotyping services for the international hapmap project early in the first quarter of 2005 we expect sales from thirdparty snp genotyping services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed the timing of completion of a snp genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the customer’s schedule for delivering the snps and samples to us 

  government grants and other research funding decreased to 18 million for the year ended january 1 2006 from 20 million for the year ended january 2 2005 due primarily to a decrease in internal research spending for our grants from the national institutes of health we expect revenue from government grants to decline in the future as we continue to expand our focus on commercial operations 

    cost of product and service and other revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead installation warranty packaging and delivery costs as well as costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf of our customers costs related to research revenue are included in research and development expense cost of product and service and other revenue increased to 232 million for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 133 million for the year ended january 2 2005 due primarily to the significant increase in product revenue gross margin on product and service and other revenue was 68 for 2005 as compared to 73 for 2004 

35   cost of product revenue increased to 199 million for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 116 million for the year ended january 2 2005 due to the significant increase in product revenue gross margin on product revenue decreased to 66 for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 71 for the year ended january 2 2005 the decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the impact of product mix a higher percentage of our revenue in 2005 was generated from the sale of instrumentation which generally has a lower gross margin than other products other factors contributing to the decrease include decreased gross margins related to our consumable and oligo sales lower consumable margins can be primarily attributed to lower average selling prices on consumable sales in 2005 as compared to 2004 which were partially offset by decreased manufacturing costs in addition the gross margin associated with oligo products sold as a part of the invitrogen collaboration was lower when compared to the prior year the change in oligo gross margin is due to the fact that under the invitrogen collaboration we no longer sell oligos directly as a result the gross margin related to this product line decreased however the net margin has increased due to the fact that most of the sales and marketing expenses surrounding the oligo business have shifted to our collaboration partner invitrogen 

  cost of service and other revenue increased to 33 million for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 17 million for the year ended january 2 2005 gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to 77 for the year ended january 1 2006 from 79 in the year ended january 2 2005 the decrease is due primarily to a change in the mix of projects and decreased average selling prices 

  we expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross margins however we expect our market to become increasingly price competitive and our margins may fluctuate 

    our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design development testing and enhancement of our products we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 

  research and development expenses increased to 277 million for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 211 million for the year ended january 2 2005 the increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to the development expenses incurred to develop our newlyacquired microbead technology purchased in conjunction with our acquisition of cyvera in april 2005 research and development expenses related to the microbead technology totaled approximately 32 million in 2005 additional factors contributing to the increased research and development expenses during 2005 relate to increased costs of 21 million associated with the cost of beadarray research activities and 13 million related to research costs to support our oligator technology platform we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets accordingly we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we expand our product base 

  stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was approximately 01 million for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 03 million for the year ended january 2 2005 

    our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing finance human resources business development legal and general management as well as professional fees such as expenses for legal and accounting services 

  selling general and administrative expenses increased to 280 million for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 251 million for the year ended january 2 2005 our sales and marketing expenses increased 36 million of which 27 million was attributable to personnel related expenses for the buildout of our sales force and customer support staff and 09 million is attributable to other nonpersonnelrelated costs including sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products general and administrative expenses decreased by 07 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 due primarily to a 25 million decrease in litigation expenses partially offset by a 15 million increase in personnelrelated expenses 

  we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to accelerate as we expand our staff add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur increased litigation costs and additional costs to support the commercialization and support of an increasing number of products 

  stock based compensation for selling general and administrative employees directors and consultants was 02 million for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 05 million for the year ended january 2 2005 during 2005 we recorded noncash compensation expense for accelerated vesting of options for certain employees totaling approximately 01 million this compensation was provided as incentive to continue to work as key members of the sales team associated with the invitrogen collaboration 

    during the year ended january 1 2006 we recorded 158 million of acquired iprd resulting from the cyvera acquisition these amounts were expensed on the acquisition dates because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses at the acquisition date cyvera’s ongoing research and development initiatives were primarily the development of its microbead technology platform and optical instrumentationreader concepts the iprd charge related to the cyvera acquisition was made up of two projects that were approximately 50 and 25 complete at the date of acquisition the discount rate applied to calculate the iprd charge was 30 acquisitions of businesses products or technologies by us in the future may result in substantial charges for acquired iprd that may cause fluctuations in our interim or annual operating results there were no charges resulting from any acquisitions during the same period in 2004 

    since our inception in connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to employees founders and directors through july 25 2000 we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling approximately 176 million representing the difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated by our management for financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were granted or restricted common stock was sold deferred compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders’ equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the options and restricted stock in 2005 we recorded 02 million as deferred compensation related to unvested options associated with our acquisition of cyvera in addition in 2005 we granted a restricted stock award to an employee and recorded deferred stock compensation totaling 02 million during the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of approximately 03 million and 08 million respectively 

  we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for employees founders and directors using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with fasb interpretation no 28 for consultants deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with sfas no 123 and is periodically remeasured and expensed in accordance with eitf no 9618 

  in 2005 we recorded approximately 48000 as deferred compensation expense related to our acquisition of cyvera we also recorded noncash compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of options for certain employees totaling approximately 01 million this compensation was provided to these employees as incentive to continue to work as key members of the sales team associated with the invitrogen collaboration in addition in 2005 we granted a restricted stock award to an employee and recorded a noncash compensation charge of 21000 we expect expenses related to stockbased compensation to increase significantly beginning in 2006 as we implement the requirements of sfas no 123r although the adoption of sfas no 123r’s fair value method is expected to result in a significant increase in our reported operating expenses it will have no impact on our cash flows sfas no 123r is discussed further in “recently issued accounting standards” in item 7 and in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

  38   we recorded a 77 million charge in june 2002 to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a jury verdict in a terminationof employment lawsuit we appealed the decision and in december 2004 the fourth appellate district court of appeal in san diego california reduced the amount of the award during the appeal process the court required us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case was resolved during the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 we recorded 06 million and 08 million respectively of such interest charges as litigation expense as a result of the revised judgment we reduced the 92 million liability on our balance sheet to 59 million and recorded a gain of 33 million as a litigation judgment in the fourth quarter of 2004 in addition in august 2004 we recorded a 15 million gain as a result of a settlement with applera 

    interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 14 million and 09 million for the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 respectively the increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher effective interest rates compared to the prior year 

    interest and other expense consists of interest expense expenses related to foreign exchange transaction costs foreign income taxes and gains and losses on disposals of assets interest and other expense decreased to 08 million for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 17 million for the year ended january 2 2005 

  interest expense was 7000 for the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 14 million for the year ended january 2 2005 interest expense in the 2004 period relates primarily to a 260 million fixed rate loan that was paid off in august 2004 in connection with the sale of our san diego facilities 

  in the year ended january 1 2006 we recorded approximately 04 million in losses due to foreign currency transactions compared to 02 million in foreign currency transaction losses for the year ended january 2 2005 estimated foreign income taxes were approximately 02 million and 01 million for the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 respectively in addition in 2005 we recorded 03 million related to losses on disposal of assets there were no gains or losses on disposals in 2004 

   we incurred net operating losses for the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 and accordingly we did not pay any us federal or state income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain as of january 1 2006 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and california tax purposes of approximately 1037 million and 401 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 and 2006 respectively unless previously utilized 

39   as of january 1 2006 we also had us federal and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 41 million and 38 million respectively the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018 and the california carryforwards have no expiration 

  our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to section 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code and similar state provisions as a result of changes in our ownership structure cyvera corporation had an ownership change upon our acquisition during 2005 and accordingly its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitation these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization we are in the final stages of completing our formal section 382 and 383 analysis and it is anticipated that approximately 02 million of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 

   our fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 were 53 and 52 weeks respectively 

    revenue for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 was 506 million and 280 million respectively product revenue increased to 405 million in 2004 from 184 million in 2003 the increase resulted almost entirely from sales of consumables used on our beadlabs and beadstations and sales of our benchtop beadstations offset by fewer sales of our productionscale beadlabs in 2003 we had no sales of beadstations and we only began selling consumable products in may 2003 

  service revenue increased to 81 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 65 million in for the year ended december 28 2003 substantially all of this increase relates to snp genotyping services performed for the international hapmap project we are the recipient of a grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the first phase of the international hapmap project which is a 100 million internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform diseaserelated research we received 91 million of funding for this project which covered basic research activities the development of snp assays and the genotyping to be performed on those assays we had recognized revenue from this grant of 83 million through the end of 2004 the remaining 08 million of funding remaining related to this project was received and recognized as revenue in early 2005 

  government grants and other research funding decreased to 20 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 32 million for the year ended december 28 2003 primarily due to a decrease in internal research spending for our grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the international hapmap project 

    cost of product and service revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead installation warranty packaging and delivery costs as well as costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf of our customers costs related to research revenue are included in research and development expense 

  cost of product revenue increased to 116 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 74 million for the year ended december 28 2003 substantially all of this increase was driven by the sales of our beadstations and consumables gross margin on product revenue increased to 71 in the year ended january 2 2005 from 60 for the year ended december 28 2003 due primarily to increased sales of higher margin consumable products as well as efficiencies gained in oligo manufacturing 

  cost of service revenue decreased to 17 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 26 million for the year ended december 28 2003 gross margin on service revenue increased to 79 in the year ended january 2 2005 from 60 for the year ended december 28 2003 this decrease in cost and increase in gross margin is due primarily to efficiencies gained in snp genotyping services as well as lower costs of oligos used in the genotyping services process 

    our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design development testing and enhancement of our products we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred research and development expenses decreased 14 million to 211 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 225 million for the year ended december 28 2003 approximately 09 million of the decrease is attributable to personnelrelated expenses and related lab supplies and the majority of the remaining 05 million is attributable to lower manufacturingrelated resources needed to support research efforts and a decrease in depreciation expense 

  during the year ended january 2 2005 the cost of beadarray technology research activities decreased 04 million as compared to the year ended december 28 2003 the decrease is primarily the result of completing the development of several products that were commercially launched in late 2003 and 2004 such as our beadstation and focused gene set array products 

  research to support our oligator technology platform decreased 10 million in the year ended january 2 2005 as compared to the year ended december 28 2003 in the second quarter of 2003 we implemented additional oligator manufacturing and software enhancements to expand capacity increase throughput and further reduce operating costs in addition as we increase our product sales a smaller portion of our manufacturing resources are now used to support research efforts as compared to the same periods in 2003 

41   stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was 03 million for the year ended january 2 2005 as compared to 13 million for the year ended december 28 2003 

    our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing finance human resources business development and general management as well as professional fees such as expenses for legal and accounting services selling general and administrative expenses increased 62 million to 251 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 189 million for the year ended december 28 2003 approximately 52 million of the increase is due to higher sales and marketing costs of which 41 million is attributable to personnelrelated expenses and 07 million is attributable to an increase in facilityrelated expenses approximately 10 million of the increase in selling general and administrative expenses is related to general and administrative costs of which 04 million is related to personnelrelated expenses and the majority of the remaining 06 million is attributable to expenses associated with sarbanesoxley compliance and our international expansion 

  stock based compensation related to selling general and administrative employees directors and consultants was 05 million for the year ended january 2 2005 as compared to 12 million for the year ended december 28 2003 

    from our inception through july 27 2000 in connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to employees founders and directors we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling 176 million representing the difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated for financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were granted or such restricted stock was sold we recorded this amount as a component of stockholders’ equity and amortize the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock and options 

  we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of 08 million and 25 million for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 respectively we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for employees founders and directors using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with the fin no 28 for consultants deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with sfas no 123 and is periodically remeasured and expensed in accordance with eitf no 9618 

  42   we recorded a 77 million charge in june 2002 to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a jury verdict in a terminationof employment lawsuit we appealed the decision and in december 2004 the fourth appellate district court of appeal in san diego california reduced the amount of the award during the appeal process the court required us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case was resolved for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 we recorded 06 million and 08 million respectively of such interest charges as litigation expense as a result of the revised judgment we reduced the 92 million liability on our balance sheet to 59 million and recorded a gain of 33 million as a litigation judgment in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  in 1999 we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems group an operating group of applera corporation under which the companies agreed to jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray technology with applied biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology in conjunction with the agreement applied biosystems agreed to provide us with nonrefundable research and development support of 100 million all of which was paid by december 2001 and recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as of december 28 2003 in december 2002 applied biosystems initiated a patent infringement suit and sought to compel arbitration of an alleged breach of the joint development agreement we initiated a suit in state court seeking to enjoin the arbitration and alleged that applied biosystems had breached the joint development agreement in august 2004 we entered into a settlement and crosslicense agreement with applera as a result of the settlement we removed the 100 million liability from our balance sheet made a payment of 85 million to applera and recorded a gain of 15 million as a litigation settlement 

    interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 09 million and 18 million for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 respectively the decrease is due to lower effective interest rates partially offset by higher average cash balances 

    interest and other expense primarily consisted of interest expense which was 14 million and 22 million for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 respectively interest expense relates primarily to a 260 million fixed rate loan which was paid off in august 2004 in connection with the sale of our san diego facilities 

  in the year ended january 2 2005 we recorded approximately 150000 in losses due to foreign currency transactions as compared to approximately 5000 in gains for the year ended december 28 2003 estimated foreign income taxes were approximately 135000 and 45000 for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 respectively 

   we incurred net operating losses for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 and accordingly we did not pay any us federal or state income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain as of january 2 2005 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately 865 million and 391 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 unless previously utilized 

  as of january 2 2005 we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 31 million and 30 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 unless previously utilized 

liquidity and capital resources 

    as of january 1 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 508 million we currently invest our excess cash balances in us dollarbased shortterm money market mutual funds 

  our operating activities used cash of 90 million in the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 196 million in the year ended january 2 2005 net cash used in operating activities in the year ended january 1 2006 was primarily the result of a net loss from operations of 209 million a 60 million payment for a litigation judgment a 70 million increase in accounts receivable and a 65 million increase in inventory reduced by a 74 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities a 32 million increase in longterm liabilities primarily related to payments received from invitrogen recorded as deferred revenue noncash charges of 41 million for depreciation and amortization and a noncash acquired iprd charge of 158 million related to the cyvera acquisition the accounts receivable and inventory increases over the prior year are primarily due to our significant yearoveryear sales growth of 45 which resulted from increased customer demand and our introduction of new products and services into the market the increase in accounts payable and accrued liability balances was driven primarily by increases in general business activity associated with such sales growth as well as expenses associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure to accommodate this growth net cash used in operating activities in the year ended january 2 2005 was primarily the result of a net loss from operations of 62 million the payment of an 85 million legal settlement as described under “litigation judgment settlement net” a 72 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales and a 20 million increase in other assets primarily for the security deposit for the building lease reduced by noncash charges of 40 million for depreciation and amortization 

44   our investing activities used cash of 15 million in the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to providing cash of 570 million in the year ended january 2 2005 cash used in investing activities in the year ended january 1 2006 was due to 114 million used for the purchase of property and equipment and 24 million paid for the acquisition of cyvera reduced by 122 million from the sale or maturity of investment securities used to provide operating funds for our business cash provided by investing activities in the year ended january 2 2005 was due to 407 million in proceeds from the sale of our land and buildings net of fees and 197 million from the sale or maturity of investment securities net of purchases of investment securities used to provide operating funds for our business reduced by 34 million for the purchase of property and equipment 

  our financing activities provided 60 million in the year ended january 1 2006 as compared to 49 million for the year ended january 2 2005 cash provided from financing activities in the year ended january 1 2006 was due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of common stock from option exercises cash provided from financing activities in the year ended january 2 2005 was due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of common stock including 287 million of net proceeds from the sale of approximately 46 million shares of our common stock in may 2004 offset by the 254 million in longterm debt we paid off in connection with the sale of our land and buildings 

  in june 2002 we recorded a 77 million charge to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a terminationof employment lawsuit as a result of our decision to appeal the ruling we filed a surety bond with the court in october 2002 of 15 times the judgment amount or approximately 113 million under the terms of the bond we were required to maintain a letter of credit for 90 of the bond amount to secure the bond further we were required to deposit approximately 125 million of marketable securities as collateral for the letter of credit and accordingly these funds were restricted from use for corporate purposes a judgment was rendered in december 2004 and a 59 million payment was made in early 2005 at which time the restricted funds were released 

  we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents revenue from sales and funding from grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs barring unforeseen developments operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures at the present time we have no material commitments for capital expenditures however our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully commercialize our snp genotyping and gene expression systems and extensions to those products and to expand our oligos and snp genotyping services product lines scientific progress in our research and development programs the magnitude of those programs competing technological and market developments the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with affymetrix the success of our collaboration with invitrogen and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings therefore we may require additional funding in the future in addition we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations such as an acquisition even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans further any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights and any debt financing may carry covenants that could restrict our operations 

  in december 2003 we filed a shelf registration statement that would allow us to raise up to 65 million of funding through the sale of common stock in one or more transactions in may 2004 we raised approximately 287 million net of offering expenses through the sale of our common stock under this shelf registration statement 

   we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities “spes” which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of january 1 2006 we were not involved in any spe transactions 

  in january 2002 we purchased two newly constructed buildings and assumed a 260 million 10year mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 836 in june 2004 we entered into a conditional agreement to sell our land and buildings for 420 million and to lease back such property for an initial term of ten years the sale was completed in august 2004 at which time the lease was signed after the repayment of the remaining 252 million debt and other related transaction expenses we received 155 million in net cash proceeds we removed the land and net book value of the buildings of 369 million from our balance sheet and are recording the resulting 37 million gain on the sale of the property over the tenyear lease term in accordance with sfas no 13 accounting for leases  under the terms of the lease we made a 19 million security deposit with monthly rental payments of 318643 for the first year with an annual increase of 3 in each subsequent year through august 2014 the current monthly rent under this lease is 328202 the lease contains an option to renew for three additional periods of five years each 

  we also lease office space for a facility in connecticut an additional manufacturing storage facility in san diego and for three foreign facilities located in japan singapore and china under noncancelable operating leases that expire at various times through december 2008 these leases contain renewal options ranging from one to three years 

  as of january 1 2006 our contractual obligations are in thousands

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

   our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 

   although most of our revenue is realized in us dollars some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local currencies accordingly the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

  exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in operations in july 2004 we began hedging significant foreign currency firm sales commitments and accounts receivable with forward contracts we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes our forward exchange contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly to the extent effective any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported in other comprehensive income realized gains and losses for the effective portion are recognized with the underlying hedge transaction the notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 were 01 million and 40 million respectively as of january 1 2006 we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding this contract had a fair value of 882 representing an unrealized gain and was included in other current assets at january 1 2006 this contract is set to expire in march 2006 and is with a reputable bank institution as of january 2 2005 the outstanding contracts had a fair value of 02 million representing an unrealized loss and were included in other current liabilities at january 2 2005 we settled foreign exchange contracts of 52 million and 03 million for the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 respectively our hedging program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we believe we have hedged all significant firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and as a result any increase or decrease in the exchange rates of these commitments would have no material net effect to our balance sheet or our results of operations the company did not hold any derivative financial instruments prior to fiscal 2004

  we have evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether they are effective in ensuring that the disclosure of required information is timely made in accordance with the exchange act and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission this evaluation was made under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as of january 1 2006 our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

  an evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter and that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting that evaluation did not identify any such change 

  the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded based on their review that as of january 1 2006 our disclosure controls and procedures as defined by exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms in addition no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting has occurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 

48 management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

  we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control — integrated framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 1 2006 

  our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2006 has been audited by ernst  young llp independent registered public accounting firm this report from ernst  young llp which expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of january 1 2006 is included herein

illumina inc 

  we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that illumina inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria illumina inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  in our opinion management’s assessment that illumina inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion illumina inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2006 based on the coso criteria

overview 

  we are a leading developer and marketer of nextgeneration tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine a key goal of genomics our tools provide information that could be used to improve drugs and therapies customize diagnoses and treatment and cure disease 

  the sequencing of the human genome has driven demand for tools that can assist researchers in processing the billions of tests necessary to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information this requires functional analysis of highly complex biological systems involving a scale of experimentation not previously practical using our technologies we have developed a comprehensive line of products that can address the scale of experimentation and the breadth of functional analysis required to help achieve the goals of molecular medicine 

2   our patented beadarray technology uses microscopic beads randomly deposited in wells to achieve a level of miniaturization that allows for a new scale of experimentation a microarray is a collection of miniaturized test sites arranged on a surface that permits many tests or assays to be performed in parallel we assemble our arrays using relatively inexpensive materials our proprietary manufacturing process allows us to easily adapt the arrays to a broad range of applications including both genotyping and gene expression these characteristics allow us to create nextgeneration arrays with a unique combination of high throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility in addition our complementary oligator technology permits parallel synthesis of the millions of different pieces of dna necessary to perform largescale genetic analysis on arrays 

  we provide both products and services that utilize our proprietary technologies during 2001 we launched our commercial genotyping service product line which combines our beadarray technology with an automated laboratory information management system or lims controlled process to provide high throughput identification of the most common form of genetic variation known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps we also began the sale of custom synthesized pieces of dna called oligonucleotides or oligos using our proprietary oligator technology 

  in 2002 we announced the launch of our productionscale beadlab this integrated turnkey system is built around our proprietary beadarray technology included in the system are the beadarray reader goldengate assay protocols lims and analytical software fluidhandling robotics and access to sentrix arrays and our reagent kits for analyzing genetic sequences our sentrix array matrix is a collection of individual arrays arranged in an array of arrays pattern compatible with standard microtiter plates our reagent kit uses highly multiplexed goldengate assay protocols which allow up to 1536 snps to be analyzed at one time in a sample and our beadarray reader is a proprietary scanner used to read the results of the experiments captured on our arrays when installed the beadlab is able to routinely produce up to 14 million genotypes per day 

  also in 2002 we were named the largest us participant in the 100 million first phase of the international hapmap project funded by the national institutes of health this project is an internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that is creating a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform diseaserelated research this map of the human genome will allow more rapid and efficient largescale genetic association studies aimed at discovering variants contributing to human disease and differential response to drug treatments we are one of five funded first phase us participants in a worldwide initiative that includes research groups in canada china japan nigeria and the united kingdom we are directly responsible for screening over 15 of the assays in the first phase of this project this effort leverages our oligator dna synthesis capability and the productionscale throughput of our genotyping services operation our beadlab is being used by organizations responsible for creating over 60 of the assays in the first phase of this project which we expect to be completed in early 2005 

  in early 2003 we completed the installation of and recorded revenue for our first beadlab and as of january 2 2005 we have installed nine beadlabs 

  in 2003 we announced the launch of several new products including 1 a new array format the sentrix beadchip which significantly expands market opportunities for our beadarray technology and provides increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers 2 a gene expression product line on both the sentrix array matrix and the sentrix beadchip that allows researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to 96 samples on a single array and 3 a benchtop snp genotyping and gene expression system the beadstation for performing moderatescale genotyping and gene expression using our technology the beadstation includes our beadarray reader analysis software and assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs sales of these products began in early 2004 and as of january 2 2005 we have shipped 42 beadstations 

3   in 2004 we announced the launch of new sentrix beadchips for wholegenome gene expression and wholegenome genotyping the wholegenome gene expression beadchips are designed to enable highperformance costeffective wholegenome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of wholegenome expression analysis while allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of largescale biological experimentation the wholegenome genotyping beadchip can be scaled to unlimited levels of multiplexing without compromising data quality and will provide scientists the ability to query in parallel a highvalue set of over 100000 snps in 2004 we also announced two new versions of the sentrix array matrix designed for researchers who want to take advantage of our technology but whose projects require fewer snps per sample than the number utilized on our standard 1536plex array products 

  in late 2004 we announced a strategic collaboration with invitrogen corporation to synthesize and distribute oligos under the agreement we intend to expand our oligator dna synthesis technology and invitrogen will be responsible for sales marketing and technical support profits from sales of collaboration products will be divided equally between the two companies 

  in early 2005 we expanded our gene expression portfolio by announcing the launch of a new assay dasl for generating gene expression profiles from rna samples including those containing partially degraded rnas we also announced a standard dasl cancer panel prior to our dasl assay degraded rna samples have been reliably assayed only with expensive lowmultiplex approaches 

  in february 2005 we signed a definitive agreement and plan of merger with cyvera corporation a privatelyheld connecticutbased company pursuant to which cyvera will become a whollyowned subsidiary of illumina cyvera’s digitalmicrobead platform is highly complementary to our portfolio of products and services and upon closing of the transaction will become an integral part of our beadarray technology the acquisition is expected to provide us with a comprehensive approach to beadbased assays for biomarker rd and invitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities including those that require lowcomplexity as well as highcomplexity testing the aggregate consideration for the transaction is 175 million consisting of approximately 15 million shares of illumina common stock and the payment of approximately 23 million of cyvera’s liabilities at the closing the closing is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to occur by the end of march 2005 we expect the first products based on cyvera’s technology to be available in the second half in 2006 

  we are seeking to expand our customer base for our beadarray technology however we can give no assurance that our sales efforts will continue to be successful 

  we were incorporated in california in april 1998 we reincorporated in delaware in july 2000 our principal executive offices are located at 9885 towne centre drive san diego california 92121 our telephone number is 858 2024500 

industry background 

   every person inherits two copies of each gene one from each parent the two copies of each gene may be identical or they may be different these differences are referred to as genetic variation examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color genetic variation can also have important medical consequences including predisposition to disease and differential response to drugs genetic variation affects diseases including cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease in addition genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug some people may respond well others may not respond at all and still others may experience adverse side effects the most common form of genetic variation is a single nucleotide polymorphism or snp a snp is a variation in a single position in a dna sequence it is estimated that the human genome contains between three and six million snps 

4   while in some cases a single snp will be responsible for medically important effects it is now believed that the genetic component of most major diseases is the result of the interaction of many snps therefore it is important to investigate many snps together in order to discover medically valuable information 

  current efforts to understand genetic variation and function have primarily centered around snp genotyping and gene expression profiling 

   snp genotyping is the process of determining which snps are present in each of the two copies of a gene or other portion of dna sequence within an individual or other organism the use of snp genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual snp or a collection of snps and to apply that information to clinical trials and diagnostic testing requires the analysis of millions of snp genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease for example a single large clinical trial could involve genotyping 200000 snps per patient in 1000 patients thus requiring 200 million assays using previously available technologies this scale of snp genotyping was both impractical and prohibitively expensive 

  largescale snp genotyping will be used for a variety of applications including genomicsbased drug development clinical trial analysis disease predisposition testing and disease diagnosis snp genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare for example in the development of plants and animals with desirable commercial characteristics these markets will require billions of snp genotyping assays annually 

   gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mrna the intermediary between genes and proteins variation in gene expression can cause disease or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease by comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different environments such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified studies of this type used in drug discovery require monitoring thousands and preferably tens of thousands of mrnas in large numbers of samples once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples for example within a clinical trial the high cost of current gene expression methods has limited the development of the gene expression market 

  as gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more costeffective technologies

   we have developed a proprietary array technology that enables the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously our beadarray technology provides a unique combination of high throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility we achieve high throughput with a high density of test sites per array and our ability to format arrays in either a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various configurations in the format of standard microscope slides we maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples and from the low manufacturing costs associated with our technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools or sensors for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments we believe that these features have enabled our beadarray technology to become a leading platform for the emerging highgrowth market of snp genotyping and expect they will enable us to become a key player in the gene expression market 

  our proprietary beadarray technology combines microwells etched into a substrate and specially prepared beads that selfassemble into an array we have deployed our beadarray technology in two different sentrix array formats the array matrix and the beadchip our first beadbased product was the array matrix which incorporates fiber optic bundles we have the fiber optic bundles manufactured to our specifications which we cut into lengths of less than one inch each bundle contains approximately 50000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an aluminum plate which forms an array matrix beadchips are fabricated in microscope slideshaped sizes with varying numbers of sample sites per slide both formats are chemically etched to create tens of thousands of wells for each sample site 

  in a separate process we create sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make different batches of beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor for example we create a batch of snp sensors by attaching a particular dna sequence to each bead in the batch we combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to create a bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce thousands of arrays one of the advantages of this technology is that it allows us to create universal arrays for snp genotyping and by varying the reagent kit still be able to use the array to test for any combination of snps 

  to form an array a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells one bead per well the tens of thousands of beads in the wells comprise our individual arrays because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called decoding in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we employ several proprietary methods for decoding a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by having multiple copies of each bead type this improves the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads 

6   an experiment is performed on the array matrix by preparing a sample such as dna from a patient and introducing it to the array the design features of our array matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution containing the sample whereas our beadchip allows processing of samples on a slide the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated bead the beadarray reader detects the matched molecules by shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the beadchip since the molecules in the sample have a structure that causes them to emit light in response to a laser detection of a binding event is possible this allows the measurement of the number of molecules bound to each coated bead resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

   genomic applications require many different short pieces of dna that can be made synthetically called oligonucleotides for example snp genotyping typically requires three to four different oligonucleotides per assay a snp genotyping experiment analyzing 10000 snps may therefore require 30000 to 40000 different oligonucleotides contributing significantly to the expense of the experiment 

  we have designed our proprietary oligator technology for the parallel synthesis of many different oligonucleotides to meet the requirements of largescale genomics applications we believe that our oligator technology is substantially more cost effective and provides higher throughput than available commercial alternatives our synthesis machines are computer controlled and utilize many robotic processes to minimize the amount of labor used in the manufacturing process each of these synthesizers can produce up to 3072 oligos in parallel using very small amounts of material we believe both of these attributes are substantial improvements over other existing technologies in 2005 we intend to implement fourthgeneration oligator technology which will further expand our production capabilities and extend our technology into tubebased oligo products 

   we believe that our beadarray and oligator technologies provide distinct advantages in a variety of applications over competing technologies by creating costeffective highly miniaturized arrays with the following advantages 

  high throughput the miniaturization of our beadarray technology provides significantly greater information content per unit area than any other array known to us to further increase throughput we have formatted our arrays in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates allowing throughput levels of up to 150000 unique assays per microtiter plate as well as the use of laboratory robotics to speed process time the oligator’s parallel synthesis capability allows us to manufacture the diversity of oligonucleotides necessary to support largescale genomic applications 

  cost effectiveness our array products substantially reduce the cost of experiments as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances in fiber optics digital imaging and bead chemistry in addition these products require smaller reagent volumes than other array technologies and therefore reduce reagent costs our costeffective oligator technology further reduces reagent costs as well as the cost of coating beads 

  flexibility a wide variety of conventional chemistries are available for attaching different molecules such as dna rna proteins and other chemicals to beads by using beads we are able to take advantage of these chemistries to create a wide variety of sensors which we assemble into arrays using the same proprietary manufacturing process in addition we can have fiber optic bundles and beadchips manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes with wells organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different markets and market segments in combination the use of beads and etched wells provides the flexibility and scalability for our beadarray technology to be tailored to perform many applications in many different market segments from drug discovery to diagnostics our oligator technology allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of oligonucleotides 

7   quality the high density of beads in each array enables us to have multiple copies of each individual bead type we measure the copies simultaneously and combine them into one data point this allows us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population of identical beads which permits the statistical calculation of a more reliable and accurate value for each data point finally the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on every array improving the overall quality of the data 

our strategy 

  our goal is to make our beadarray platforms the industry standard for products and services utilizing array technologies we plan to achieve this by 

 products and services 

  the first implementation of our beadarray technology the sentrix array matrix is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96well microtiter plate each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1500 unique assays therefore one sentrix array matrix can perform nearly 150000 individual assays simultaneously more than any other commercial array system known to us the beadchip introduced in 2003 is fabricated in multiple configurations to support multiple applications and scanning technologies 

  we have provided genotyping services using our proprietary beadarray technology since 2001 in addition we have developed our first genotyping and gene expression products based on this technology these products include disposable sentrix array matrices and beadchips goldengate reagent kits for snp genotyping beadarray reader scanning instruments and an evolving portfolio of custom and standard gene expression products 

   in 2001 we introduced the first commercial application of our beadarray technology by launching our snp genotyping services product line since this launch we have had peak days in which we operated at over two million genotypes per day based on individual samples to our knowledge no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low cost 

  we designed our first consumable beadarray product the sentrix array matrix for snp genotyping the sentrix array matrix uses a universal format that allows it to analyze any set of snps we have also developed reagent kits based on goldengate assay protocols and the beadarray reader a laser scanner which is used to read our array products 

  depending on throughput and automation requirements our customers can select the system configuration to best meet their needs for productionscale throughput our beadlab would be appropriate and for moderatescale throughput our beadstation would be selected our beadlab includes our beadarray reader combined with lims standard operating procedures and analytical software and fluid handling robotics this productionscale system was commercialized in late 2002 and when installed this system can routinely produce up to 14 million genotypes per day 

8   the beadstation a system for performing moderatescale genotyping designed to match the throughput requirements of individual research groups and core labs was commercialized in late 2003 the beadstation includes our beadarray reader and genotyping andor gene expression analysis software our beadstations are fully upgradeable to a full beadlab through various steps that add automation sample preparation equipment and lims capability 

  for use in snp genotyping both the beadlab and beadstation utilize goldengate assay reagents and our array matrices and will soon support a highdensity version of our beadchip the sentrix beadchip allows simultaneous processing of 16 samples and uses identical content as the sentrix array matrix 

  also in 2003 we announced the availability of an assay set for genetic linkage analysis this standard product has been deployed in our genotyping services operation and is also sold to customers who use our snp genotyping systems genetic linkage analysis can help identify chromosomal regions with potential disease associations across a related set of samples 

  in 2004 we announced a new sentrix beadchip for wholegenome genotyping this beadchip will provide scientists the ability to interrogate over 100000 snps located in highvalue genetic regions of the human genome 

   with the addition of application specific accessory kits our productionscale beadlabs and beadstations are capable of performing a growing number of applications including gene expression profiling 

  in 2003 we introduced our focused set gene expression products on both the sentrix array matrix and sentrix beadchip platforms for highthroughput projects our system includes a beadarray reader for imaging sentrix array matrices and beadchips a hybridization chamber and software for data extraction for research projects that require moderate throughput a version of the sentrix beadchip analyzes eight samples in parallel and can be scanned on a portion of the installed base of axon instruments’ genepix tm scanners in addition we have developed standard gene expression products for each of the human mouse and arabidopsis genomes 

  in 2004 we announced the sentrix human6 and humanref8 expression beadchip products both products will allow largescale expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip and are imaged using our beadarray reader the human6 beadchip is designed to analyze six discrete wholehumangenome samples on one chip interrogating in each sample approximately 48000 transcripts from the estimated 30000 genes in the human genome the humanref8 beadchip product analyzes eight samples in parallel against 24000 transcripts from the roughly 22000 genes represented in the consensus refseq database a wellcharacterized wholegenome subset used broadly in genetic analysis we expect that these new gene expression beadchips will dramatically reduce the cost of wholegenome expression analysis allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of largescale biological experimentation 

  in early 2005 we introduced the new dasl assay for generating gene expression profiles from rna samples including formalinfixed paraffinembedded ffpe samples and other samples containing degraded rnas the dasl assay enables researchers to measure rna abundance of over 500 genes in parallel per sample we also released a standard dasl cancer panel it has been estimated that there are over 400 million ffpe tissue samples archived in north america for cancer alone many of these samples represent known clinical outcomes which will yield important information when linked with underlying gene expression profiles to date degraded rna samples have been reliably assayed only with expensive lowmultiplex approaches our dasl assay generates rna profiles at high multiplex and at a low cost per sample as compared to existing technologies 

   the beadarray reader an instrument we developed is a key component of both our productionscale beadlab and our benchtop beadstation this scanning equipment uses a laser to read the results of experiments that are captured on our arrays and was designed to be used in all areas of genetic analysis that use our sentrix array matrices and sentrix beadchips 

   we have put in place an oligonucleotide manufacturing facility that currently has the capability of producing approximately 20 million oligonucleotides per year in addition to their use to coat beads these oligonucleotides are components of the reagent kits for our beadarray products and are used for assay development because our production capacity exceeds our internal needs we began to offer oligonucleotides for sale to high volume users in 2001 we provide oligonucleotides in a wide range of lengths and in several scales with the ability to add many types of modifications we offer a range of quality control options and have implemented a laboratory information management system to control much of the manufacturing process in 2003 we introduced the first standard product offerings in our oligator product line a wholegenome oligonucleotide reference set designed and optimized for spotted gene expression microarrays and in 2004 we introduced a mouse genome oligo set also for use on spotted gene expression arrays we believe our oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins in 2005 in connection with a collaboration agreement with invitrogen corporation we intend to implement fourthgeneration oligator technology which will further expand our production capabilities and extend our technology into tubebased oligo products 

collaboration with invitrogen corporation 

  in december 2004 we entered into a strategic collaboration with invitrogen corporation through this collaboration we intend to expand our oligator dna synthesis technology and combine that capability with invitrogen’s sales marketing and distribution channels under the terms of the agreement invitrogen has agreed to pay us up to 34 million which we plan to invest in our san diego facility to enable implementation of fourthgeneration oligator technology and extend the technology into tubebased oligo products in addition the agreement provides for the transfer of our oligator technology into two invitrogen facilities outside north america profit from the sale of collaboration products will be divided equally between the two companies 

research and development 

  we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize our beadarray and oligator technologies and to support commercialization of the products and services derived from these technologies these efforts include among others 

 10 

   our research and development expenses for the fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 exclusive of charges relating to stock based compensation of 08 million 13 million and 24 million respectively were 211 million 225 million and 268 million respectively we expect research and development expense to increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts 

government grants 

  government grants allow us to fund internal scientific programs and exploratory research we retain ownership of all intellectual property and commercial rights generated during these projects subject to a nonexclusive nontransferable paidup license to practice for or on behalf of the united states inventions made with federal funds this license is retained by the us government as provided by applicable statutes and regulations we do not believe that the retained license will have any impact on our ability to market our products and we do not need government approval with respect to this license in order to enter into collaborations or other relationships with third parties we are the recipient of a grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the first phase of the international hapmap project which is a 1000 million internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform diseaserelated research we could receive up to 91 million of funding for this project which covers basic research activities the development of snp assays and the genotyping to be performed on those assays as of the end of 2004 we had approximately 07 million of funding remaining related to this project which is expected to be received in early 2005 

11 intellectual property 

  we have an extensive patent portfolio including ownership of or exclusive licenses to 29 issued us patents and 76 pending us patent applications including seven allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents some of which derive from a common parent application our issued patents which cover various aspects of our beadarray oligonucleotide synthesis and chemical detection technologies expire between 2011 and 2020 we are seeking to extend this patent protection on our beadarray goldengate oligator sentrix and related technologies we have received or filed counterparts for many of these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries 

  we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our beadarray dasl goldengate sentrix and oligator technologies 

  we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements with third parties which grant us rights to use key aspects of our array technology assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment we have exclusive licenses from tufts university to patents that cover our use of beadarray technology these patents were filed by dr david walt a member of our board of directors the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2010 and 2020 in 2001 we entered into a nonexclusive license agreement with amersham biosciences that covers certain technology contained in our beadarray reader in 2002 we obtained a nonexclusive license from dade behring marburg gmbh that relates to certain components of our goldengate assay we also have additional nonexclusive licenses from various third parties for other components of our products in all cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect 

marketing and distribution 

  our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and agricultural research our potential customers include pharmaceutical biotechnology agrichemical diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic or private research centers the genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will be ultimately driven by among other items 

 12   we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america major european markets japan and singapore in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in markets outside of these areas primarily the pacific rim countries we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products we expect to significantly increase our sales and distribution resources during 2005 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products 

  in late 2004 we entered into a strategic collaboration with invitrogen corporation with a goal of leveraging our strength in oligo synthesis with invitrogen’s extensive sales marketing and distribution channels we expect to transition all responsibility for oligo sales marketing and technical support to invitrogen in 2005 

manufacturing 

  we manufacture our array platforms reagent kits scanning equipment and oligonucleotides inhouse and believe that we currently have the ability to manufacture these in sufficient quantity to meet anticipated internal and external needs we currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our products we intend to continue and may extend the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing process to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best commercial interests 

  during 2001 we moved into a new facility which allowed us to design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific processes and optimize material flow and personnel movement in addition we have implemented information management systems for many of our manufacturing and services operations to manage all aspects of material and sample use we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances 

competition 

  although we expect that our beadarray products and services will provide significant advantages over currently available products and services we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the snp genotyping and gene expression markets these include companies such as aclara biosciences recently acquired by virologic affymetrix agilent amersham biosciences recently acquired by ge corp applied biosystems beckman coulter caliper technologies luminex parallele bioscience perlegen sciences sequenom and third wave technologies many of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we need to address and in some cases a large installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in the future in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over the existing products rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies although we believe that our technology and products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful 

segment and geographic information 

  we operate in one business segment for the development manufacture and commercialization of tools for genetic analysis our operations are treated as one segment as we only report operating results on an aggregate basis to chief operating decision makers of illumina 

13   during 2004 264 million or 52 of our total revenues came from customers outside the united states as compared to 144 million or 51 in 2003 we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenues we have sales support resources in western europe and direct sales offices in japan and singapore in addition we have distributor relationships in various countries in the pacific rim region 

  information about the geographies in which we operate can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements at note 11 “segment information geographic data and significant customers” 

seasonality 

  historically customer purchasing patterns have not shown significant seasonal variation although demand for our products is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year as customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the year 

environmental matters 

  we are dedicated to the protection of our employees and the environment our operations require the use of hazardous materials which subject us to a variety of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations we believe we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations however we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur in addition we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations or the development of new laws and regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 

employees 

  as of january 2 2005 we had a total of 278 employees 60 of whom hold phd degrees and 37 of such phd degreed employees are engaged in fulltime research and development activities none of our employees is represented by a labor union we consider our employee relations to be positive

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend   the following discussion and analysis should be read with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the discussion and analysis in this annual report on form 10k may contain forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans objectives expectations and intentions the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as applying to all related forwardlooking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in “factors affecting operating results” below as well as those discussed elsewhere 

overview 

  illumina inc was incorporated in april 1998 we develop and market nextgeneration tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine a key goal of genomics using our technologies we have developed a comprehensive line of products that are designed to provide the throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics this information is expected to correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states enhancing drug discovery allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients 

  in 2001 we began commercial sale of short pieces of dna or oligos manufactured using our proprietary oligator technology we believe our oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins in 2001 we also initiated our snp genotyping services product line as a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput low cost beadarray technology we have entered into genotyping services contracts with many leading genotyping centers and have been awarded 91 million from the national institutes of health to play a major role in the first phase of the international hapmap project 

21   our productionscale beadlab is based on the system we developed that has been operational in our genotyping service product line since 2001 in addition to our sentrix array matrices it includes the beadarray reader a proprietary scanner that uses a laser to read the results of experiments captured on our arrays as well as the goldengate snp genotyping assay which can analyze up to 1536 snps per dna sample this system is being marketed to a small number of high throughput genotyping users as of january 2 2005 we have installed and recorded revenue for nine beadlabs 

  in 2003 we announced the launch of several new products including 1 a new array format the sentrix beadchip which significantly expands market opportunities for our beadarray technology and provides increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers 2 a gene expression product line on both the sentrix array matrix and the sentrix beadchip that allows researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to 96 samples on a single array and 3 a benchtop snp genotyping and gene expression system the beadstation for performing moderatescale genotyping and gene expression using our technology the beadstation includes our beadarray reader analysis software and assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs sales of these products began in the first quarter of 2004 and as of january 2 2005 we have shipped 42 beadstations 

  in 2004 we announced the launch of new sentrix beadchips for wholegenome gene expression and wholegenome genotyping the wholegenome gene expression beadchips are designed to enable highperformance costeffective wholegenome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of wholegenome expression analysis while allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of largescale biological experimentation the wholegenome genotyping beadchip can be scaled to unlimited levels of multiplexing without compromising data quality and will provide scientists the ability to query hundreds of thousands of snps in parallel in 2004 we also announced two new versions of the sentrix array matrix designed for researchers who want to take advantage of our technology but whose projects require fewer snps per sample than the number utilized on our standard 1536plex array products 

  in late 2004 we announced a strategic collaboration with invitrogen corporation to synthesize and distribute oligos under the agreement we intend to expand our oligator dna synthesis technology to include both plate and tube based capability and invitrogen will be responsible for sales marketing and technical support profits from sales of collaboration products will be divided equally between the two companies 

  in early 2005 we expanded our gene expression portfolio by announcing the launch of a new assay dasl for generating gene expression profiles from rna samples including those containing partially degraded rnas we also announced a standard dasl cancer panel prior to our dasl assay degraded rna samples have been reliably assayed only with expensive lowmultiplex approaches 

  in february 2005 we signed a definitive agreement and plan of merger with cyvera corporation a privatelyheld connecticutbased company pursuant to which cyvera will become a whollyowned subsidiary of illumina cyvera’s digitalmicrobead platform is highly complementary to our portfolio of products and services and upon closing of the transaction will become an integral part of our beadarray technology the acquisition is expected to provide us with a comprehensive approach to beadbased assays for biomarker rd and invitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities including those that require lowcomplexity as well as highcomplexity testing the aggregate consideration for the transaction is 175 million consisting of approximately 15 million shares of illumina common stock and the payment of approximately 23 million of cyvera’s liabilities at the closing the closing is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to occur by the end of march 2005 we expect the first products based on cyvera’s technology to be available in the second half in 2006 

  we are seeking to expand our customer base for our beadarray technology however we can give no assurance that our sales efforts will continue to be successful 

22   our revenues are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and service projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and amount of government grant funding programs the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns approximately 30 of our revenues for the year 2004 resulted from transactions that were funded under the international hapmap project we currently expect that most of the activities under this grant involving the company and its customers will be completed in early 2005 we expect that the planned commercial launch of our whole genome genotyping and gene expression arrays combined with the continued expansion of our existing product lines will offset the loss of revenues funded by the hapmap grant and will drive future revenue growth however any significant delays in the commercial launch of these new products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth in 2005 or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 

  we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception as of january 2 2005 our accumulated deficit was 1237 million and total stockholders’ equity was 723 million these losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services as well as charges of 59 million related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years we will also need to significantly increase our selling general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems other products and services as a result of the expected increase in expenses we will need to increase revenue significantly to achieve profitability 

critical accounting estimates 

   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates assumptions and judgments with respect to the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates 

  our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements certain accounting policies are deemed critical if 1 they require an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur or different estimates that we reasonably could have used would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above 

  we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

   our sales are primarily from two sources product revenue and services revenue product revenue consists of sales of oligonucleotides arrays assay reagents genotyping systems and gene expression systems services revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping services and extended warranty sales as described below significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 

  we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 104 under sab 104 revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

  product delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier or when the customer receives the product depending on the nature of the arrangement and provided no significant obligations remain beadlabs are considered delivered upon shipment installation training and fulfillment of contractually defined acceptance criteria and we need to determine the completion of each of these deliverables before revenue can be recognized genotyping services are considered delivered generally at the time the genotyping data is delivered to the customer we have been awarded 91 million from the national institutes of health to perform genotyping services in connection with the first phase of the international hapmap project a portion of the services related to this project is considered delivered at the time the related costs are incurred while the remainder is considered delivered upon the delivery of genotyping data 

  in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable we ensure there are no refund rights if payment terms are based on future performance we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured we defer revenue recognition until the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment changes in judgments and estimates made in determining whether the criteria of sab 104 have been met might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized 

  sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems include a standard one year warranty we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts which are generally for one or two years upon the expiration of the initial warranty revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates our gross margins could be adversely affected 

  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions emerging issues task force no 0021 “eitf 0021” “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we believe the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

24   a third source of revenue research revenue consists of amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred all revenues are recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 

   we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze customer accounts review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances could be required 

   we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value we must make assumptions about future demand market conditions and the release of new products that will supercede old ones we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components taking into account product life cycle and development plans product expiration and quality issues historical experience and our current inventory levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated additional inventory adjustments could be required 

   we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses if losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a reserve in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” currently we have no such reserves recorded any reserves recorded in the future may change due to new developments in each matter 

recently issued accounting standards 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 123 revised 2004 share based payment sfas 123r which is a revision of fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas 123 this statement supercedes apb opinion 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and amends fasb statement no 95 statement of cash flows generally the approach in sfas 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas 123 however sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative we currently utilize the blackscholes model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees under the pro forma disclosure requirements of fas 123 while sfas 123r permits companies to continue to use such model it also permits the use of a “lattice” model we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options under the adoption for sfas 123r the new standard is effective for periods beginning after june 15 2005 and we expect to adopt sfas 123r on july 4 2005 

25   we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb 25’s intrinsic value method and as such recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant accordingly the adoption of sfas 123r’s fair value method is expected to result in significant noncash charges which will increase our reported operating expenses however it will have no impact on our cash flows the impact of adoption of sfas 123r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the level of sharebased payments granted in the future and the model we choose to use however had we adopted sfas 123r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss under stockbased compensation in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

  to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended january 2 2005 december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 stated as a percentage of total revenue 

 comparison of years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 

  our fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the sunday closest to december 31 with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the sunday closest to march 31 june 30 and september 30 the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 are 53 and 52 weeks respectively 

    revenue for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 was 506 million and 280 million respectively product revenue increased to 405 million in 2004 from 184 million in 2003 the increase resulted almost entirely from sales of consumables used on our beadlabs and beadstations and sales of our benchtop beadstations offset by fewer sales of our productionscale beadlabs in 2003 we had no sales of beadstations and we only began selling consumable products in may 2003 

  service revenue increased to 81 million in 2004 from 65 million in 2003 substantially all of this increase relates to snp genotyping services performed for the international hapmap project we are the recipient of a grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the first phase of the international hapmap project which is a 100 million internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform diseaserelated research we could receive up to 91 million of funding for this project which covers basic research activities the development of snp assays and the genotyping to be performed on those assays we have recognized revenue under this grant of 84 million and as of the end of 2004 we had approximately 07 million of funding remaining related to this project which is expected to be received in early 2005 

  government grants and other research funding decreased to 20 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 32 million for the year ended december 28 2003 primarily due to a decrease in internal research spending for our grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the international hapmap project we expect government grants to decline as a percentage of total revenues 

  to expand revenue in the future we have recently launched a series of new products that we expect to begin selling in 2005 these include a new assay dasl for generating gene expression profiles from rna samples including those containing partially degraded rnas two multisample whole genome gene expression beadchips and a whole genome genotyping beadchip our beadlabs address a limited number of potential high throughput genotyping customers and sales of these systems may decline in 2005 versus 2004 in addition approximately 30 of our revenues for the year 2004 resulted from transactions that were funded under the international hapmap project we expect that most of the activities under this grant involving us and our customers will be completed in early 2005 and that revenue related to this project will decline in 2005 versus 2004 we expect the sales of the new products mentioned above combined with increased sales of beadstations and revenue generated from our collaboration with invitrogen to offset such declines and for overall revenues to increase above 2004 levels however we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these sales efforts 

    cost of product and service revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead packaging and delivery cost costs related to research revenue is included in research and development expense 

  cost of product revenue increased to 116 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 74 million for the year ended december 28 2003 substantially all of this increase was driven by the sales of our beadstations and consumables gross margin on product revenue increased to 71 in the year ended january 2 2005 from 60 for the year ended december 28 2003 due primarily to increased sales of higher margin consumable products as well as efficiencies gained in oligo manufacturing 

  cost of service revenue decreased to 17 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 26 million for the year ended december 28 2003 and gross margin on service revenue increased to 79 in the year ended january 2 2005 from 60 for the year ended december 28 2003 this decrease in cost and increase in gross margin is due primarily to efficiencies gained in snp genotyping services as well as lower costs of oligos used in the genotyping services process 

  we expect product mix will continue to affect our future gross margins and any increase in the proportion of consumable sales to total sales will continue to favorably affect our gross margins however we expect our market will become increasingly price competitive and over the longer term our margins may decline 

    our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design development testing and enhancement of our products we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred research and development expenses decreased 14 million to 211 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 225 million for the year ended december 28 2003 approximately 09 million of the decrease is attributable to personnel related expenses and related lab supplies and the majority of the remaining 05 million is attributable to lower manufacturingrelated resources needed to support research efforts and a decrease in depreciation expense 

  during the year ended january 2 2005 the cost of beadarray technology research activities decreased 04 million as compared to the year ended december 28 2003 the decrease is primarily the result of completing the development of several products that were commercially launched in late 2003 and 2004 such as our beadstation and focused gene set array products 

  research to support our oligator technology platform decreased 10 million in the year ended january 2 2005 as compared to the year ended december 28 2003 in the second quarter of 2003 we implemented additional oligator manufacturing and software enhancements to expand capacity increase throughput and further reduce operating costs in addition as we increase our product sales a smaller portion of our manufacturing resources are now used to support research efforts as compared to the same periods in 2003 

28   we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in the near term due to the allocation to research and development of rent expense from the new lease on our building and increased spending levels for new product development in addition we expect an increase in research and development expenses in connection with our proposed acquisition of cyvera corporation which is expected to close in march 2005 

  stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was 03 million for the year ended january 2 2005 as compared to 13 million for the year ended december 28 2003 

    our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing finance human resources business development and general management as well as professional fees such as expenses for legal and accounting services selling general and administrative expenses increased 62 million to 251 million for the year ended january 2 2005 from 189 million for the year ended december 28 2003 approximately 52 million of the increase is due to higher sales and marketing costs of which 41 million is attributable to personnel related expenses and 07 million is attributable to an increase in facility related expenses approximately 10 million of the increase in selling general and administrative expenses is related to general and administrative costs of which 04 million is related to personnel related expenses and the majority of the remaining 06 million is attributable to expenses associated with sarbanesoxley compliance and our international expansion we expect that our selling general and administrative expenses will accelerate as we expand our staff add sales and marketing infrastructure incur additional costs to support the commercialization and support of an increasing number of products and due to the allocation to selling general and administrative of rent expense from the new lease on our building 

  stock based compensation related to selling general and administrative employees directors and consultants was 05 million for the year ended january 2 2005 as compared to 12 million for the year ended december 28 2003 

    from our inception through july 27 2000 in connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to employees founders and directors we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling 176 million representing the difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated for financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were granted or such restricted stock was sold we recorded this amount as a component of stockholders’ equity and amortize the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock and options 

29   we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for employees founders and directors using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 28 for consultants deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 and is periodically remeasured and expensed in accordance with emerging issues task force no 9618 

  we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of 08 million and 25 million for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 respectively we expect expenses related to stock based compensation to increase significantly beginning in the third quarter of 2005 as we implement the requirements of sfas 123r although the adoption of sfas 123r’s fair value method is expected to result in a significant increase in our reported operating expenses it will have no impact on our cash flows sfas 123r is discussed further in “recently issued accounting standards” above and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

    a 77 million charge was recorded in june 2002 to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a jury verdict in a terminationofemployment lawsuit we appealed the decision and in december 2004 the fourth appellate district court of appeal in san diego california reduced the amount of the award during the appeal process the court required us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case was resolved for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 we recorded 06 million and 08 million respectively as litigation expense for such interest charges as a result of the revised judgment we reduced the 92 million liability on our balance sheet to 59 million and recorded a gain of 33 million as a litigation judgment in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  in 1999 we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems group an operating group of applera corporation under which the companies agreed to jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray technology with applied biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology in conjunction with the agreement applied biosystems agreed to provide us with nonrefundable research and development support of 100 million all of which was provided by december 2001 as of december 28 2003 this amount was recorded on our balance sheet as an advance payment from a former collaborator in december 2002 applied biosystems initiated a patent infringement suit and sought to compel arbitration of an alleged breach of the joint development agreement we initiated a suit in state court seeking to enjoin the arbitration and alleged that applied biosystems had breached the joint development agreement in august 2004 we entered into a settlement and crosslicense agreement with applera as a result of the settlement we removed the 100 million liability from our balance sheet made a payment of 85 million to applera and recorded a gain of 15 million as a litigation settlement 

  30   interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 09 million and 18 million for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 respectively the decrease is due to lower effective interest rates partially offset by higher average cash balances 

    interest and other expense primarily consists of interest expense which was 14 million and 22 million for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 respectively interest expense relates primarily to a 260 million fixed rate loan which was paid off in august 2004 in connection with the sale of our san diego facilities 

  in the year ended january 2 2005 we recorded approximately 150000 in losses due to foreign currency transactions as compared to approximately 5000 in gains for the year ended december 28 2003 estimated foreign income taxes were approximately 135000 and 45000 for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 respectively 

   we incurred net operating losses for the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 and accordingly we did not pay any us federal or state income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain as of january 2 2005 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately 865 million and 391 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 unless previously utilized 

  we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 31 million and 30 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 unless previously utilized 

  our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to section 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code and similar state provisions as a result of changes in our ownership structure these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 

 

  31   revenue for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 was 280 million and 100 million respectively product revenue increased to 184 million in 2003 from 41 million in 2002 the increase resulted almost entirely from the first sales of our beadlab with six systems sold in the year ended december 28 2003 along with sales of consumables that are used on these systems prior to 2003 we had no sales of beadlabs or consumable products snp genotyping service revenue increased to 65 million in 2003 from 33 million in 2002 substantially all of this increase relates to genotyping services performed for the international hapmap project which commenced in 2003 government grants and other research funding increased to 32 million for the year ended december 28 2003 from 26 million for the year ended december 29 2002 due to an increase in the number of grants received 

    cost of product revenue increased to 74 million the year ended december 28 2003 from 18 million for the year ended december 29 2002 substantially all of this increase was driven by the sales of our beadlabs and consumables of which we had none in 2002 gross margin on product revenue increased to 60 in the year ended december 28 2003 from 56 for the year ended december 29 2002 this increase is due primarily to increased sales of higher margin products such as array matrices and assay reagents 

  cost of service revenue increased to 26 million the year ended december 28 2003 from 17 million for the year ended december 29 2002 substantially all of this increase was driven by the higher level of snp genotyping service revenue in 2003 as compared to 2002 gross margin on service revenue increased to 60 in the year ended december 28 2003 from 48 for the year ended december 29 2002 due primarily to efficiencies gained in snp genotyping services 

    research and development expenses decreased 43 million to 225 million for the year ended december 28 2003 from 268 million for the year ended december 29 2002 

  during the year ended december 28 2003 the cost of beadarray technology research activities decreased 38 million as compared to the year ended december 29 2002 the decrease occurred primarily as a result of completing the development of new products launched in 2003 in addition as we completed development efforts and increased our arraydriven product sales a smaller portion of our manufacturing resources was charged to research and development expense in 2003 than in 2002 

  research to support our oligator technology platform decreased 05 million in the year ended december 28 2003 as compared to the year ended december 29 2002 this decline is primarily due to higher development expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2002 for a major upgrade of our oligator technology which resulted in a significant increase in our manufacturing capacity 

  stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was 13 million for the year ended december 28 2003 as compared to 24 million for the year ended december 29 2002 

    selling general and administrative expenses increased 98 million to 189 million for the year ended december 28 2003 from 91 million for the year ended december 29 2002 approximately 44 million of this increase is related to higher legal expenses which is primarily due to legal proceedings regarding the disputes with applied biosystems approximately 41 million of the increase is due to higher sales and marketing costs of which 30 million is attributable to personnel related expenses while the majority of the remaining 11 million is attributable to an increase in facility related expenses during 2003 we significantly expanded our sales and marketing resources to support the direct sale of our new products including establishing additional sales operations in japan and singapore 

  stock based compensation related to selling general and administrative employees directors and consultants was 12 million for the year ended december 28 2003 as compared to 20 million for the year ended december 29 2002 

    in connection with the grant of stock options and sale of restricted common stock to employees founders and directors through july 27 2000 we recorded deferred compensation of approximately 176 million we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation of 25 million and 44 million for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 respectively 

    a 77 million charge was recorded in june 2002 to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a jury verdict in a terminationofemployment lawsuit we appealed the decision and in december 2004 the fourth appellate district court of appeal in san diego california reduced the amount of the award during the appeal process the court required us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case was resolved for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 we recorded 08 million and 04 million respectively as litigation expense for such interest charges 

  33   interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 18 million and 38 million for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 respectively the decrease is due to lower average levels of invested funds and lower effective interest rates 

    interest expense was 22 million and 23 million for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 respectively interest expense relates primarily to a 260 million fixed rate loan related to the purchase of our new facility during the first quarter of 2002 

liquidity and capital resources 

    as of january 2 2005 we had cash cash equivalents and investments including restricted cash and investments of 122 million of approximately 670 million we currently invest our funds in us dollar based investmentgrade corporate and government debt securities with strong credit ratings or short maturity mutual funds providing similar financial returns 

  our operating activities used cash of 196 million in the year ended january 2 2005 as compared to 183 million in the year ended december 28 2003 net cash used in operating activities in the year ended january 2 2005 was primarily the result of a net loss from operations of 62 million the payment of an 85 million legal settlement as described under “litigation judgment settlement net” above a 72 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales and a 20 million increase in other assets primarily for the security deposit for the building lease reduced by noncash charges of 40 million for depreciation and amortization net cash used in operating activities in the year ended december 28 2003 was primarily the result of a net loss from operations of 271 million reduced by noncash charges of 45 million for depreciation and amortization and noncash charges of 25 million for amortization of deferred stock compensation 

  our investing activities provided cash of 570 million in the year ended january 2 2005 as compared to 285 million in the year ended december 28 2003 cash provided in investing activities in the year ended january 2 2005 was due to 407 million in proceeds from the sale of our land and buildings net of fees and 198 million from the sale or maturity of investment securities net of purchases of investment securities used to provide operating funds for our business reduced by 34 million for the purchase of property and equipment cash provided in investing activities in the year ended december 28 2003 was due primarily to 305 million from the sale or maturity of investment securities net of purchases of investment securities used to provide operating funds for our business reduced by 20 million for the purchase of property and equipment 

34   our financing activities provided 49 million in the year ended january 2 2005 as compared to 02 million in the year ended december 28 2003 cash provided in financing activities in the year ended january 2 2005 was due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of common stock including 287 million of net proceeds from the sale of approximately 46 million shares of our common stock in may 2004 offset by the 252 million in long term debt we paid off in connection with the sale of our land and buildings cash provided in financing activities in the year ended december 28 2003 was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock reduced by payments on longterm debt and equipment financings 

  in june 2002 we recorded a 77 million charge to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit as a result of our decision to appeal the ruling we filed a surety bond with the court in october 2002 of 15 times the judgment amount or approximately 113 million under the terms of the bond we were required to maintain a letter of credit for 90 of the bond amount to secure the bond further we were required to deposit approximately 125 million of marketable securities as collateral for the letter of credit and accordingly these funds were restricted from use for corporate purposes a judgment was rendered in december 2004 and a 59 million payment was made in early 2005 at which time the restricted funds were released 

  as of january 2 2005 we had funding remaining under existing nih grants of approximately 15 million including 07 million available under the international hapmap project all of these amounts are expected to be paid in 2005 subject to the actual amount of activities we perform under these grants 

  based on our current operating plans we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents investments revenues from sales and funding from grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs for at least 24 months operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures at the current time we have no material commitments for capital expenditures however our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully commercialize our snp genotyping and gene expression systems and extensions to those products and to expand our oligonucleotide and snp genotyping services product lines scientific progress in our research and development programs the magnitude of those programs competing technological and market developments the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with affymetrix the success of our collaboration with invitrogen and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings therefore we may require additional funding within this 24 month time frame in addition we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations such as an acquisition even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans further any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights 

  in december 2003 we filed a shelf registration statement that would allow us to raise up to 65 million of funding through the sale of common stock in one or more transactions in may 2004 we raised approximately 287 million net of offering expenses through the sale of our common stock under this shelf registration statement we currently do not have plans to raise additional funds under this registration statement 

   we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities “spes” which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of january 2 2005 we are not involved in any spe transactions 

35   in january 2002 we purchased two newly constructed buildings and assumed a 260 million 10year mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 836 in june 2004 we entered into a conditional agreement to sell our land and buildings for 420 million and to lease back such property for an initial term of ten years the sale was completed in august 2004 at which time the lease was signed after the repayment of the remaining 252 million debt and other related transaction expenses we received 155 million in net cash proceeds we removed the land and net book value of the buildings of 369 million from our balance sheet and are recording the resulting 37 million gain on the sale of the property over the ten year lease term in accordance with sfas 13 accounting for leases under the terms of the lease we made a 19 million security deposit and are paying monthly rent of 318643 for the first year with an annual increase of 3 in each subsequent year 

  we also lease office space under noncancelable operating leases that expire at various times through january 2007 these leases contain renewal options ranging from 2 to 3 years 

  as of january 2 2005 our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations are in thousands 

   the above table does not include orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding 

factors affecting our operating results 

  our business is subject to various risks including those described below in addition to the other information included in this form 10k the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

   our commercial success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property while we recently settled our litigation with applera corporation’s applied biosystems group in august 2004 affymetrix filed a complaint against us in july 2004 alleging infringement of six of its patents and other third parties have or may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization as we enter new markets we expect that competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets in addition third parties have or may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims we may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing our patents against others furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to further develop commercialize and sell products and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost or at all in that event we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could prevent us from commercializing available products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain profitability 

   we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and function and other applications using technologies such as twodimensional electrophoresis capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry flow cytometry microfluidics and mechanically deposited inkjet and photolithographic arrays we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards changes in customer needs emerging competition new product introductions and strong price competition for example affymetrix recently released a 100k snp genotyping chip and has announced a 500k chip which will compete with our snp genotyping service and product offerings and several competitors have begun selling a single chip for whole human genome expression which may compete with our gene expression product offerings one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we have furthermore the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could develop competing products if we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

   we have incurred net losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur net losses at least through early 2005 at january 2 2005 our accumulated deficit was approximately 1237 million and we incurred a net loss of 62 million for the year ended january 2 2005 the magnitude of our net losses will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses we expect to continue incurring significant expenses for research and development for developing our manufacturing capabilities and for sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products in addition we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the launch of new products as a result we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we grow and consequently we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability even if we achieve profitability we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 

   we may not possess all of the resources capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all the products or services that may result from our technologies sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems only began in 2003 and some of our other technologies are in the early stages of commercialization or are still in development you should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting similarly situated companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries we must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale and we currently have fewer resources available for research and development activities than many of our competitors we may not be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner or at all or they may not meet customer requirements or be of sufficient quality or price that enables us to compete effectively in the marketplace problems frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and relatively unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services in addition we may need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of our products or services 

  historically life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a variety of technologies in order to be successful our products must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function 

  market acceptance will depend on many factors including 

 38 

   our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad these problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights 

  the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries including our patent position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we will apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies also our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace 

  we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants nevertheless employees collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets in addition others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 

   we have limited experience manufacturing our products in the volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales we have only recently begun manufacturing products on a commercialscale and in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to launch or sell these products or to produce them economically may prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

   we currently have fewer resources available for sales and marketing and technical support services as compared to our primary competitors and have only recently established a small direct sales force and customer support team in order to effectively commercialize our genotyping and gene expression systems and other products to follow we will need to expand our sales marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services in addition we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place and the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business 

   we currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use if a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services 

   the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources for example we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles and beadchip slides included in our products from single vendors if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components we will be unable to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 

   we expect to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans which will place a strain on our human and capital resources if we are unable to manage this growth effectively our losses could increase our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 

   our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and services the need for capital expenditures to support and expand our business the progress and scope of our research and development projects the filing prosecution and enforcement of patent claims the outcome of our legal proceedings with affymetrix and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for at least 24 months however we premise this expectation on our current operating plan which may change as a result of many factors consequently we may need additional funding within this timeframe our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts in addition we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations such as an acquisition even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 

  we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital available as of january 2 2005 to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 

   we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer david barker our vice president and chief scientific officer and john stuelpnagel our senior vice president and chief operating officer the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives in addition timothy kish our chief financial officer has informed us of his intention to resign in the second quarter of 2005 mr kish continues in his role as chief financial officer and we are currently conducting a search for his successor we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies 

  our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies including the life sciences and healthcare industries thus we will need to add new personnel including management and develop the expertise of existing management the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 

   we have recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire cyvera corporation and may in the future acquire technology products or businesses related to our current or future business our acquisition of cyvera is expected to close in march 2005 however the closing is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions and we cannot assure you this transaction will close in this timeframe or at all we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions further these potential acquisitions entail risks uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business for example we may not be able to successfully integrate a company’s operations technologies products and services information systems and personnel into our business an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial controls and divert management’s attention away from our other business concerns in connection with the cyvera acquisition we will assume certain liabilities and hire certain employees of cyvera which is expected to result in an increase in research and development expenses there may also be unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with an acquisition that could adversely affect our operating results 

   approximately 52 of our revenues for the year ended january 2 2005 were derived from customers outside the united states we intend to continue to expand our international presence and export sales to international customers and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow export sales entail a variety of risks including 

   in addition sales to international customers typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection we are also subject to general geopolitical risks such as political social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

   we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and function namely snp genotyping and gene expression profiling both of these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and function if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 

   our revenues are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of highvalue products and services projects the impact of seasonal spending patterns the timing and amount of government grant funding programs the timing and size of research projects our customers perform changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly accordingly if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to reduce our operating losses approximately 30 of our revenues for the year 2004 resulted from transactions that were funded under the international hapmap project we currently expect that most of the activities under this grant involving the company and its customers will be completed in early 2005 although we expect that the loss of revenues resulting from the completion of the hapmap grant may be offset by the planned commercial launch of our whole genome genotyping and gene expression arrays combined with the continued expansion of our existing product lines any significant delays in the commercial launch of these products unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth in 2005 or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price probably would decline

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate sensitivity 

  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio and a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 

   although most of our revenue is realized in us dollars some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local currencies accordingly the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 

43   exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in operations in july 2004 we began hedging significant foreign currency firm sales commitments and accounts receivable with forward contracts we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes our forward exchange contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly to the extent effective any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported in other comprehensive income realized gains and losses for the effective portion are recognized with the underlying hedge transaction the notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at january 2 2005 was approximately 40 million these contracts had a fair value of approximately 02 million representing an unrealized loss and were included in other current liabilities at january 2 2005 as of january 2 2005 all contracts were set to expire at various times through july 29 2005 and are with reputable bank institutions for the year ended january 2 2005 there were no amounts recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness and we settled foreign exchange contracts of approximately 03 million we have hedged all significant firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and as a result any increase or decrease in the exchange rates of these commitments would have no net effect to our balance sheet or our results of operations

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   we have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that we record process summarize and report information we are required to disclose in our periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission in the manner and within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms we also design our disclosure controls to ensure that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure we also maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and our established financial policies we design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that 1 our transactions are properly authorized 2 our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use and 3 our transactions are properly recorded and reported in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

44   we have evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether they are effective in ensuring that the disclosure of required information is timely made in accordance with the exchange act and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission this evaluation was made under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as of january 2 2005 our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

  the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded based on their review that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined by exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms in addition no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting has occurred during the fourth quarter of 2004 

   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

  we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control — integrated framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 2 2005 

  our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2005 has been audited by ernst  young llp independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included on page f3 herein

 item 1 business tableend overview   we are a leading developer of nextgeneration tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine a key goal of genomics our tools provide information that could be used to improve drugs and therapies customize diagnoses and treatment and cure disease   completion of the sequencing of the human genome will drive demand for tools that can assist researchers in processing the billions of tests necessary to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information this requires functional analysis of highly complex biological systems involving a scale of experimentation not practical using currently available tools and technologies using our technologies we have developed a comprehensive line of products that can address the scale of experimentation and the breadth of functional analysis required to help achieve the goals of molecular medicine   our patented beadarray technology uses microscopic beads randomly deposited in wells to achieve a level of miniaturization that allows for a new scale of experimentation a microarray is a collection of miniaturized test sites arranged on a surface that permits many tests or assays to be performed in parallel our arrays allow simultaneous processing of many samples in parallel achieving throughput we believe to be significantly beyond the capability of any other technology currently on the market we assemble our arrays using relatively inexpensive materials our proprietary manufacturing process allows us to easily adapt the arrays to a broad range of applications including both genotyping and gene expression these characteristics allow us to create nextgeneration arrays with a unique combination of high throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility in addition our complemen 2 tary oligator technology permits parallel synthesis of the millions of different pieces of dna necessary to perform largescale genetic analysis on arrays 

  we provide both products and services that utilize our proprietary technologies during 2001 we launched our commercial genotyping service product line which combines our beadarray technology with an automated laboratory information management system or lims controlled process to provide high throughput identification of the most common form of genetic variation known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps we also began the sale of custom synthesized pieces of dna called oligonucleotides or oligos using our proprietary oligator technology   in the third quarter of 2002 we announced the launch of our production scale beadlab genotyping system this integrated turnkey system is built around our proprietary beadarray technology included in the system are the beadarray reader goldengate assay protocols lims and analytical software fluidhandling robotics and access to sentrix arrays and reagent kits for analyzing genetic sequences our sentrix array is a collection of individual arrays arranged in a pattern compatible with standard microtiter plates our reagent kit uses highly multiplexed goldengate assay protocols which allow up to 1536 snps to be analyzed at one time in a sample and our beadarray reader is a proprietary scanner used to read the results of the experiments captured on our arrays our genotyping system is based on the production laboratory that has been operational in our genotyping service product line since 2001 when installed the beadlab genotyping system is able to routinely produce up to 14 million genotypes per day as of the end of february 2004 we have installed six beadlab genotyping systems   in the fourth quarter of 2002 we were named the largest us participant in the 100 million international hapmap project funded by the national institutes of health this project is an internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform diseaserelated research this map of the human genome will allow more rapid and efficient largescale genetic association studies aimed at discovering variants contributing to human disease and differential response to drug treatments we are one of five funded us participants in a worldwide initiative that includes research groups in canada china japan nigeria and the united kingdom we will be directly responsible for screening over 15 of the assays in the project this effort leverages our oligator dna synthesis capability and the productionscale throughput of our genotyping services operation our beadlab system is being used by organizations responsible for creating over 60 of the assays in this project   in the first quarter of 2003 we completed the installation of and recorded revenue for our first beadlab highthroughput snp genotyping system we installed and recorded revenue for a second beadlab in the second quarter of 2003 two additional beadlabs in the third quarter of 2003 and a fifth and sixth beadlab system in the fourth quarter of 2003   in the second quarter of 2003 we announced the launch of a new microarray format the sentrix beadchip which is expected to significantly expand market opportunities for our beadarray technology and provide increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers   in the third quarter of 2003 we announced the launch of a gene expression product line on both the sentrix array matrix and the sentrix beadchip that will allow researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to 96 samples on a single microarray   in the fourth quarter of 2003 we announced the launch of a benchtop snp genotyping system the beadstation for performing medium scale genotyping using our technology the beadstation includes our beadarray reader genotyping analysis software and goldengate assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs this system is expected to be available for shipment in the second quarter of 2004   in the first quarter of 2004 we announced the launch of two new sentrix beadchips for wholegenome gene expression these beadchips are designed to enable highperformance costeffective 3 wholegenome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of wholegenome expression analysis while allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of largescale biological experimentation 

  we are seeking to expand our customer base for our beadarray technology however we can give no assurance that our sales efforts will continue to be successful   we were incorporated in california in april 1998 we reincorporated in delaware in july 2000 our principal executive offices are located at 9885 towne centre drive san diego california 92121 our telephone number is 858 2024500 industry background 

 

   every person inherits two copies of each gene one from each parent the two copies of each gene may be identical or they may be different these differences are referred to as genetic variation examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color genetic variation can also have important medical consequences including predisposition to disease and differential response to drugs genetic variation affects diseases including cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease in addition genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug some people may respond well others may not respond at all and still others may experience adverse side effects the most common form of genetic variation is a single nucleotide polymorphism or snp a snp is a variation in a single position in a dna sequence it is estimated that the human genome contains between three and six million snps   while in some cases a single snp will be responsible for medically important effects it is now believed that the genetic component of most major diseases is the result of the interaction of many snps therefore it will be important to investigate many snps together in order to discover medically valuable information   current efforts to understand genetic variation and function have primarily centered around snp genotyping and gene expression profiling 

 

   snp genotyping is the process of determining which snps are present in each of the two copies of a gene or other portion of dna sequence within an individual or other organism the use of snp genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual snp or a collection of snps and to apply that information to clinical trials and diagnostic testing will require the analysis of millions of snp genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease for example a single large clinical trial could involve genotyping 200000 snps per patient in 1000 patients thus requiring 200 million assays using available technologies this scale of snp genotyping is both impractical and prohibitively expensive   largescale snp genotyping will be used for a variety of applications including genomicsbased drug development clinical trial analysis disease predisposition testing and disease diagnosis snp genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare for example in the development of plants and animals with desirable commercial characteristics these markets will require billions of snp genotyping assays annually 

 

   gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mrna the intermediary between genes and proteins variation in gene expression can cause disease or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease by comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different 4 environments such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified studies of this type used in drug discovery require monitoring thousands and preferably tens of thousands of mrnas in large numbers of samples once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples for example within a clinical trial the high cost of current gene expression methods has limited the development of the gene expression market 

  once gene expression patterns have been correlated to specific diseases gene expression profiling is expected to become an important diagnostic tool diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more costeffective technologies our technologies 

 

   we have developed a proprietary array technology that enables the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function our beadarray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously our beadarray technology provides a unique combination of high throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility we achieve high throughput with a high density of test sites per array and our ability to format arrays in either a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various configurations in the format of standard microscope slides we maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples and from the low manufacturing costs associated with our complementary technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific bead pools or sensors for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments we believe that these features will enable our beadarray technology to become a leading platform for the emerging highgrowth markets of snp genotyping and gene expression   our proprietary beadarray technology combines microwells etched into a substrate and specially prepared beads that selfassemble into an array we have deployed our beadarray technology in two different formats the array matrix and the beadchip our first beadbased product was the array matrix which incorporates fiber optic bundles we have the fiber optic bundles manufactured to our specifications which we cut into lengths of less than one inch each bundle contains approximately 50000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an aluminum plate which forms an array matrix beadchips are fabricated in microscope slideshaped sizes with varying numbers of sample sites per slide both formats are chemically etched to create tens of thousands of wells for each sample site   in a separate process we create sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make different batches of beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor for example we create a batch of snp sensors by attaching a particular dna sequence to each bead in the batch we combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to create a bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce thousands of arrays one of the advantages of this technology is that it allows us to create universal arrays for snp genotyping all of our snp genotyping arrays are manufactured with the same set of sensors this allows us to manufacture one type of genotyping array and by varying the reagent kit still be able to use it to test for any combination of snps   to form an array a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells one bead per well the tens of thousands of beads in the wells comprise our beadarray because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called decoding in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we 5 employ several proprietary methods for decoding a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by having multiple copies of each bead type this improves the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads 

  one performs an experiment on the beadarray matrices by preparing a sample such as dna from a patient and introducing it to the array the design features of our array matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution containing the sample whereas our beadchip allows processing of samples on a slide the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated bead the beadarray reader detects the matched molecules by shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the beadchip since the molecules in the sample have a structure that causes them to emit light in response to a laser detection of a binding event is possible this allows the measurement of the number of molecules bound to each coated bead resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

 

   genomic applications require many different short pieces of dna that can be made synthetically called oligonucleotides for example snp genotyping typically requires three to four different oligonucleotides per assay a snp genotyping experiment analyzing 10000 snps may therefore require 30000 to 40000 different oligonucleotides contributing significantly to the expense of the experiment   we have designed our proprietary oligator technology for the parallel synthesis of many different oligonucleotides to meet the requirements of largescale genomics applications we believe that our oligator technology is substantially more cost effective and provides higher throughput than available commercial alternatives our synthesis machines are computer controlled and utilize many robotic processes to minimize the amount of labor used in the manufacturing process each of these synthesizers can produce up to 3072 oligos in parallel using very small amounts of material we believe both of these attributes are substantial improvements over other existing technologies 

 

   we believe that our beadarray and oligator technologies provide distinct advantages in a variety of applications over competing technologies by creating costeffective highly miniaturized arrays with the following advantages   high throughput the miniaturization of our beadarray technology provides significantly greater information content per unit area than any other array known to us to further increase throughput we have formatted our arrays in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates allowing throughput levels of up to 150000 unique assays per microtiter plate as well as the use of laboratory robotics to speed process time the oligator’s parallel synthesis capability allows us to manufacture the diversity of oligonucleotides necessary to support largescale genomic applications   cost effectiveness our beadarray products substantially reduce the cost of experiments as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances in fiber optics digital imaging and bead chemistry in addition these products require smaller reagent volumes than other array technologies and therefore reduce reagent costs our costeffective oligator technology further reduces reagent costs as well as the cost of coating beads   flexibility a wide variety of conventional chemistries are available for attaching different molecules such as dna rna proteins and other chemicals to beads by using beads we are able to take advantage of these chemistries to create a wide variety of sensors which we assemble into arrays using the same proprietary manufacturing process in addition we can have fiber optic bundles and 6 beadchips manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes with wells organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different markets and market segments in combination the use of beads and etched wells provides the flexibility and scalability for our beadarray technology to be tailored to perform many applications in many different market segments from drug discovery to diagnostics our oligator technology allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of oligonucleotides 

  quality the high density of beads in each array enables us to have multiple copies of each individual bead type we measure the copies simultaneously and combine them into one data point this allows us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population of identical beads which permits the statistical calculation of a more reliable and accurate value for each data point finally the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on every array improving the overall quality of the data our strategy   our goal is to make our beadarray platforms the industry standard for products and services utilizing array technologies we plan to achieve this by  products and services   the first implementation of our beadarray technology the sentrix array matrix is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96well microtiter plate each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1500 unique assays therefore one sentrix array can perform nearly 150000 individual assays simultaneously more than any other array system known to us the beadchip introduced in 2003 is fabricated in multiple configurations to support multiple applications and scanning technologies   we have provided genotyping services using our proprietary beadarray technology since 2001 in addition we have developed our first genotyping and gene expression products based on this technology these products include disposable sentrix arrays and beadchips goldengate reagent kits for snp genotyping and beadarray reader scanning instruments 

 

   in 2001 we introduced the first commercial application of our beadarray technology by launching our snp genotyping services product line since this launch we have had peak days in which we operated at two million genotypes per day based on individual samples to our knowledge no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low cost   we designed our first consumable beadarray product the sentrix array matrix for snp genotyping the sentrix array matrix uses a universal format that allows it to analyze any set of snps we have also developed reagent kits based on goldengate assay protocols and the beadarray reader a laser scanner which is used to read our array products these components combined with lims standard operating procedures and analytical software and fluid handling robotics comprise our beadlab snp genotyping system this production scale system was commercialized in late 2002 and when installed the genotyping system can routinely produce up to 14 million genotypes per day 7   in january 2003 we announced the availability of two assay sets one for genetic linkage analysis and the other for fine chromosomal or wholegenome mapping these standard products have been deployed in our genotyping services operation and are also sold to customers who use our snp genotyping system genetic linkage analysis can help identify chromosomal regions with potential disease associations across a related set of samples fine mapping provides dense genotyping and may enable target gene identification related to a specific disease   in november 2003 we announced the beadstation a system for performing moderate scale genotyping designed to match the throughput requirements of individual research groups and core labs the beadstation includes our beadarray reader genotyping analysis software and goldengate assay reagents and will initially support a highdensity version of our beadchip the sentrix beadchip allows simultaneous processing of 16 samples and uses identical content as the sentrix array matrix 

 

   in september 2003 we introduced our focused set gene expression products on both the sentrix array matrix and sentrix beadchip platforms for highthroughput projects our system includes a beadarray reader for imaging sentrix array matrices a hybridization chamber and software for data extraction for research projects that require moderate throughput a version of the sentrix beadchip analyzes eight samples in parallel and can be scanned on a portion of the installed base of axon instruments’ genepix tm scanners in addition we have developed standard gene expression products for each of the human mouse and arabidopsis genomes   in january 2004 we announced two wholegenome gene expression beadchip products both products allow wholegenome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip and are imaged using our beadarray reader the first beadchip is designed to analyze six discrete wholehumangenome samples on one chip interrogating in each sample approximately 48000 transcripts from the estimated 30000 genes in the human genome the second beadchip product analyzes eight samples in parallel against the roughly 22000 genes represented in the consensus refseq database a wellcharacterized wholegenome subset used broadly in genetic analysis we expect that the new wholegenome gene expression beadchips will dramatically reduce the cost of wholegenome expression analysis allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of largescale biological experimentation 

 

   we have developed the beadarray reader which is an instrument that uses a laser to read the results of experiments that are captured on our sentrix array matrices and beadchips and is part of both our production scale beadlab snp genotyping laboratory and our benchtop beadstation system this scanning equipment was designed to be used in all areas of genetic analysis that use our sentrix arrays 

 

   we have put in place an oligonucleotide manufacturing facility that currently has the capability of producing approximately 20 million oligonucleotides per year in addition to their use to coat beads these oligonucleotides are components of the reagent kits for our beadarray products and are used for assay development because our production capacity exceeds our internal needs we began to offer oligonucleotides for sale to high volume users in 2001 we provide oligonucleotides in a wide range of lengths and in several scales with the ability to add many types of modifications we offer a range of quality control options and have implemented a laboratory information management system to control much of the manufacturing process in february 2003 we introduced the first standard product offerings in our oligator product line a wholegenome oligonucleotide reference set designed and optimized for spotted gene expression microarrays we believe our oligator technology is more cost 8 effective than competing technologies which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins 

partnerships and collaborations   in november 1999 we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems a division of applera corporation under which the companies would jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray tm technology with applied biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology under this agreement we were primarily responsible for developing and manufacturing the arrays and applied biosystems was responsible for developing and manufacturing the instruments snp assay reagents and software and for marketing the system worldwide in conjunction with the agreement applied biosystems purchased 125 million shares of series c convertible preferred stock at 400 per share in addition applied biosystems agreed to provide us with nonrefundable research and development support of 10 million all of which was provided by december 2001 upon commercialization of the system we were to receive a share of the operating profits from the sales of all components of these systems had such sales occurred   in july 2002 applied biosystems indicated that the planned mid2002 launch of this genotyping system would be delayed a second time this delay was related to applied biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the snp assay reagents we do not believe that applied biosystems has any intention of continuing to develop a collaboration product with us as a result of the delay in developing the collaboration product we launched our own productionscale genotyping system in july 2002 utilizing our arrays and an independently developed scanner and assay method in december 2002 we announced that we had notified applied biosystems that it was in breach of the joint development agreement this notification followed a patent infringement suit filed by applied biosystems against us and a notification from applied biosystems alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to the agreement in december 2003 we notified applied biosystems that we had terminated the joint development agreement for further information regarding this matter please see item 3 “legal proceedings” and item 7 “managements’ discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we do not have any other significant partnerships or collaborations research and development   we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize our beadarray and oligator technologies and to support commercialization of the products and services derived from these technologies these efforts include among others  9    our research and development expenses for the fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 exclusive of charges relating to stock based compensation of 13 million 24 million and 31 million respectively were 225 million 268 million and 207 million respectively we expect research and development expense to remain flat in 2004 as compared to 2003 but in general increase in the future as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts government grants   government grants allow us to fund internal scientific programs and exploratory research we retain ownership of all intellectual property and commercial rights generated during these projects subject to a nonexclusive nontransferable paidup license to practice for or on behalf of the united states inventions made with federal funds this license is retained by the us government as provided by applicable statutes and regulations we do not believe that the retained license will have any impact on our ability to market our products and we do not need government approval with respect to this license in order to enter into collaborations or other relationships with third parties we are the recipient of a grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the international hapmap project which is a 100 million internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform diseaserelated research we could receive up to 9 million of funding for this project which covers basic research activities the development of snp assays and the genotyping to be performed on those assays as of the end of 2003 we had approximately 54 million of funding remaining related to this project much of which is expected to be received in 2004 depending on the actual amount of work that is performed by us intellectual property   we have an extensive patent portfolio including ownership of or exclusive licenses to 27 issued us patents and 65 pending us patent applications including four allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents some of which derive from a common parent application our issued patents which cover various aspects of our beadarray oligonucleotide synthesis and chemical detection technologies expire between 2011 and 2020 we are seeking to extend this patent protection on our beadarray goldengate oligator sentrix and related technologies we have received or filed counterparts for many of these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries   we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our beadarray goldengate sentrix and oligator technologies 10   we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements with third parties which grant us rights to use key aspects of our array technology assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment we have exclusive licenses from tufts university to patents that cover our use of beadarray technology these patents were filed by dr david walt a member of our board of directors the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2010 and 2020 in 2001 we entered into a nonexclusive license agreement with amersham biosciences that covers certain technology contained in our beadarray reader in 2002 we obtained a nonexclusive license from dade behring marburg gmbh that relates to certain components of our goldengate assay in all cases the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents may be terminated at our request without further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect marketing and distribution   our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the life sciences market in particular experiments involving snp genotyping and gene expression profiling these experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research including basic human disease research pharmaceutical drug discovery and development pharmacogenomics toxicogenomics and agricultural research our potential customers include pharmaceutical biotechnology agrichemical diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic or private research centers the genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of development will be ultimately driven by among other items    we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america major european markets japan and singapore in each of these areas we have dedicated sales service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases in markets outside of these areas primarily the pacific rim countries we sell our products and provide services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products we expect to significantly increase our sales and distribution resources during 2004 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the number of customers that can use our products manufacturing   we manufacture our array platforms reagent kits scanning equipment and oligonucleotides inhouse and believe that we currently have the ability to manufacture these in sufficient quantity to meet anticipated internal and external needs we currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our products we intend to continue and may extend the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing process to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best commercial interests   during 2001 we moved into a new facility which allowed us to design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific processes and optimize material flow and personnel movement in addition we have implemented information management systems for many of our manufacturing and services operations to manage all aspects of material and sample use we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances 11 competition   although we expect that our beadarray products and services will provide significant advantages over currently available products and services we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the snp genotyping and gene expression markets these include companies such as aclara biosciences affymetrix agilent amersham biosciences recently acquired by ge corp applied biosystems beckman coulter caliper technologies luminex parallele bioscience perlegen sciences sequenom and third wave technologies many of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we need to address and in some cases a large installed base of systems each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in the future in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over the existing products rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies although we believe that our technology and products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful geographic information   during 2003 144 million or 51 of our total revenues came from customers outside the united states as compared to 13 million or 13 in 2002 we expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenues in 2003 we continued to add sales support resources in western europe and opened direct sales offices in japan and singapore in addition we established new distributor relationships in china and australia   information about the geographies in which we operate can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements at note 10 “segment information and geographic data” employees   as of december 28 2003 we had a total of 236 employees 53 of whom hold phd degrees and 103 of whom

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   in march 2001 a complaint seeking damages of an unspecified amount was filed against us by a former employee in the superior court of the state of california in connection with the employee’s termination of employment with illumina in july 2002 a california superior court judgment was rendered against the company and we recorded a 77 million charge in our financial results for the second quarter of 2002 to cover total damages and remaining expenses we believe that the termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was unsupported by evidence presented at the trial a notice of appeal in this case was filed on october 10 2002 and the appeal process is ongoing we are also recording interest expense on the 77 million during the appeal based on the statutory rate   in december 2002 applied biosystems group filed a complaint then later in march 2003 amended and refiled a complaint for a patent infringement suit against us in the federal court in northern california asserting infringement of several patents related to an applied biosystems’ assay intended for use in our collaboration applied biosystems seeks a judgment granting it damages for infringement treble damages alleging that such infringement is willful and a permanent injunction restraining us from the alleged infringement we have answered the complaint asserting various defenses including that we do not infringe the patents or that the patents are invalid and asserting 14 counterclaims against applied biosystems seeking declaratory judgment relief related to the patents being asserted against us and seeking damages from applied biosystems for its unfair and unlawful conduct which constitutes attempted monopolization in violation of the antitrust laws 

  also in december 2002 applied biosystems sent a notification to us alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement between illumina and applied biosystems entered into in november 1999 and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement this notification alleged that our productionscale genotyping products and services are collaboration products developed under the joint development agreement and that our commercial activities with respect to our genotyping products and services are unlawful unfair or fraudulent among other relief applied biosystems is seeking compensatory damages of 30 million disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of these products and services and a prohibition of future sales of these products or services   in december 2002 we filed a suit alleging breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing unfair competition and other allegations against applied biosystems in san diego superior court and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by applied biosystems in december 2003 we notified applied biosystems that we terminated the joint development agreement   in december 2003 after having granted temporary and preliminary injunctions staying the arbitration the san diego superior court directed applied biosystems and us to resolve the contract dispute in a binding arbitration procedure while a definitive schedule has not yet been set we believe that the arbitration process could be completed as early as september 2004 we will vigorously defend against the claims alleged by applied biosystems but the outcome of an arbitration proceeding is inherently uncertain and we cannot be sure that we will prevail this arbitration could result in a range of potential outcomes based solely on the judgment and discretion of the arbitrator including 1 the award of all damages and injunctive relief sought by applied biosystems 2 the award of all damages and relief sought by us or 3 a partial award of damages andor injunctive relief to either party we have not accrued for any potential losses in this case because we believe that an adverse determination is not probable and potential losses cannot be reasonably estimated in addition our financial statements include a 10 million advance payment from applied biosystems that would have been deducted from the profits otherwise payable to us from applied biosystems had the collaboration been successful and which could offset the impact on our consolidated results of operations of an adverse arbitration determination up to that amount however any unfavorable arbitration determination and in particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by the company or prohibition of the sale of our products or services could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   we are in the early stages of proceedings in the patent case in february 2004 the federal district court in northern california ordered that the patent case be stayed pending completion of the arbitration process we intend to vigorously defend against the claims alleged by applied biosystems and continue to pursue our counterclaims against applied biosystems however we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these matters any unfavorable determination and in particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by the company or prohibition of the sale of our products or services could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 15

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend   the following discussion and analysis should be read with “selected financial data” and our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the discussion and analysis in this annual report on form 10k may contain forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans objectives expectations and intentions the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as applying to all related forwardlooking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in “factors affecting operating results” below as well as those discussed elsewhere overview   illumina inc was incorporated in april 1998 we are developing nextgeneration tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine a key goal of genomics using our technologies we have developed a comprehensive line of products that are designed to provide the throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics this information is expected to correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states enhancing drug discovery allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients   in november 1999 we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems under which the companies would jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray technology with applied biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology under this agreement we were primarily responsible for developing and manufacturing the arrays and applied biosystems was primarily responsible for developing and manufacturing the instruments snp assay reagents and software and for marketing the system worldwide in conjunction with the agreement applied biosystems purchased 125 million shares of series c convertible preferred stock at 400 per share in addition applied biosystems agreed to provide us with nonrefundable research and development support of 10 million all of which was provided by december 2001 upon commercialization of the system we would have received a share of the operating profits from the sales of all components of these systems we had originally deferred recognition of revenue from the research funding of 10 million provided by applied biosystems and would have recognized such amounts as revenue at a contractually defined rate of 25 of the total profit share we earned from the sales of 18 collaboration products had such sales occurred as of december 28 2003 this amount has been reclassified to an advance payment from former collaborator 

  in july 2002 applied biosystems indicated that the planned mid2002 launch of this genotyping system would be delayed a second time this delay was related to applied biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the snp assay reagents we do not believe that applied biosystems has any intention of continuing to develop a collaboration product with us and it has recently launched a competing product as a result of the delay in developing the collaboration product we launched our own productionscale genotyping system in july 2002 utilizing our arrays and an independently developed scanner and assay method   in december 2002 applied biosystems filed a complaint then later in march 2003 amended and refiled a complaint for a patent infringement suit against us in the federal court in northern california asserting infringement of several patents related to applied biosystems’ patented assay intended for use in our collaboration applied biosystems seeks a judgment granting it damages for infringement treble damages alleging that such infringement is willful and a permanent injunction restraining us from the alleged infringement we have answered the complaint asserting various defenses including that we do not infringe the patents or that the patents are invalid and asserting counterclaims against applied biosystems seeking declaratory judgment relief related to the patents being asserted against us and seeking damages from applied biosystems for its unfair and unlawful conduct which constitutes attempted monopolization in violation of the antitrust laws   also in december 2002 applied biosystems sent a notification to us alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement entered into in november 1999 and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement this notification alleged that our productionscale genotyping products and services are collaboration products developed under the joint development agreement and that our commercial activities with respect to our genotyping products and services are unlawful unfair or fraudulent among other relief applied biosystems is seeking compensatory damages of 30 million disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of these products and services and a prohibition of future sales of these products or services   in december 2002 we filed a suit alleging breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing unfair competition and other allegations against applied biosystems in san diego superior court and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by applied biosystems in december 2003 we notified applied biosystems that we terminated the joint development agreement   in december 2003 after having granted temporary and preliminary injunctions staying the arbitration the san diego superior court directed applied biosystems and us to resolve the contract dispute in a binding arbitration procedure while a definitive schedule has not yet been set we believe that the arbitration process could be completed as early as september 2004 we will vigorously defend against the claims alleged by applied biosystems but the outcome of an arbitration proceeding is inherently uncertain and we cannot be sure that we will prevail this arbitration could result in a range of potential outcomes based solely on the judgment and discretion of the arbitrator including 1 the award of all damages and injunctive relief sought by applied biosystems 2 the award of all damages and relief sought by us or 3 a partial award of damages andor injunctive relief to either party we have not accrued for any potential losses in this case because we believe that an adverse determination is not probable and potential losses cannot be reasonably estimated in addition our financial statements include a 10 million advance payment from applied biosystems that would have been deducted from the profits otherwise payable to us from applied biosystems had the collaboration been successful and which could offset the impact on our consolidated results of operations of an adverse arbitration determination up to that amount however any unfavorable arbitration determination and in particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by us or prohibition of the sale of our products or services could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 19   we are in the early stages of proceedings in the patent case in february 2004 the federal district court in northern california ordered that the patent case be stayed pending completion of the arbitration process we intend to vigorously defend against the claims alleged by applied biosystems and continue to pursue our counterclaims against applied biosystems however we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these matters any unfavorable determination and in particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by us or prohibition of the sale of our products or services could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   in the first quarter of 2001 we began commercial sale of short pieces of dna or oligos manufactured using our proprietary oligator technology we believe our oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins in the second quarter of 2001 we initiated our snp genotyping services product line as a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput low cost beadarray technology we have entered into genotyping services contracts with many of the leading genotyping organizations including glaxosmithkline and the sanger centre and have been awarded 9 million from the national institutes of health to play a major role in the international hapmap project   our productionscale genotyping system beadlab is based on the system we developed that has been operational in our genotyping service product line since 2001 in addition to our sentrix array matrices it includes the beadarray reader a proprietary scanner that uses a laser to read the results of experiments captured on our arrays as well as the goldengate snp genotyping assay which can analyze up to 1536 snps per dna sample this system is initially being marketed to a small number of high throughput genotyping users   in the first quarter of 2003 we completed the installation of and recorded revenue for our first beadlab highthroughput snp genotyping system we installed and recorded revenue for a second beadlab in the second quarter of 2003 two additional beadlabs in the third quarter of 2003 and a fifth and sixth beadlab system in the fourth quarter of 2003   in the second quarter of 2003 we announced the launch of a new array format the sentrix beadchip which is expected to significantly expand market opportunities for our beadarray technology and provide increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers   in the third quarter of 2003 we announced the launch of a gene expression product line on both the sentrix array matrix and the sentrix beadchip that will allow researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to 96 samples on a single array   in the fourth quarter of 2003 we announced the launch of a benchtop snp genotyping system the beadstation for performing medium scale genotyping using our technology the beadstation includes our beadarray reader genotyping analysis software and goldengate assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs this system is expected to be available for shipment in the second quarter of 2004   in the first quarter of 2004 we announced the launch of two new sentrix beadchips for wholegenome gene expression these beadchips are designed to enable highperformance costeffective wholegenome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of wholegenome expression analysis while allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of largescale biological experimentation   we are seeking to expand our customer base for our beadarray technology however we can give no assurance that our sales efforts will continue to be successful   a significant portion of our current revenue is derived from a few large individual transactions such as the sale of production genotyping systems and large genotyping services contracts including our work on the international hapmap project because these transactions do not occur regularly and 20 there is a lengthy sales cycle for such transactions revenue of these types may not occur on a consistent or frequent basis in addition our total amount of revenues is subject to fluctuations in demand from seasonality impacts the timing and amount of us government grant funding programs the timing and size of research projects our customers perform and changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 

  we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception as of december 28 2003 our accumulated deficit was 1175 million and total stockholders’ equity was 474 million these losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services as well as charges of 88 million related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years we will also need to significantly increase our selling general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems other products and services as a result we will need to increase revenue significantly to achieve profitability results of operations   to enhance comparability the following table sets forth audited consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 28 2003 december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 stated as a percentage of total revenue  21 comparison of years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 

 

    revenue for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 was 280 million and 100 million respectively product revenue increased to 184 million in 2003 from 41 million in 2002 the increase resulted almost entirely from the first sales of our beadlab snp genotyping system with six systems sold in the year ended december 28 2003 along with sales of consumables that are used on these systems prior to 2003 we had no sales of genotyping systems or consumable products snp genotyping service revenue increased to 65 million in 2003 from 33 million in 2002 substantially all of this increase relates to genotyping services performed for the international hapmap project which commenced in 2003 we are the recipient of a grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the international hapmap project which is a 100 million internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform diseaserelated research we could receive up to 91 million of funding for this project which covers basic research activities the development of snp assays and the genotyping to be performed on those assays we recognized revenue under this grant of 37 million in 2003 and as of the end of 2003 we had approximately 54 million of funding remaining related to this project which is expected to be received in 2004 depending on the actual amount of work that we perform government grants and other research funding increased to 32 million for the year ended december 28 2003 from 26 million for the year ended december 29 2002 due to an increase in the number of grants received   to expand revenue in the future we have recently launched a series of new products that we expect to begin selling in 2004 these include our beadstation system for moderate throughput genotyping needs and two multisample whole genome gene expression beadchips that are also processed on a beadstation our beadlab systems address a limited number of potential high throughput genotyping customers and sales of these systems may decline in 2004 versus 2003 we expect the sales of the new products mentioned above to offset such decline and for overall revenues to increase above 2003 levels however we cannot be assured that we will be successful in these sales efforts 

 

    cost of revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process including component materials assembly labor and overhead packaging and delivery cost costs related to research revenue is included in research and development expense cost of product and service revenue increased to 100 million the year ended december 28 2003 from 35 million for the year ended december 29 2002 substantially all of this increase was driven by the sales of our beadlab systems and consumables of which we had none in 2002 as well as the higher level of services revenue during 2003 gross margins on product and service revenues were 60 in the year ended december 28 2003 compared to 52 for the year ended december 29 2002 this increase is due 22 primarily to increased sales of higher margin products and services such as snp genotyping services array matrices and assay reagents we expect product mix will continue to affect our future gross margins we also expect our total cost of product and service revenue to increase in the next year as we sell additional products but to decrease as a percent of product and service revenue due to gains in manufacturing efficiencies and the sale of a larger proportion of higher margin products 

 

    our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design development testing and enhancement of our products we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred research and development expenses decreased 43 million to 225 million for the year ended december 28 2003 from 268 million for the year ended december 29 2002   during the year ended december 28 2003 the cost of beadarray research activities decreased 38 million as compared to the year ended december 29 2002 the decrease occurred primarily as a result of completing the development of new products launched in 2003 the beadchip an additional microarray platform a gene expression application on both our array matrix and beadchip platforms and a benchtop snp genotyping system the beadstation for performing moderate scale genotyping in addition as we completed development efforts and increased our beadarraydriven product sales a smaller portion of our manufacturing resources was charged to research and development expense in 2003 than in 2002   research to support our oligator technology platform decreased 05 million in the year ended december 28 2003 as compared to the year ended december 29 2002 this decline is primarily due to higher development expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2002 for a major upgrade of our oligator technology which resulted in a significant increase in our manufacturing capacity in the second quarter of 2003 we implemented additional oligator manufacturing enhancements to expand capacity increase throughput and further reduce operating costs we expect that our research and development expenses will remain relatively flat over the next 12 months   stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was 13 million for the year ended december 28 2003 as compared to 24 million for the year ended december 29 2002 

 

    our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing finance human resources business development and general management as well as professional fees such as expenses for legal and accounting services selling general and administrative expenses increased 98 million to 189 million for the year ended december 28 2003 from 91 million for the year ended december 29 2002 approximately 44 million of this increase is related to higher legal expenses which is primarily due to legal proceedings regarding the disputes with applied biosystems approximately 41 million of the increase is due to higher sales and marketing costs of which 30 million is attributable to personnel related expenses while the majority of the remaining 11 million is attributable to an increase in facility related expenses during 2003 we 23 significantly expanded our sales and marketing resources to support the direct sale of our new products including establishing additional sales operations in japan and singapore we expect that our selling general and administrative expenses will accelerate as we expand our staff add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the commercialization and support of an increasing number of products 

  stock based compensation related to selling general and administrative employees directors and consultants was 12 million for the year ended december 28 2003 as compared to 20 million for the year ended december 29 2002 

 

    from our inception through july 27 2000 in connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to employees founders and directors we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling 177 million representing the difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated for financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were granted or such restricted stock was sold we recorded this amount as a component of stockholders’ equity and amortize the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock and options   we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for employees founders and directors using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 28 for consultants deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 and is periodically remeasured and expensed in accordance with emerging issues task force no 9618   we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of 25 million and 44 million for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 respectively we expect amortization of deferred compensation to decrease in 2004 due to the nature of the accelerated depreciation methodology as the options near the end of their vesting period 

 

    a 77 million charge was recorded in june 2002 to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit we believe that the termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was unsupported by evidence presented at the trial we plan to vigorously defend our position on appeal a notice of appeal in this case was filed on october 10 2002 and the appeal process is ongoing during the appeal process the court requires us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case is resolved for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 we recorded litigation expense of 756000 and 352000 respectively for interest 24 

 

    interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 18 million and 38 million for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 respectively the decrease is due to lower average levels of invested funds and lower effective interest rates 

 

    interest expense was 23 million for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 interest expense relates primarily to a 260 million fixed rate loan related to the purchase of our new facility during the first quarter of 2002 

 

   we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 and accordingly we did not pay any federal or state income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain as of december 28 2003 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately 695 million and 270 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 and 2006   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 31 million and 26 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 unless previously utilized   our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to section 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code and similar state provisions as a result of changes in our ownership structure these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 

 

 

 

    revenue for the years ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 was 100 million and 25 million respectively product revenue increased to 41 million in 2002 from 09 million in 2001 mostly due to higher sales of oligonucleotides snp genotyping service revenue was 33 million in 2002 compared to 01 million in 2001 as a result of several contracts that were signed during 2002 2001 was the first year of operations for our services and we experienced limited revenues government grants and other research funding increased to 26 million for the year ended decem 25 ber 29 2002 from 15 million for the year ended december 30 2001 due to a larger number of grants that were awarded to us 

 

    cost of product and service revenue for the years ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 was 35 million and 06 million respectively the increase was driven by the increased sales of products and services gross margins on product and service revenues were 52 in 2002 versus 44 in 2001 driven by a more favorable cost structure in oligo manufacturing 

 

    research and development expenses increased 61 million to 268 million for the year ended december 29 2002 from 207 million for the year ended december 30 2001 the increase in expenses was driven primarily by higher headcount related personnel costs and higher laboratory and manufacturing supplies required to continue development of our beadarray technology which is the underlying technology on which illumina was founded during the year ended december 29 2002 the research expense to support our beadarray activities increased 54 million over the same period in 2001 these additional research and development expenses were related to activities such as exploring and optimizing assays for various types of genetic analysis experiments increasing the multiplexing level of our arrays continuing development of our arrays and the scanning instrumentation required to read arrays and building up and optimizing our snp genotyping services system research to support our oligator technology platform increased 07 million during the year ended december 29 2002 as compared to the year ended december 30 2001 during 2002 we introduced upgrades to our oligator technology that significantly increased capacity and quality while reducing manufacturing cost   stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was 24 million for the year ended december 29 2002 as compared to 31 million for the year ended december 30 2001 

 

    selling general and administrative expenses increased 34 million to 91 million for the year ended december 29 2002 from 57 million for the year ended december 30 2001 a portion of this increase is due to higher legal expenses related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit as well as higher legal expenses related to securing patents the remaining increase was due to increases in the sales and marketing costs required to expand and support our custom oligonucleotide sales and snp genotyping services operations 26   stock based compensation related to selling general and administrative employees directors and consultants was 20 million for the year ended december 29 2002 as compared to 27 million for the year ended december 30 2001 

 

    in connection with the grant of stock options and sale of restricted common stock to employees founders and directors through july 27 2000 we recorded deferred compensation of approximately 177 million we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation of 44 million and 59 million for the years ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 respectively 

 

    interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 38 million and 62 million for the years ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 respectively interest income decreased in 2002 due to lower average levels of invested funds and lower effective interest rates 

 

    interest expense was 23 million for the year ended december 29 2002 as compared to 07 million for the year ended december 30 2001 interest expense for the year ended december 29 2002 resulted primarily from a 260 million loan related to the purchase of our new facility during the first quarter of 2002 liquidity and capital resources   as of december 28 2003 we had cash cash equivalents and investments including restricted cash and investments of 100000 of approximately 329 million in addition we had long term restricted investments of 122 million we currently invest our funds in us dollar based investmentgrade corporate and government debt securities with average maturities of approximately 22 months   our operating activities used cash of 183 million in the year ended december 28 2003 as compared to 256 million in the year ended december 29 2002 net cash used in operating activities in 2003 was primarily the result of a net loss from operations of 271 million reduced by noncash charges of 45 million for depreciation and amortization and noncash charges of 25 million for amortization of deferred stock compensation net cash used in operating activities in 2002 was primarily the result of a net loss from operations of 403 million reduced by an 81 million increase in accrued litigation judgment noncash charges of 45 million for depreciation and amortization and noncash charges of 44 million for amortization of deferred stock compensation 27   our investing activities provided cash of 285 million in the year ended december 28 2003 as compared to cash used of 26 million in the year ended december 29 2002 cash provided in investing activities in the year ended december 28 2003 was due primarily to the sale or maturity of investment securities used to provide operating funds for our business while cash used in the year ended december 29 2002 was due primarily to the purchase of a new facility offset by maturities of investment securities capital expenditures were 20 million in 2003 and are expected to increase 1 to 2 million in 2004   our financing activities provided 02 million in the year ended december 28 2003 as compared to 261 million in the year ended december 29 2002 cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december 29 2002 resulted primarily from 260 million in loan proceeds related to the purchase of our new facility   in june 2002 we recorded a 77 million charge to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit as a result of our decision to appeal the ruling we filed a surety bond with the court on october 25 2002 of 15 times the judgment amount or approximately 113 million under the terms of the bond we are required to maintain a letter of credit for 90 of the bond amount to secure the bond further we were required to deposit approximately 125 million of marketable securities as collateral for the letter of credit and accordingly these funds will be restricted from use for corporate purposes until the appeal process is completed if a judgment is due we expect payment will occur within 12 to 18 months   as of the end of 2003 we had funding remaining under existing nih grants of approximately 65 million including 54 million available under the international hapmap project all of these amounts are scheduled to be paid in 2004 subject to the actual amount of activities we perform under these grants   based on our current operating plans we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents investments revenues from sales and funding from grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs for at least 18 to 24 months operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures at the current time we have no material commitments for capital expenditures however our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully commercialize our snp genotyping laboratory and gene expression systems and extensions to those products and to expand our oligonucleotide and snp genotyping services product lines scientific progress in our research and development programs the magnitude of those programs competing technological and market developments the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with applied biosystems and the successful resolution of our appeal in a termination of employment lawsuit therefore we may require additional funding within this time frame and the additional funding if needed may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all further any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights   on december 23 2003 we filed a shelf registration statement that would allow us to raise up to 65 million of funding through the sale of common stock in one or more transactions we currently do not have formal arrangements to sell securities under the registration statement but if market and other business conditions become favorable within the next several months we could put such arrangements in place and attempt to raise at least a portion of the funds covered by the registration statement 

 

   in april 2000 we entered into a 30 million loan arrangement to be used at our discretion to finance purchases of capital equipment 17 million of which remains available at december 28 2003   in january 2002 we purchased two newly constructed buildings and assumed a 260 million 10year mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 836 which calls for principal and interest 28 payments of approximately 25 million per year until the loan expires in january 2012 at which time a balloon payment of 212 million will be due 

  we also lease office space under noncancelable operating leases that expire at various times through december 2006 these leases contain renewal options ranging from 2 to 3 years   as of december 28 2003 our contractual obligations are in thousands  critical accounting policies   revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 101 under sab 101 revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured product revenue consists of sales of oligonucleotides array matrices assay reagents genotyping systems and gene expression systems services revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping services revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured beadlab genotyping system revenue is recognized when earned which is generally upon shipment installation training and fulfillment of contractually defined acceptance criteria reserves are provided for anticipated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized revenue for genotyping services is recognized generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered to the customer we have been awarded 91 million from the national institutes of health to perform genotyping services in connection with the international hapmap project a portion of the revenue from this project is earned at the time the related costs are incurred while the remainder of the revenue is earned upon the delivery of genotyping data research revenue consists of amounts earned under research agreements with government grants which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred all revenues are recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts   we received 10 million of nonrefundable research funding from applied biosystems in connection with a licensing and development contract entered into in 1999 this amount was originally recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with the provisions of sab 101 and would have been recognized as revenue at a contractually defined rate of 25 of the defined operating profit earned from sales of the products covered by the collaboration agreement had such sales occurred at present we do not believe a collaboration product will be commercialized under the partnership agreement and there are legal proceedings between the parties as more fully described in item 3 “legal proceedings” the 10 million of research funding has been reclassified to an advance payment from former collaborator until the legal proceedings have been resolved   cash  investments we invest our excess cash balances in marketable debt securities primarily government securities and corporate bonds and notes with strong credit ratings we classify our investments as “availableforsale” under sfas 115 and record such investments at the estimated fair value in the balance sheet with gains and losses if any reported in stockholders’ equity we periodically review our investments for other than temporary impairment 29 recently issued accounting standards   in november 2002 the fasb emerging issues task force issued its consensus concerning revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables “eitf 0021” eitf 0021 addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and if separation is appropriate how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the identified accounting units eitf 0021 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of eitf 0021 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 45 “fin 45” guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 45 requires a liability to be recorded in the guarantor’s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee in addition fin 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued including a reconciliation of changes in the entity’s product warranty liabilities the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements of fin 45 are effective for financial statements ending after december 15 2002 the adoption of fin 45 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 sfas no 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in sfas no 133 and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows sfas no 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 and to certain preexisting contracts the adoption of sfas no 149 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 150 affects the issuer’s accounting for three types of freestanding financial instruments a mandatorily redeemable shares which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets b put options and forward purchase contracts that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and c obligations that can be settled with shares the monetary value of which is fixed ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index or varies inversely with the value of the issuer’s shares sfas no 150 also requires disclosures about alternative ways of settling the instruments and the capital structure of entities sfas no 150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and for all periods beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of sfas 150 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   in december 2003 the fasb issued a revision to fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46r” consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46r replaces fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities which was issued in january 2003 fin 46r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both a variable interest entity either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources to the entity to support its activities fin 46r is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after december 31 2003 the adoption of fin 46 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 30 factors affecting our operating results   in addition to the items mentioned above the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

 

   we have incurred net losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur net losses at december 28 2003 our accumulated deficit was approximately 1175 million and we incurred a net loss of 271 million for the fiscal year ended december 28 2003 we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future the magnitude of our net losses will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses we expect to continue incurring significant expenses for research and development for developing our manufacturing capabilities and for sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products in addition we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the launch of our beadlab and beadstation snp genotyping system and gene expression systems as a result we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we grow and consequently we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability even if we achieve profitability we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 

 

   we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and function namely snp genotyping and gene expression profiling our first products are being sold into the snp genotyping and focusedgene expression markets both of these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and function if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect and we may never become profitable 

 

   we may not possess all of the resources capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all the products or services that may result from our technologies we only recently sold our first genotyping systems and some of our other technologies are in the early stages of commercialization or are still in development you should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting an early stage company developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries we must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale problems frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services in addition we may need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of our products or services 31   historically life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a variety of technologies compared to the existing technologies our technologies are new and relatively unproven in order to be successful our products must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function   market acceptance will depend on many factors including  

 

   we have limited experience manufacturing our products in the volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales we have only recently begun manufacturing products on a commercial scale and operating our internal snp genotyping service product line for example in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain dna we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields impact our ability to sell these products or to produce them economically may prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 

 

   we currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use if a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services 

 

   the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources for example we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles and beadchip slides included in our products from single vendors if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components we will be unable to meet demand for our products we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of some of our products or develop these capabilities internally and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 

 

   we currently have limited sales and marketing and technical support services and have only recently established a small direct sales force and customer support team in order to effectively 32 commercialize our genotyping and gene expression systems and other products to follow we will need to expand our sales marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services in addition we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place and the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business 

 

   we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and function and other applications using technologies such as twodimensional electrophoresis capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry flow cytometry microfluidics and mechanically deposited inkjet and photolithographic arrays we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards changes in customer needs emerging competition and new product introductions for example we expect affymetrix to release a 100k snp genotyping chip and several competitors have begun selling a single chip for whole human genome expression which may compete with our snp genotyping service and product offerings and our gene expression product offerings one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources broader product lines a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we have furthermore the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could develop competing products if we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

 

   we expect to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans which will place a strain on our human and capital resources if we are unable to manage this growth effectively our losses could increase our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 

 

   our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad these problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights 33   the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries including our patent position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we will apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies   in april 2003 applied biosystems served us with an amended complaint alleging patent infringement asserting that our genotyping products infringe several patents owned by applied biosystems others may challenge or invalidate our patents or claim that we infringe the rights of third party patents however we are not aware of any other such parties that currently intend to pursue patent infringement claims against us also our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace   we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants nevertheless employees collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets in addition others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 

 

   our commercial success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property applied biosystems has served us with an amended complaint alleging patent infringement and other third parties have or may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization in addition third parties have or may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims we may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing our patents against others furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to further develop commercialize and sell products and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be prohibited from selling certain products we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost or at all in that event we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could prevent us from commercializing available products and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain profitability 34 

 

   our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and services the need for capital expenditures to support and expand our business the progress and scope of our research and development projects the filing prosecution and enforcement of patent claims the success of our legal proceedings with applied biosystems and the appeal of a wrongful termination lawsuit we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for at least 18 to 24 months however we premise this expectation on our current operating plan which may change as a result of many factors consequently we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts in addition we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders   we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than an equipment lease line with 17 million unused and available as of december 28 2003 to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 

 

   we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel including jay flatley our president and chief executive officer david barker our vice president and chief scientific officer and john stuelpnagel our senior vice president of operations the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies   our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies including the life sciences and healthcare industries thus we will need to add new personnel including management and develop the expertise of existing management the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 

 

   approximately 144 million of our 2003 revenues were derived from customers outside the united states we intend to continue to expand our international presence and export sales to international customers and we expect the total amount of nonus sales to continue to grow export sales entail a variety of risks including  35    in addition sales to international customers typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection we are also subject to general geopolitical risks such as political social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

   a significant portion of our current revenue is derived from a few large individual transactions such as the sale of production genotyping systems and large genotyping services contracts including our work on the international hapmap project because these transactions do not occur regularly and there is a lengthy sales cycle for such transactions revenue of these types may not occur on a consistent or frequent basis in addition our total amount of revenues is subject to fluctuations in demand from seasonality impacts the timing and amount of us government grant funding programs the timing and size of research projects our customers perform and changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products we may experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly accordingly if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to reduce our operating losses due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors our stock price probably would decline

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments   our equipment financings amounting to 03 million as of december 28 2003 are all at fixed rates and therefore have no exposure to changes in interest rates in january 2002 we assumed a 260 million mortgage in connection with the purchase of a new facility and related land the interest rate on this loan is fixed for a 10year period and consequently there is no exposure to increasing market interest rates   we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations nor do we have any foreign currency hedging instruments in place

 item 11 executive compensation tableend summary of cash and certain other compensation   the following table provides summary information concerning the compensation earned by our chief executive officer and each of our four other most highly compensated executive officers whose salary and bonus for the 2003 fiscal year was in excess of 100000 for services rendered in all capacities to illumina no executive officer who would have otherwise been includable in such table on the basis of salary and bonus earned for the 2003 fiscal year has been excluded by reason of his or her termination of employment or change in executive status during that fiscal year the individuals included in the following table are referred to as named executive officers summary 2003 compensation table   stock option grants   we grant options to our executive officers under our 2000 stock plan as of january 31 2004 options to purchase a total of 5952627 shares of our common stock were outstanding under the stock plan and options to purchase 6299552 shares of our common stock remained available for future grant   the following tables show for the 2003 fiscal year information regarding options granted to exercised by and held at year end by each of the named executive officers no stock appreciation rights were granted to the named executive officers during the 2003 fiscal year   the exercise price of each option was equal to the closing sales price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq stock market on the date of grant the exercise price may be paid in cash or through a cashless exercise procedure involving a sameday sale of the purchased shares the options vest ratably over a 60month period beginning march 2003 each of the options has a maximum term of 10 years measured from the applicable grant date subject to earlier termination if the optionee’s service with us ceases in the event that we are acquired by merger or asset sale each outstanding 41 option which is not to be assumed by the acquiring entity will become immediately fully vested and exercisable 

  the potential realizable value is calculated based on the 10year term of the option at the time of grant stock price appreciation of 5 and 10 is assumed under the sec rules and does not represent our prediction of our stock price performance the potential realizable value at 5 and 10 appreciation are calculated by assuming that the stock price on the date of grant appreciates at the indicated annual rate compounded annually for the entire term of the option and that the option is exercised and sold on the last day of its term for the appreciated stock price there can be no assurance provided to any named executive officer or other holder of our securities that the actual stock price appreciation over the 10year term will be at the assumed 5 and 10 levels or at any other defined level unless the market price of the common stock appreciates over the option term no value will be realized from the option grants made to the named executive officers on december 26 2003 the last trading day of our 2003 fiscal year the closing sales price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market was 701   percentages shown under “percentage of total options granted in 2003” are based on an aggregate of 1199275 options granted to employees of illumina under our stock option plans during 2003  aggregate option exercises in 2003 and option values at december 28 2003   the following table presents the number and value of securities underlying unexercised options that are held by each of the named executive officers no options were exercised by any of the named executive officers and no stock appreciation rights were outstanding during the 2003 fiscal year   amounts shown under the column “value of unexercised inthemoney options at december 28 2003” are based on the closing price of our common stock of 701 on december 26 2003 the last trading day of our 2003 fiscal year as reported on the nasdaq national market less the exercise price paid for such shares without taking into account any taxes that may be payable in connection with the transaction multiplied by the number of shares underlying the option  42 employment contracts termination of employment and change in control arrangements   we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our named executive officers   we have entered into restricted stock purchase agreements with several of our executive officers including each of our named executive officers providing that upon the closing of an acquisition of illumina for cash or publicly traded securities the lapsing of our repurchase right accelerates as to 50 of each officer’s shares of common stock then subject to our repurchase right and with respect to the remaining 50 on the first anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition if the acquirer terminates the officer’s employment without cause within one year of the closing date our repurchase right lapses with respect to all shares   the compensation committee of the board of directors as plan administrator of our stock plans has the authority to provide for accelerated vesting of any outstanding options or waiver of forfeiture restrictions of unvested stock held by our executive officers for any reason including upon a change of control compensation committee interlocks and insider participation   our executive compensation program has been administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors as of december 28 2003 the compensation committee consisted of mr nelsen and dr rastetter neither of these individuals was an employee or an officer of ours   none of our current executive officers has ever served as a member of a board of directors or compensation committee of any other entity that has or has had one or more executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or compensation committee during the last fiscal year board compensation committee report on executive compensation   the compensation committee’s responsibility is to administer and review the base salaries annual incentive compensation and longterm incentives of our executive officers including our chief executive officer and to establish the general compensation policies for such individuals the compensation committee also has the authority to make discretionary option grants to our executive officers under our 2000 stock plan   compensation philosophy our philosophy is to maintain an executive compensation program that allows us to attract retain and reward executive officers who contribute to our longterm success and to link that compensation to both individual performance and the value created for our stockholders we have adopted a challenging strategy with an aggressive set of underlying goals and our success will in large part be determined by the quality of personnel we are able to recruit a competitive compensation program will be a crucial part of recruiting the people required to help us achieve these goals   our compensation program consist of three elements base salary incentive bonuses and longterm equity incentives in general our goal is to provide a total compensation package that is competitive with the biotechnology and life science instrumentation companies with which we compete for talent   base salary the salaries for executive officers for 2003 were generally determined on an individual basis by the compensation committee determinations of appropriate base salary levels are made based on level of responsibility prior experience and breadth of knowledge as well as competitive pay practices in our industry initial salary levels are set at the market average when compared to leading companies in our industry adjusted for size subsequent changes to base salary are based on individual performance measured against preestablished objectives and competitive factors at the time   incentive bonus the compensation committee in its discretion may award bonuses to executive officers the intent of the bonus program is to motivate and reward executives for performance as 43 measured against well defined performance goals the goals are based on both individual milestones that vary with the individual’s position as well as our overall financial performance 

  longterm equity incentives stock options and stock ownership are a key element in our total compensation program as it links the interests of the executive with the longterm interests of the stockholders and emphasizes the creation of stockholder value prior to our initial public offering executives were provided the opportunity to purchase restricted stock at the date of hire and at other times after that date subsequent to our initial public offering we have granted stock options to executives under the 2000 stock plan at both the time of hire and as subsequent awards grants are awarded based on a number of factors including our achievement of specific milestones the individual’s level of responsibility the amount and term of stock or options already held by the individual the individual’s contributions to the achievement of our financial and strategic objectives and industry practices and norms the size of option grants to executives is determined by the compensation committee options are granted at 100 of the fair market value on the date of grant option grants to executives generally vest over periods ranging from five to eight years with opportunities in some cases for earlier vesting based upon the achievement of specified goals   ceo compensation the compensation of jay t flatley our chief executive officer is established consistent with illumina’s general compensation philosophy in setting that salary the compensation committee considered several factors including the achievement of company goals during 2003 such as exceeding the 2003 sales goal for snp genotyping systems and the launch of several new products as well as the level of leadership and management required to complete development of our technology and commercialize our products mr flatley’s salary was increased from 340000 in 2002 to 360400 in 2003 in recognition of these and other competitive factors mr flatley also received a 96107 bonus in 2003 based on the same incentive plan as the other executive officers   compliance with internal revenue code section 162m section 162m of the internal revenue code disallows a tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to specified executive officers to the extent that compensation exceeds 1 million per covered officer in any fiscal year the limitation applies only to compensation that is not considered to be performancebased nonperformance based compensation paid to our executive officers for the 2003 fiscal year did not exceed the 1 million limit per officer the compensation committee does not anticipate that the nonperformance based compensation to be paid to our executive officers for fiscal year 2004 will exceed that limit our stock option plans have been structured so that any compensation deemed paid in connection with the exercise of option grants made under those plan with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the option shares on the grant date will qualify as performancebased compensation which will not be subject to the 1 million limitation the compensation committee’s present intention is to grant future compensation that does not exceed the limitations of section 162m although the compensation committee reserves the right to award compensation that does not comply with these limits on a casebycase basis   it is the opinion of the compensation committee that the executive compensation policies and plans provide the necessary total remuneration program to properly align our performance and the interests of our stockholders through the use of competitive and equitable executive compensation in a balanced and reasonable manner for both the short and longterm   we conclude our report with the acknowledgement that no member of the compensation committee is a current officer or employee of illumina  44 audit committee report   the audit committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of our board of directors management has primary responsibility for the financial reporting process including the systems of internal controls in fulfilling its oversight role the audit committee monitors and advises the board of directors on the integrity of the company’s financial statements and disclosures the independent auditor’s qualifications and independence the adequacy of the company’s internal controls and the

 item 1 business overview   we are a leading developer of nextgeneration tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine a key goal of genomics and proteomics our tools provide information that could be used to improve drugs and therapies customize diagnoses and treatment and cure disease   completion of the sequencing of the human genome will drive demand for tools that can assist researchers in processing the billions of tests necessary to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information this requires functional analysis of highly complex biological systems involving a scale of experimentation not practical using currently available tools and technologies using our technologies we have developed a comprehensive line of products that can address the scale of experimentation and the breadth of functional analysis required to achieve the goals of molecular medicine   our patented beadarray technology uses fiber optics to achieve a level of array miniaturization that allows for a new scale of experimentation an array is a collection of miniaturized test sites arranged on a surface that permits many tests or assays to be performed in parallel by arranging our arrays in a pattern that matches the wells of industry standard containers called microtiter plates we can simultaneously process many samples in parallel achieving throughput significantly beyond the capability of any technology known to us we assemble our arrays using relatively inexpensive materials our proprietary manufacturing process allows us to easily adapt the arrays to a broad range of applications these characteristics allow us to create nextgeneration arrays with a unique combination of high throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility in addition our complementary oligator technology permits parallel synthesis of the millions of different pieces of dna necessary to perform largescale genetic analysis on arrays   we provide both products and services that utilize our proprietary technologies during 2001 we launched our commercial snp genotyping services product line which combines our beadarray technology with an automated laboratory information management system or lims controlled process to provide high throughput identification of the most common form of genetic variation known as single nucleotide 2 polymorphisms or snps we also manufacture custom oligonucleotides for sale using our proprietary oligator technology 

  in the third quarter of 2002 we announced the launch of our production scale genotyping laboratory this system is built around our proprietary beadarray technology included in the system are sherlock scanning equipment goldengate assay protocols lims and analytical software fluidhandling robotics and access to sentrix array matrices and reagent kits for analyzing genetic sequences our sentrix array matrix is a collection of individual arrays arranged in a pattern compatible with standard microtiter plates our reagent kit uses goldengate assay protocols and comprises a set of chemicals used for performing specific genotyping analyses and our sherlock scanning instrument is a confocal laser scanner used to read our array matrices our genotyping system is based on the production laboratory that has been operational in our genotyping service product line when installed the genotyping system will be able to routinely produce one million genotypes per day as of the end of february 2003 we have signed agreements for the sale of two genotyping laboratories   in the fourth quarter of 2002 we were named the largest us participant in the 100 million international hapmap project funded by the national institutes of health a haplotype map of the human genome will allow more rapid and efficient largescale genetic association studies aimed at discovering variants contributing to human disease and differential response to drug treatments we are one of five funded us participants in a worldwide initiative that includes research groups in canada china japan nigeria and the united kingdom we will be directly responsible for mapping over 15 of the haplotypes in the human genome this effort leverages our oligator dna synthesis capability and the productionscale throughput of our genotyping services operation   we were incorporated in california in april 1998 we reincorporated in delaware in july 2000 our principal executive offices are located at 9885 towne centre drive san diego california 92121 our telephone number is 858 2024500 industry background 

 

   every person inherits two copies of each gene one from each parent the two copies of each gene may be identical or they may be different these differences are referred to as genetic variation examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color genetic variation can also have important medical consequences including predisposition to disease and differential response to drugs genetic variation affects diseases including cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease and alzheimer’s disease in addition genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug some people may respond well others may not respond at all and still others may experience adverse side effects the most common form of genetic variation is a single nucleotide polymorphism or snp a snp is a variation in a single position in a dna sequence it is estimated that the human genome contains between three and six million snps   while in some cases a single snp will be responsible for medically important effects it is now believed that the genetic component of most major diseases is the result of the interaction of many snps therefore it will be important to investigate many snps together in order to discover medically valuable information   current efforts to understand genetic variation and function have centered around three principal techniques snp genotyping gene expression profiling and proteomics 

 

   snp genotyping is the process of determining which snps are present in each of the two copies of a gene or other portion of dna sequence within an individual or other organism the use of snp genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual snp or a collection of snps and to apply that information to clinical trials and diagnostic testing will require the analysis of millions of snp genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease for example a single large clinical trial could involve 3 genotyping 200000 snps per patient in 1000 patients thus requiring 200 million assays using available technologies this scale of snp genotyping is both impractical and prohibitively expensive 

  largescale snp genotyping will be used for a variety of applications including genomicsbased drug development clinical trial analysis disease predisposition testing and disease diagnosis snp genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare for example in the development of plants and animals with desirable commercial characteristics these markets will require billions of snp genotyping assays annually 

 

   gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mrna the intermediary between genes and proteins variation in gene expression can cause disease or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease by comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different environments such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified studies of this type used in drug discovery require monitoring thousands and preferably tens of thousands of mrnas in large numbers of samples once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples for example within a clinical trial the high cost of current gene expression methods has limited the development of the gene expression market   once gene expression patterns have been correlated to specific diseases gene expression profiling is expected to become an important diagnostic tool diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more costeffective technologies 

 

   proteomics is the process of determining which proteins are present in cells and how they interact with one another proteomics is another method of correlating the molecular state of a cell with disease or reaction to a stimulus such as a drug this market remains undeveloped as low cost accurate technologies for analysis have not been available we expect that proteomics will become valuable in drug discovery research as the technologies improve and that array technology will be critical in facilitating the growth of this market our technologies 

 

   we have developed a proprietary array technology that enables the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function our beadarray technology combines fiber optic bundles and microscopic beads in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce array matrices that can perform many assays simultaneously our beadarray technology provides a unique combination of high throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility we achieve high throughput with a high density of test sites per array and our ability to format arrays in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates we maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples and from the low manufacturing costs associated with our complementary technologies our ability to vary the size shape and format of the fiber optic bundles and to create specific bead pools for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments we believe that these features will enable our beadarray technology to become a leading platform for the emerging highgrowth markets of snp genotyping gene expression profiling and proteomics   our proprietary beadarray technology combines fiber optic bundles and specially prepared beads that selfassemble into an array we have the fiber optic bundles manufactured to our specifications which we cut into lengths of less than one inch each bundle contains approximately 50000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an aluminum housing which forms an array matrix in a separate process we create sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch we make 4 different batches of beads with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule the particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function as a sensor for example we create a batch of snp sensors by attaching a particular dna sequence to each bead in the batch we combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to create a bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce thousands of arrays one of the advantages of this technology is that it allows us to create universal arrays for snp genotyping all of our snp genotyping arrays are manufactured with the same set of sensors this allows us to manufacture one type of array and by varying the reagent kit still be able to use it to test for any combination of snps 

  to form an array we typically dip each fiber optic bundle into a pool of coated beads the coated beads are drawn into the wells no more than one bead per well on the end of each fiber in the bundle we call this process selfassembly the tens of thousands of beads at the end of the fiber optic bundle comprise our beadarray because the beads assemble randomly into the wells we perform a final procedure called decoding in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array we employ several proprietary methods for decoding a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array one beneficial byproduct of the decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by having multiple copies of each bead type this improves the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads   one performs an experiment on the beadarray matrices by preparing a sample such as dna from a patient and introducing it to the array the design features of our beadarray matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution containing the sample the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated bead the sherlock scanning instrument detects the matched molecules by shining a laser through the fiber optic bundle since the molecules in the sample have a structure that causes them to emit light in response to a laser detection of a binding event is possible this allows the measurement of the number of molecules bound to each coated bead resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 

 

   genomic applications require many different short pieces of dna that can be made synthetically called oligonucleotides for example snp genotyping typically requires three to four different oligonucleotides per assay a snp genotyping experiment analyzing 10000 snps may therefore require 30000 to 40000 different oligonucleotides contributing significantly to the expense of the experiment   we have designed our proprietary oligator technology for the parallel synthesis of many different oligonucleotides to meet the requirements of largescale genomics applications we believe that our oligator technology is substantially more cost effective and provides higher throughput than available commercial alternatives our technology allows for the automated parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides within each machine depending on the length of the oligonucleotide each machine can synthesize approximately 2500 to 3000 oligonucleotides per day we believe we can expand this technology in the future and produce instruments with greater capacity which will produce oligonucleotides at a lower cost 

 

   we believe that our beadarray and oligator technologies provide distinct advantages in a variety of applications over competing technologies by creating costeffective highly miniaturized arrays with the following advantages   high throughput the miniaturization of our beadarray matrix provides significantly greater information content per unit area than any other array known to us to further increase throughput we have formatted our arrays in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates allowing throughput levels of up to 3 million unique assays per microtiter plate the oligator’s parallel synthesis capability allows us to manufacture the diversity of oligonucleotides necessary to support largescale genomic applications 5   cost effectiveness our beadarray matrix substantially reduces the cost of experiments as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances in fiber optics digital imaging and bead chemistry in addition our miniaturized beadarray matrix requires smaller volumes than other array technologies and therefore reduces reagent costs our oligator technology further reduces reagent costs as well as the cost of coating beads   flexibility a wide variety of conventional chemistries are available for attaching different molecules such as dna rna proteins and other chemicals to beads by using beads we are able to take advantage of these chemistries to create a wide variety of sensors which we assemble into arrays using the same proprietary manufacturing process in addition we can have fiber optic bundles manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes and organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different markets and market segments in combination the use of beads and fiber optic bundles provides the flexibility and scalability for our beadarray technology to be tailored to perform many applications in many different market segments from drug discovery to diagnostics our oligator technology allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of oligonucleotides   accuracy the high density of beads in each array enables us to have multiple copies of each individual bead type we measure the copies simultaneously and combine them into one data point this allows us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population of identical beads which permits the statistical calculation of a more reliable and accurate value for each data point finally the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on every array improving the overall accuracy of the data our strategy   our goal is to make our beadarray platform the industry standard for products and services utilizing array technologies we plan to achieve this by  products and services   the first implementation of our beadarray technology the sentrix array is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96well microtiter plate each fiber optic bundle performs more than 1100 unique assays therefore one sentrix array can perform nearly 110000 individual assays simultaneously more than any other array system known to us   we have provided genotyping services using our proprietary beadarray platform in addition we have developed our first genotyping products based on our array of arrays technology these products include disposable sentrix array matrices goldengate reagent kits for snp genotyping and sherlock scanning instruments 

 

   during 2001 we introduced the first commercial application of our beadarray technology by launching our snp genotyping services product line we signed our first services contract with glaxosmithkline in 2001 and we entered into 18 service contracts during 2002 during the last month of the year we completed over 34 million genotypes including several days in which we operated at two million genotypes per day to our knowledge no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low cost 6   we have designed our first consumable beadarray product the sentrix array matrix for snp genotyping the sentrix array matrix uses a universal format that allows it to analyze any set of snps we have also developed reagent kits based on goldengate assay protocols and a confocal laser scanner sherlock which is used to read our array matrices these three components combined with lims standard operating procedures and analytical software and fluid handling robotics comprise our snp genotyping system this system was commercialized in late 2002 and is based on the system that has been operational in our genotyping service product line for over a year when installed the genotyping system will be able to routinely produce one million genotypes per day   in january 2003 we announced the availability of two assay sets one for genetic linkage analysis and the other for fine chromosomal or wholegenome mapping these standard products have been deployed in our genotyping services operation and are also available for customers who use our snp genotyping system genetic linkage analysis can help identify chromosomal regions with potential disease associations fine mapping provides dense genotyping and may enable target gene identification related to a specific disease 

 

   we will design our first product for gene expression profiling to test selected sets of approximately 100 to 2000 genes on large numbers of samples we believe that there is currently a need for a costeffective and highthroughput gene expression profiling technology to analyze the activity of selected sets of genes from many samples simultaneously 

 

   we have developed a confocal laser scanning instrument sherlock which is used to scan our sentrix array matrices and is part of our production scale snp genotyping laboratory this scanning equipment was designed to be used in all areas of genetic analysis that use our sentrix arrays 

 

   we have put in place an oligonucleotide manufacturing facility that currently has the capability of producing approximately 16 million oligonucleotides per year in addition to their use to coat beads these oligonucleotides are components of the reagent kits for our beadarray products and are used for assay development because our production capacity exceeds our internal needs we began to offer oligonucleotides for sale to high volume users in 2001 we provide oligonucleotides in a wide range of lengths and in several scales with the ability to add many types of modifications we offer a range of quality control options and have implemented a laboratory information management system to control much of the manufacturing process in february 2003 we introduced the first of a series of standard product offerings in our oligator product line a wholegenome oligonucleotide reference set designed and optimized for spotted gene expression microarrays we believe our proprietary oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide sets under a price leadership strategy partnerships and collaborations   in november 1999 we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems a division of applera corporation under which the companies would jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray tm technology with applied biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology under this agreement we were responsible for developing and manufacturing the arrays and applied biosystems was responsible for developing and manufacturing the instruments snp assay reagents and software and for marketing the system worldwide in conjunction with the agreement applied biosystems purchased 125 million shares of series c convertible preferred stock at 400 per share in addition applied biosystems agreed to provide us with nonrefundable research and development support of 10 million all of which was provided by december 2001 upon commercialization of the system we were to receive a share of the operating profits from the sales of all components of these systems should such sales occur 7   in july 2002 applied biosystems indicated that the planned mid2002 launch of this genotyping system would be delayed a second time this delay was related to applied biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the snp assay reagents it is our current belief that applied biosystems has no intention of continuing to develop a collaboration product with us as a result of the delay in developing the collaboration product we launched our own productionscale genotyping system in july 2002 in december 2002 we announced that we had notified applied biosystems that it was in breach of the joint development agreement this notification followed a patent infringement suit filed by applied biosystems against us and a notification from applied biosystems alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to the agreement for further information regarding this matter please see item 3 “legal proceedings” and item 7 “managements’ discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we do not have any other significant partnerships or collaborations research and development   we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception we have assembled a team of skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology chemistry informatics instrumentation optical systems software manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize our beadarray and oligator technologies so that we can commercialize the initial products and services derived from these technologies these efforts include among others    our research and development expenses for the fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000 exclusive of charges relating to stock based compensation of 24 million 31 million and 39 million respectively were 268 million 207 million and 136 million respectively we expect research and development expense to increase in the future as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts 8 government grants   government grants allow us to fund internal scientific programs and exploratory research we retain ownership of all intellectual property and commercial rights generated during these projects subject to a nonexclusive nontransferable paidup license to practice for or on behalf of the united states inventions made with federal funds this license is retained by the us government as provided by applicable statutes and regulations we do not believe that the retained license will have any impact on our ability to market our products and we do not need government approval with respect to this license in order to enter into collaborations or other relationships with third parties we have seven grants from the national institutes of health including a 9 million award in connection with our role in the human haplotyping effort intellectual property   we have an extensive patent portfolio including ownership of or exclusive licenses to 23 issued us patents and 48 pending us patent applications including one allowed application that has not yet issued as a patent some of which derive from a common parent application our issued patents which cover various aspects of our beadarray oligonucleotide synthesis and chemical detection technologies expire between 2011 and 2020 we are seeking to extend this patent protection on our beadarray goldengate oligator sentrix and related technologies we have received or filed counterparts for many of these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries   we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow copyright and trademark protection as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our beadarray goldengate and oligator sentrix and sherlock technologies   we are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements with third parties which grant us rights to use key aspects of our array technology assay methods chemical detection methods reagent kits and scanning equipment for example we have an exclusive license from tufts university to patents filed by dr david walt a member of our board of directors the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents which will occur between 2010 and 2017 we also have nonexclusive licenses related to confocal scanning instrumentation and our goldengate assay these licenses are critical to our business manufacturing   we manufacture our array matrices reagent kits scanning equipment and oligonucleotides inhouse and believe that we currently have the ability to manufacture these in sufficient quantity to meet anticipated internal and external needs we currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our products we intend to continue and may extend the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing process to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best commercial interests   during 2001 we moved into a new facility which allowed us to design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific processes and optimize material flow and personnel movement in addition we have implemented custom laboratory information management systems for many of our manufacturing and services operations to manage all aspects of material and sample use we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal state and local health ordinances such as standards for the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances competition   although we expect that our beadarray products and services will provide significant advantages over currently available products and services we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the snp genotyping gene expression and proteomics markets these include companies such as aclara biosciences affymetrix agilent amersham biosciences applied 9 biosystems beckman coulter caliper technologies luminex perlegen sciences sequenom and third wave technologies many of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we do in addition they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we need to address each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in the future in order to effectively compete with these companies we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput cost and accuracy advantages over the existing products rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies although we believe that our technology and products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful

 item 2 properties   our principal research and development manufacturing and administrative facilities occupy approximately 90000 square feet of three buildings located in san diego california which we purchased along with eight acres of adjacent land in january 2002 in connection with this purchase we assumed a 26 million 10year mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 836 we lease a total of 26000 square feet of this space to two tenants the land has been approved for construction of a fourth building we expect that these facilities including the potential fourth building will be sufficient for our san diego based operations for the foreseeable future 


 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   in march 2001 a complaint seeking damages of an unspecified amount was filed against us by a former employee in the superior court of the state of california in connection with the employee’s termination of employment with illumina in july 2002 a california superior court judgment was rendered against the company and we recorded a 77 million charge in our financial results for the second quarter of 2002 to cover total damages and remaining expenses we believe that the termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was unsupported by evidence presented at the trial a notice of appeal in this case was filed on october 10 2002 and the appeal process is ongoing we are also recording interest expense on the 77 million during the appeal based on the statutory rate   in december 2002 applied biosystems group filed a patent infringement suit against illumina in the federal district court in northern california asserting infringement of several patents related to an applied biosystems’ assay intended for use in our collaboration to date applied biosystems has not yet served us with this patent infringement complaint in that complaint applied biosystems is seeking a judgment granting it damages for infringement treble damages alleging that such infringement is willful and a permanent injunction restraining us from the alleged infringement also in december 2002 applied biosystems sent a notification to us alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement between illumina and applied biosystems entered into in november 1999 and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement this notification alleges that our productionscale genotyping system and our consumables are collaboration products developed under the joint development agreement that these products are being sold within the collaboration field described in that agreement and that our commercial activities with respect to our genotyping system are unlawful unfair or fraudulent among other relief it sought via an arbitration proceeding applied biosystems sought compensatory damages of 30 million disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of our genotyping system or through our genotyping services product line and a prohibition of future sales of these products or services we responded in a letter notification dated december 4 2002 to applied biosystems that applied biosystems was in breach of the joint development agreement having twice delayed the launch of our collaborative product and despite our continual compliance with our obligations under this agreement and further disputing that the arbitration proceeding was appropriate   on december 11 2002 we filed a suit alleging breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing unfair competition and other allegations against applied biosystems in san diego superior court and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by applied biosystems the court granted our temporary restraining order on december 12 2002 we then moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the arbitration from proceeding until a trial in the superior court case while applied biosystems brought a motion seeking to dismiss this superior court action and to compel arbitration between the parties in february 2003 we amended our complaint to additionally allege that we had been fraudulently induced by applied biosystems into entering into an agreement to arbitrate certain disputes by misrepresenting the purpose and intended effect of the arbitration provision of the 1999 joint development agreement on february 18 2003 the san diego superior court granted our motion for preliminary injunction to prevent the arbitration process and denied applied 12 biosystem’s motion to compel arbitration without prejudice applied biosystems subsequently moved to demur to the claim of fraudulent inducement and that motion in now pending no trial date has been set for this case 

  we believe the claims alleged by applied biosystems are without merit in both the patent infringement case and their enjoined demand for arbitration and that we have a strong case regarding our breach of contract and other related allegations against applied biosystems however we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these matters if we are unable to successfully defend against these allegations it could result in a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations   we are not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings from time to time we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the usual course of business 


 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders   no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2002 

part ii 


 item 5 market for registrant’s common stock and related stockholder matters tableend   our common stock has been quoted on the nasdaq national market under the symbol “ilmn” since july 28 2000 prior to that time there was no public market for our common stock the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the quarterly high and low closing prices per share of the common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market our present policy is to retain earnings if any to finance future growth we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future     at march 14 2003 there were approximately 172 stockholders of record and the price per share of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market on such date was 211 sales of unregistered securities   none use of proceeds   on july 27 2000 we commenced our initial public offering pursuant to a registration statement on form s1 file no 33333922 resulting in net offering proceeds of 1013 million we will continue to use proceeds from our initial public offering to fund operations through december 29 2002 we have used approximately 16 million to purchase property plant and equipment and approximately 19 million to fund 13 general operating expenses the remaining balance is invested in a variety of interestbearing instruments including us treasury securities corporate debt securities and money market accounts 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend   the following discussion and analysis should be read with “selected financial data” and our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the discussion and analysis in this annual report on form 10k may contain forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans objectives expectations and intentions the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as applying to all related forwardlooking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in “factors affecting operating results” below as well as those discussed elsewhere overview   illumina inc was incorporated in april 1998 we are developing nextgeneration tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function the information provided by these analyses will help enable the development of personalized medicine a key goal of genomics and proteomics our proprietary beadarray technology will provide the throughput cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics this information will correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states enhancing drug discovery allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients our technology may also have applicability across a wide variety of industries beyond life sciences and pharmaceuticals including agriculture food chemicals and petrochemicals however we do not currently expect that these markets will have the revenue potential of the life sciences market in the first quarter of 2001 we began commercial sale of custom oligonucleotides manufactured using our proprietary oligator technology as a result of our favorable manufacturing cost structure we have been able to implement a price leadership strategy in the platebased segment of this market and have steadily been able to grow our market share in the second quarter of 2001 we initiated our snp genotyping services product line and we have entered into 18 service contracts in 2002 as a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput low cost beadarray technology we have entered into significant contracts with many of the leading genotyping organizations including glaxosmithkline and the sanger centre and have recently received a 9 million award from the national institutes of health to play a major role in the human haplotyping effort   in november 1999 we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems under which the companies would jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray technology with applied biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology under this agreement we were responsible for developing and manufacturing the arrays and applied biosystems was responsible for developing and manufacturing the instruments snp assay reagents and software and for marketing the system worldwide in conjunction with the agreement applied biosystems purchased 125 million shares of series c convertible preferred stock at 400 per share in addition applied biosystems agreed to provide us with nonrefundable research and development support of 10 million all of which was provided by december 2001 upon 15 commercialization of the system we would receive a share of the operating profits from the sales of all components of these systems we have deferred recognition of revenue from the research funding of 10 million provided by applied biosystems and would recognize such amounts as revenue at the rate of 25 of the total profit share we earn from the sales of collaborative products should such sales occur 

  in july 2002 applied biosystems indicated that the planned mid2002 launch of this genotyping system would be delayed a second time this delay was related to applied biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the snp assay reagents it is our current belief that applied biosystems has no intention of continuing to develop a collaboration product with us as a result of the delay in developing the collaboration product we launched our own productionscale genotyping system in july 2002 in december 2002 applied biosystems filed a patent infringement suit against us in the federal district court in northern california asserting infringement of several patents related to applied biosystems’ patented assay to date applied biosystems has not served us with the complaint filed in this suit applied biosystems is seeking a judgment granting it damages for infringement treble damages alleging that such infringement is willful and a permanent injunction restraining us from the alleged infringement also in december 2002 applied biosystems sent a notification to us alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement entered into in november 1999 and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement this notification alleges that our productionscale genotyping system and our consumables are collaboration products developed under the joint development agreement that these products are being sold within the collaboration field described in that agreement and that our commercial activities with respect to its genotyping system are unlawful unfair or fraudulent among other items applied biosystems is seeking compensatory damages of 30 million disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of our genotyping system or through our genotyping services product line and a prohibition of future sales of these products or services   in december 2002 we filed a suit alleging breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing unfair competition and other allegations against applied biosystems in san diego superior court and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by applied biosystems the court granted the temporary restraining order we then moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the arbitration from proceeding while applied biosystems brought a motion seeking to compel arbitration between the parties in february 2003 we amended our complaint to additionally allege that we had been fraudulently induced by applied biosystems into entering into an agreement to arbitrate certain disputes by misrepresenting the purpose and intended effect of the arbitration provision of the 1999 joint development agreement on february 18 2003 the san diego superior court granted our motion for preliminary injunction and denied applied biosystem’s motion to compel arbitration without prejudice no trial date has been set for this case we will continue to treat the 10 million funding from applied biosystems as deferred revenue until the status of the collaboration agreement has been resolved   we are in the early stages of proceedings to resolve the status of the collaboration agreement and the legal actions brought by both parties we believe the claims alleged by applied biosystems are without merit in both the patent infringement case and their enjoined demand for arbitration and that we have a strong case regarding our allegations against applied biosystems however we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these matters if we are unable to successfully defend against these allegations it could result in a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations   our productionscale genotyping system is based on the system developed by the company that has been operational in our genotyping service product line since 2001 in addition to our arrays it includes the sherlock proprietary confocal laser scanner as well as the highly multiplexed goldengate snp genotyping assay we do not believe that any of these product components are covered by intellectual property held by applied biosystems or are otherwise within the scope of the collaboration agreement with applied biosystems consequently we would retain all the operating profits if any generated through the sales of systems and consumables rather than share profits under the collaboration agreement this system is initially being marketed to a small number of high throughput genotyping users however over time we will need to develop lower throughput versions of the system as well as additional genetic analysis applications which will be marketed more broadly and require substantial increases in our sales and marketing expenses 16   as a result of the 2001 launch of our snp genotyping services and custom oligonucleotide product lines we generated commercial product and service revenue of approximately 10 million during fiscal 2001 and approximately 74 million during fiscal year 2002 in 2003 we announced agreements for the sale of our first two highthroughput snp genotyping systems we are seeking to expand our customer base for these products and services however we have no assurance that our sales efforts will be successful in developing a market for systems such as this   we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception as of december 29 2002 our accumulated deficit was 904 million and total stockholders’ equity was 717 million these losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services as well as charges of 81 million related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit we expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing costs for research development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years we will also need to significantly increase our selling general and administrative costs as we begin to build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems other products and services as a result we will need to increase revenue significantly to achieve profitability results of operations 

 

 

 

   revenue for the years ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 was 100 million and 25 million respectively product revenue increased to 41 million in 2002 from 09 million in 2001 mostly due to higher sales of oligonucleotides we have continued to grow sales and market share as a result of our product quality and price leadership strategy in the platebased oligonucleotide market segment snp genotyping service revenue was 33 million in 2002 compared to 01 million in 2001 as a result of the 18 contracts that were signed during 2002 government grants and other research funding accounted for approximately 26 and 60 of our total revenue for the year ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 respectively we expect grant revenue to generally decline as a proportion of total revenue over the next few years as product and service revenue become a more important part of our business 

 

   cost of product and service revenue for the years ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 was 35 million and 06 million respectively the increase was driven by increased sales of products and services gross margins on product and service revenues were 52 in 2002 versus 44 in 2001 driven by a more favorable cost structure in oligo manufacturing costs related to research revenue is included in research and development expense 

 

   our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses facility costs and laboratory and manufacturing supplies total research and development expenses increased 61 million to 268 million for the year ended december 29 2002 from 207 million for the year ended december 30 2001 the increase in expenses was driven primarily by higher headcount related personnel costs and higher laboratory and manufacturing supplies required to continue development of our beadarray technology which is the underlying technology on which illumina was founded during the year ended december 29 2002 the research expense to support our beadarray activities increased 54 million over the same period in 2001 these additional research and development expenses were related to activities such as exploring and optimizing assays for various types of genetic analysis experiments increasing the multiplexing level of our arrays continuing development of our arrays and the scanning instrumentation required to read arrays and building up and optimizing our snp genotyping services system research to support our oligator technology platform increased 07 million during the year ended december 29 2002 as compared to the year ended december 30 2001 during 2002 we introduced upgrades to our oligator 17 technology that significantly increased capacity and quality while reducing manufacturing cost allowing us to adopt a price leadership strategy in the markets we serve we expect that our research and development expenses including facilities related costs will increase moderately over the next 12 months as we transition several products from development to commercialization and then increase more substantially in future years to support research and technology development for new products 

 

   our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing finance human resources business development and general management as well as professional fees such as expenses for legal and accounting services selling general and administrative expenses increased 34 million to 91 million for the year ended december 29 2002 from 57 million for the year ended december 30 2001 a portion of this increase is due to higher legal expenses related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit and the legal proceedings regarding applied biosystems as well as higher expenses related to securing patents the remaining increase was due to increases in the sales and marketing costs required to expand and support our custom oligonucleotide sales and snp genotyping services operations during the third and fourth quarters of 2002 we began our sales and marketing expansion into europe and in early 2003 we began our expansion into japan we expect that our selling general and administrative expenses will accelerate as we expand our staff add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support our growth in addition as a result of our decision to launch our own genotyping system we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase at a faster rate than earlier anticipated since we will now be solely responsible for the marketing and support of this system 

 

   from our inception through july 27 2000 in connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to employees founders and directors we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling 177 million representing the difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated for financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were granted or such restricted stock was sold we recorded this amount as a component of stockholders’ equity and amortize the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock and options   we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for employees founders and directors using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 28 for consultants deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 and is periodically remeasured and expensed in accordance with emerging issues task force no 9618   we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of 44 million and 59 million for the year ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 respectively subsequent to july 27 2000 no deferred compensation has been recorded as all options have been granted at fair market value 

 

   a 77 million charge was recorded in june 2002 to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit we believe that the termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was unsupported by evidence presented at the trial we plan to vigorously defend our position on appeal a notice of appeal in this case was filed on october 10 2002 and the appeal process is ongoing during the appeal process the court requires us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case is resolved in the year ended december 29 2002 we recorded 352000 for interest 

 

   interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 38 million and 62 million for the years ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 respectively interest income decreased in 2002 due to lower average levels of invested funds and lower effective interest rates 18 

 

   interest expense was 23 million for the year ended december 29 2002 as compared to 07 million for the year ended december 30 2001 interest expense for the year ended december 29 2002 resulted primarily from a 260 million loan related to the purchase of our new facility during the first quarter of 2002 

 

   we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december 29 2002 and december 30 2001 and accordingly we did not pay any federal or state income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain as of december 29 2002 we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately 556 million and 309 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 and 2008   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 24 million and 18 million respectively which begin to expire in 2018 unless previously utilized   our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to section 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code and similar state provisions as a result of changes in our ownership structure these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 

 

 

 

   revenue for the years ended december 30 2001 and december 31 2000 was 25 million and 13 million respectively government grants and other research funding accounted for approximately 60 and 97 of our total revenue for the years ended december 30 2001 and december 31 2000 respectively in 2001 we began sales of custom oligonucleotides and most of the product revenue for this year was derived from those sales 

 

   cost of product and service revenue for the year ended december 30 2001 which was the first year we commenced such revenue was 06 million there was no cost of product and service revenue for the year ended december 31 2000 

 

   research and development expenses increased 72 million to 207 million for the year ended december 30 2001 from 135 million for the year ended december 31 2000 this increase was due primarily to increased staffing and other personnel costs to support the continued research and scaleup of our beadarray and oligator technologies during 2001 our research activities to support these technologies increased 55 million and 05 million respectively the remaining 12 million of expense increase was related to manufacturing process improvement activities mostly related to automating various parts of the manufacturing process to improve yields cost quality and processing time 

 

   selling general and administrative expenses increased 15 million to 57 million for the year ended december 30 2001 from 42 million for the year ended december 31 2000 a portion of this increase was due to increases in the sales and marketing costs required to launch and support our custom oligonucleotide sales and snp genotyping services operations the remaining increase was due to personnel and other costs associated with our transition to a public company and to support our growth as well as higher legal costs 19 

 

   in connection with the grant of stock options and sale of restricted common stock to employees founders and directors through july 27 2000 we recorded deferred compensation of approximately 177 million we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation of 50 million and 54 million for the years ended december 30 2001 and december 31 2000 respectively we recorded an additional 03 million of expense related to restricted common stock sold to consultants which was expensed as our rights to repurchase the common stock lapsed and an additional 03 million charge for the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock during the year ended december 31 2000 in february 2000 we modified all our consultant agreements to include assurances that the contracts would be fulfilled in accordance with these modifications we recorded additional deferred compensation of 30 million as a component of stockholders’ equity and amortize this amount as a charge to operations ratably over the vesting periods of the restricted stock and options we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation of approximately 09 million and 08 million for the years ended december 30 2001 and december 31 2000 respectively 

 

   interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was 62 million and 47 million for the years ended december 30 2001 and december 31 2000 respectively interest income increased in 2001 due to higher average levels of invested funds partially offset by lower effective interest rates 

 

   interest expense was 07 million for the year ended december 30 2001 as compared to 01 million for the year ended december 31 2000 interest expense for the year ended december 30 2001 resulted primarily from a construction loan related to our new facility and from a loan arrangement for purchases of capital equipment liquidity and capital resources   as of december 29 2002 we had cash cash equivalents and investments including restricted cash and investments of 125 million of approximately 663 million we currently invest our funds in us dollar based investmentgrade corporate and government debt securities with average maturities of approximately 18 months   our operating activities used cash of 264 million in the year ended december 29 2002 as compared to 109 million in the year ended december 30 2001 the increase in cash used for operating activities was due primarily to an increase in our net loss for 2002 net of the noncash litigation judgment amortization of noncash charges and depreciation expense and the receipt of 50 million in research funding in 2001 which was recorded as deferred revenue   our investing activities used cash of 18 million in the year ended december 29 2002 as compared to 1017 million in the year ended december 30 2001 the decline in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to the reinvestment of our investment portfolio from cash equivalents to investment securities in 2001 this was partially offset by an 118 million increase in capital spending in 2002 that primarily relates to the purchase of a new facility   our financing activities provided cash of 261 million in the year ended december 29 2002 as compared to 07 million in the year ended december 30 2001 cash provided by financing activities in 2002 resulted primarily from 260 million in loan proceeds related to the purchase of our new facility   in october 1998 we entered into a 10 million capital equipment lease financing arrangement with a lease financing corporation as of december 31 1999 we had utilized all funds available under this lease agreement in april 2000 we entered into a 30 million loan arrangement to be used at our discretion to finance purchases of capital equipment 17 million of which remains available at december 29 2002 20   in july 2000 we entered into a 10year lease to rent space in two newly constructed buildings that we now occupy that lease contained an option to purchase the buildings together with eight acres of adjacent land that has been approved for construction of an additional building at the time the lease was executed we provided the developer with a 16 million letter of credit that was increased to 31 million in the third quarter of 2001 and which was secured by restricted cash in addition we provided the developer 62 million of funding in the form of an interest bearing secured loan with a term of approximately one year and a 05 million deposit in december 2000 we paid 23 million to execute the option to purchase the buildings and related land during the third quarter of 2001 the term of the secured loan expired and the principal and accrued interest thereon was applied to the purchase price for the project the purchase closed in january 2002 at which time the letter of credit was cancelled and we assumed a 260 million 10year mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 836 which calls for principal and interest payments of approximately 25 million per year until the loan expires in january 2012 at which time a balloon payment of 212 million will be due   in june 2002 we recorded a 77 million charge to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a terminationofemployment lawsuit as a result of the company’s decision to appeal the ruling we filed a surety bond with the court on october 25 2002 of 15 times the judgment amount or approximately 113 million under the terms of the bond we are required to maintain a letter of credit for 90 of the bond amount to secure the bond further the company was required to deposit approximately 125 million of marketable securities as collateral for the letter of credit and accordingly these funds will be restricted from use for corporate purposes until the appeal process is completed which we expect will occur within 12 to 18 months   at december 29 2002 the total of annual future minimum lease payments was 07 million under capital lease arrangements that span two years total future minimum principal and interest payments under the mortgage we assumed in january 2002 are 440 million representing payments of approximately 25 million per year for nine years with a balloon payment of 212 million due at the end of the 10year term   we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents investments and funding from existing strategic alliances and grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs for at least 18 to 24 months however our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors including scientific progress in our research and development programs the magnitude of those programs competing technological and market developments our ability to successfully commercialize our snp genotyping laboratory and extensions to that product and to expand our oligonucleotide and snp genotyping services product lines the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with applied biosystems and the successful resolution of our appeal in a termination of employment lawsuit therefore we may require additional funding within this time frame and the additional funding if needed may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all further any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights critical accounting policies   since our inception our activities have primarily consisted of research and development efforts related to developing our beadarray and oligator technologies accordingly the large majority of our transactions to date have related to research and development spending we expense all such expenditures in the period incurred bulk quantities of laboratory supplies and manufacturing raw materials are inventoried when acquired but expensed when placed in use for research activities   in 2001 we launched our commercial snp genotyping services product line and began to offer oligonucleotides for sale revenue for oligonucleotide sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer revenue for genotyping services is recognized generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered to the customer research revenue consists of amounts earned under research agreements with collaborators and government grants which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 21   we have one significant collaborative agreement under which we received nonrefundable research funding support of 100 million from applied biosystems through the end of 2001 all amounts received under that agreement were recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin “sab” 101 we will continue to reflect these payments as deferred revenue until the legal status of our collaborative agreement has been resolved   we invest our excess cash balances in marketable debt securities primarily government securities and corporate bonds and notes with strong credit ratings we classify our investments as “availableforsale” under sfas 115 and record such investments at the estimated fair value in the balance sheet with gains and losses if any reported in stockholders’ equity we periodically review our investments for other than temporary impairment recently issued accounting standards   in june 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 146 sfas 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” the principal difference between sfas 146 and issue 943 relates to the requirements under sfas 146 for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity sfas 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred under issue 943 a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue 943 was recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan the provisions of sfas 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 with early application encouraged we do not expect the adoption of sfas 146 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   in december 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” sfas no 148 amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results sfas no 148 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2002 the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december 15 2002 we have currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation if we should choose to adopt such a method its implementation pursuant to sfas no 148 could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations factors affecting our operating results   in addition to the items mentioned above the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 

 

   we have incurred net losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur net losses at december 29 2002 our accumulated deficit was approximately 904 million and we incurred a net loss of 403 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2002 we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future the magnitude of our net losses will depend in part on the rate of growth if any of our revenue and on the level of our expenses we expect to incur significant expenses for research and development for developing our manufacturing capabilities and for sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products in addition we expect to incur greater selling and marketing expenses in the 22 future as a result of the launch our snp genotyping system as a result we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we grow and consequently we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability even if we achieve profitability we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 

 

   we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease we are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and function namely snp genotyping gene expression profiling and proteomics these markets are new and emerging and they may not develop as we anticipate or reach their full potential other methods of analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing also researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and function if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not emerge in a timely manner demand for our products will not develop as we expect and we may never become profitable 

 

   we may not possess all of the resources capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all the products or services that may result from our technologies we currently do not sell our microarray or scanning instrument products although we expect to have such sales in early 2003 our technologies are in the early stages of commercialization or are still in development you should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting an early stage company developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries we must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale in addition we are only at the early phase of offering custom oligonucleotides and snp genotyping services problems frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services in addition we may need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of our products or services   historically life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a variety of technologies compared to the existing technologies our technologies are new and unproven in order to be successful our products must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for the largescale analysis of genetic variation and function   market acceptance will depend on many factors including  23 

 

   we have limited experience manufacturing our products in the volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales to date our manufacturing activities for arrays have been limited to supplying precommercial products for internal use and to support our snp genotyping services product line we have only recently begun manufacturing oligonucleotides for commercial sale and operating our internal snp genotyping service product line we are still in the process of optimizing our commercial manufacturing process for the scanning instrument that will be part of our snp genotyping system we currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use if a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services   the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources for example we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles included in our products from a single source if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of fiber optic bundles or other product components we will be unable to meet demand for our products we will need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercialscale production of our products or develop these capabilities internally and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms accordingly we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable highvolume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 

 

   we currently have limited sales and marketing and technical support services and have only recently established a small direct sales force in order to effectively commercialize our genotyping system and other products to follow we will need to expand our sales marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services in addition the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance required to support continued growth of our business 

 

   we expect to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans which will place a strain on our human and capital resources if we are unable to manage this growth effectively our losses could increase our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 

 

   our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad these problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights 24   the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries including our patent position generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets we will apply for patents covering our technologies and products as we deem appropriate however our applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies   in december 2002 applied biosystems filed but has not yet served us with a complaint alleging patent infringement against us asserting that our goldengate assay infringes several patents related to an applied biosystems assay method others may challenge or invalidate our patents or claim that we infringe the rights of third party patents also our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage we may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or litigate against third party claims which would be expensive and if we lose may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace   we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information these measures however may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees collaborators and consultants nevertheless employees collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets in addition others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 

 

   our commercial success depends in part on our noninfringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property applied biosystems filed but has not yet served us with a patent infringement suit against us and other third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization in addition third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims we may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing our patents against others furthermore parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief which effectively could block our ability to further develop commercialize and sell products and could result in the award of substantial damages against us in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost or at all in that event we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could prevent us from commercializing available products 

 

   we compete with life sciences companies that design manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and function and other applications using technologies such as twodimensional electrophoresis capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry flow cytometry microfluidics and mechanically deposited inkjet and photolithographic arrays we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards changes in customer needs 25 emerging competition and new product introductions one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical many of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources and more experience in research and development than we have furthermore the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies which are our potential customers and strategic partners could develop competing products if we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

 

   our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and services the need for capital expenditures to support and expand our business the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent research and development projects the filing prosecution and enforcement of patent claims and the success of our legal proceedings with applied biosystems and the appeal of a wrongful termination lawsuit we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for at least 18 to 24 months however we premise this expectation on our current operating plan which may change as a result of many factors consequently we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts in addition we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders   we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than an equipment lease line with 17 million unused and available as of december 29 2002 to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 

 

   we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology chemistry biological information processing sales marketing and technical support we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other biotechnology companies universities and research institutions particularly those focusing on genomics competition for these individuals particularly in the san diego area is intense and the turnover rate can be high failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies   our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies including the life sciences and healthcare industries thus we will need to add new personnel including management and develop the expertise of existing management the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 

 

   we have in the past and may in the future enter into collaborative agreements to assist in the development and commercialization of our technology we have limited or no control over the resources that any partner or collaborator may devote to our products any of our present or future partners or collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected these partners or collaborators may breach or terminate their 26 agreements with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations or perform their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner further any of our partners or collaborators may elect not to develop products arising out of our partnerships or collaborations or devote sufficient resources to the development manufacture or commercialization of these products if any of these events occur we may not be able to develop our technologies or commercialize our products and our ability to generate revenue will decrease 

 

   our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future these fluctuations in our operating results could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline a large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed including expenses for facilities equipment and personnel in addition we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly accordingly if revenue does not grow as anticipated we may not be able to reduce our operating losses   due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance for example our genotyping system sales cycle is lengthy the time period between our initial contact with a potential customer and installation is typically several months and includes site inspection training and the effective demonstration of the installed system accordingly revenues from system sales may occur in some quarters and not others oligonucleotide sales may fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on oligonucleotide needs for both our genotyping services product line and internal research in addition sales for all of our products and services may fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on market conditions our operating results may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors in that case our stock price probably would decline 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments   our equipment financings amounting to 06 million as of december 29 2002 are all at fixed rates and therefore have no exposure to changes in interest rates in january 2002 we assumed a 260 million mortgage in connection with the purchase of a new facility and related land the interest rate on this loan is fixed for a 10year period and consequently there is no exposure to increasing market interest rates   we have operated primarily in the united states we began our sales and marketing expansion into europe in the third quarter of 2002 other than employment related expenses for our european sales personnel virtually all transactions to date have been made in us dollars accordingly we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations nor do we have any foreign currency hedging instruments in place
