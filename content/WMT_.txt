 item 1a risk factors tableend

the risks described below could in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and liquidity our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally the following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face 

strategic risks 

failure to successfully execute our omnichannel strategy and the cost of our investments in ecommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance 

the retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate 

our strategy which includes investments in ecommerce technology talent supply chain automation acquisitions joint ventures store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our ecommerce business increase comparable sales maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings the success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omnichannel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall flywheel strategy the success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this item 1a  with the interconnected components of this flywheel strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other longlived assets in addition a greater concentration of ecommerce sales including increasing online grocery sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs which would in turn reduce the opportunities for crossstore or crossclub sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance 

furthermore the cost of certain investments in ecommerce technology talent automation including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the shortterm and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term 

if we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers demand for the products and services we sell our market share and the growth of our business 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive environment price transparency assortment of products customer experience convenience ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those related to esg issues and shopping patterns or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns 

could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers the demand for the products we sell or services we offer our market share and the growth of our business 

we face strong competition from other retailers wholesale club operators omnichannel retailers and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

each of our segments competes for customers employees digital prominence products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global physical ecommerce and omnichannel retailers wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising fulfillment and delivery services health and wellness and financial services the omnichannel retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving and the entry of new wellfunded competitors may increase competitive pressures in addition for ecommerce and other internetbased businesses newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us 

we compete in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omnichannel integration of our physical and digital operations 

a failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate omnichannel innovations and omnichannel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance see  item 1 business  above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments 

certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations whether due to bankruptcy consolidation or other factors such consolidation or other business combinations or alliances competitive omnichannel ecosystems or reductions in operations may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may materially adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions and other economic factors globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates lower or higher prices of petroleum products including crude oil natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel higher costs for electricity and other energy weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws other regulatory changes the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the us or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the us or such other markets change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets goodwill or other longlived assets 

in addition the economic factors listed above any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation labor insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

the economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

the performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

we may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business these arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could 

have achieved in the absence of such alliance in addition any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

operational risks 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial position and results of operations continues to be unpredictable and we may be unable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future 

the impacts of the covid19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and volatile in light of the potential for a resurgence of infection rates or as a result of future mutations variants or related strains of the virus recent years have demonstrated the widespread and varying impacts of the pandemic on certain business operations demand for our products and services instock positions costs of doing business access to inventory supply chain operations the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders business and government shutdowns and other restrictions on retailers our ability to predict future performance exposure to litigation and our financial performance among other things 

customer behaviors have changed rapidly during the course of the covid19 pandemic in the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations variants or related strains of the virus become prevalent customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change which may challenge our ability to anticipate andor adjust inventory levels to meet that demand these factors may result in higher outofstock positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products and could impact inventory levels in the future 

other factors and uncertainties include but are not limited to the severity and duration of the pandemic including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of covid19 cases future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate further increased operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates and recessionary pressures unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time capital and other resources to the pandemic response the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments for covid19 or other variants the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides and the longterm impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business including consumer behaviors these risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance 

the covid19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends and has particularly accelerated our ecommerce growth these results as well as those of other metrics such as net income and other financial and operating data may not be indicative of results for future periods once the impact of the covid19 pandemic subsides particularly as vaccines become more widely available and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to the aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below expectations 

to the extent that the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the us and the global economy it may also heighten other risks described in this section including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations competition our reputation implementation of strategic initiatives cybersecurity threats paymentrelated risks technology systems disruption supply chain disruptions labor availability and cost litigation and regulatory requirements 

natural disasters climate change geopolitical events global health epidemics or pandemics and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes tropical storms floods fires earthquakes tsunamis cyclones typhoons weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise geopolitical events global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and catastrophic events such as war civil unrest terrorist attacks or other acts of violence including active shooter situations such as those that have occurred in our us stores in countries in which we operate in which our suppliers are located or in other areas of the world such as in ukraine where armed hostilities currently exist between ukraine and russia could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers limitations on store or club operating hours the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings travel and movement limitations or otherwise and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability 

or economic sanctions increased transportation costs whether due to fuel prices fuel supply or otherwise the disruption whether directly or indirectly of critical infrastructure systems banking systems utility services or energy availability to our stores clubs and our facilities and the disruption in our communications with our stores clubs and our other facilities 

furthermore the longterm impacts of climate change whether involving physical risks such as extreme weather conditions drought or rising sea levels or transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes are expected to be widespread and unpredictable certain impacts of physical risk may include temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory and heat and extreme weather events that cause longterm disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which walmart operates relative to transition risk certain impacts may include changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climaterelated weather events prolonged climaterelated events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence stakeholder perception of our engagement in climaterelated policies and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs 

we bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to or destruction of any stores clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor safety anticorruption and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us 

political and economic instability as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control 

in addition the us foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

if the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations we could lose customers incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand reputation and financial performance we are also subject to reputational and other risks related to thirdparty sales on our digital platforms 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims as such any issue regarding the safety of any food or nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our brand reputation and financial performance in addition thirdparties sell goods on some of our digital platforms which we refer to as marketplace transactions whether laws related to these marketplace transactions apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position in addition we may face reputational financial and other risks including liability for thirdparty sales of goods that are controversial counterfeit pirated or stolen or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our ecommerce growth and flywheel strategy 

we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations 

given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical information systems our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security incidents and breaches through cyberattacks which may be from cybercriminals or sophisticated statesponsored threat actors catastrophic events such as fires major or extended winter storms tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes usage errors by our associates or contractors civil or political unrest or armed hostilities our information systems are essential to our business operations including the processing of transactions management of our associates facilities logistics inventories physical stores and clubs and our online operations our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if our systems are damaged breached attacked or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we frequently update our information technology hardware software processes and systems the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken if we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our omnichannel business globally could be materially adversely affected 

increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we use social media online advertising and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our omnichannel sales strategy we offer various pickup delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs omnichannel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world we must anticipate and meet our customers changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment any failure on our part to provide attractive userfriendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our digital platforms which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope and the systems on which they run including those applications and systems in our acquired ecommerce businesses are regularly subject to cyberattacks those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our ecommerce websites including marketplace platforms or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers or members information including payment information and related risks discussed in this item 1a  such attacks if successful in addition to potential data misuse andor loss may also create denials of service or otherwise disable degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers and members shopping experience our supply chain integrity and continuity and our ability to efficiently operate our business if we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters we could suffer loss of sales reductions in transactions reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business 

any failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company customers members associates and vendors whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation result in litigation or other legal actions against us cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results 

like most retailers we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members and we receive and store information concerning our associates and vendors some of that information is stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses in addition we and our thirdparty service providers store and maintain healthrelated personal information pharmacy and medical records in connection with our health and wellness and pharmacy business we also utilize thirdparty service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation for digital storage technology content delivery to customers and members backoffice support and other functions such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers members associates or 

vendors in addition our ecommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent attacks against information systems and devices whether our own or those of our thirdparty service providers create risk of cybersecurity incidents including ransomware malware phishing incidents we expect to continue to experience such attempted attacks in the future cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise we and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses phishing incidents worms bot attacks ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card and payment information and cause system failures and disruptions mitigation and remediation recommendations continue to evolve and addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us the increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the covid19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces some of our systems and thirdparty service providers systems have experienced security incidents or breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future 

associate error or malfeasance faulty password management social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our thirdparty service providers security measures and a compromise or breach of our or their information systems moreover hardware software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security 

any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged disclosed destroyed modified lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions including with respect to health information liability under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa customer attrition remediation expenses and claims from customers members associates vendors financial institutions payment card networks and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial position and results of operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security event breach vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs to the extent that any cyberattack ransomware or incursion in our or one of our thirdparty service providers information systems results in the loss damage misappropriation or other compromise of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others 

our compliance programs information technology and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk disruptions in our systems caused by security incidents breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with such as strategic partners suppliers banks or utility companies – could harm our ability to conduct our operations which may have a material effect on us may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners thirdparty service providers customers financial services firms and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis 

in addition such securityrelated events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers members associates vendors and shareholders could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our ecommerce operations and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our ecommerce operations as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations net sales results of operations financial position cash flows and liquidity such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards and our private label credit cards and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as payment network security operating guidelines and the payment card industry data security standard we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect cyberattacks cyberterrorism security incidents breaches or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future in certain circumstances our contracts with 

payment card processors and payment card networks such as visa mastercard american express and discover generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised which liabilities could be substantial 

additionally through various financial service partners we offer money transfers digital payment platforms bill payment money orders check cashing prepaid access cobranded credits cards installment lending and earned wage access these products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements including global antimoney laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions penalties and harm to our reputation 

the company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection use retention disclosure and transfer of personal information which include liability for security and privacy breaches among other obligations breaches may trigger obligations under federal and state laws to notify affected individuals government agencies and the media consequently cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation 

changes in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our walmart us and sams club segments as well as the recent addition of walmart health locations in a number of states which offer medical dental optometry immunizations and other health services a large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with thirdparty payers and payment administrators such as private insurers governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers pbms 

these operations are subject to numerous risks including reductions in the thirdparty reimbursement rates for drugs changes in our payer mix ie shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms changes in thirdparty payer drug formularies ie the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment growth in and our participation in or exclusion from pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by pbms andor any insurance plan or program increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking thirdparty reimbursement changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition changes in drug mix ie the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics changes in the health insurance market generally changes in the scope of or the elimination of medicare part d or medicaid drug programs increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home delivery options further consolidation and strategic alliances among thirdparty payers pbms or purchasers of drugs overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a thirdparty failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of thirdparty reimbursement may be subject changes in laws or regulations or the practices of thirdparty payers and pbms related to the use of thirdparty financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them and any additional changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act and other changes in laws rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business 

if the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies 

one or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of crossstore or crossclub selling opportunities and in turn adversely affect our overall net sales other results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices while 

controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations additionally our ability to successfully execute organizational changes including management transitions within the companys senior leadership and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or manage leadership transition successfully the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected 

in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

financial risks 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our consolidated net sales consolidated operating income capital expenditures comparable store and club sales growth rates ecommerce growth rates gross margin or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies changes in our effective tax rates changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or failure of walmarts performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations 

our operations in countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period in recent years fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations 

as a result of such translations fluctuations in currency exchange rates from periodtoperiod that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse periodoverperiod changes in our financial performance or reflecting a periodoverperiod improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit consequently unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations 

legal tax regulatory compliance reputational and other risks 

our international operations subject us to legislative judicial accounting legal regulatory tax political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance 

in addition to our us operations we operate our retail business in africa canada central america chile china india and mexico 

during fiscal 2022 our walmart international operations generated approximately 18 of our consolidated net sales walmart internationals operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions such as foreign ownership restrictions on ecommerce and retail operations in international markets such as india restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures antitrust and competition law regulatory matters such as the competition investigations currently 

underway in mexico related to our subsidiary walmart de mexico in canada related to our subsidiary walmart canada and competition proceedings in india related to our flipkart subsidiary local product safety and environmental laws tax regulations local labor laws antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future 

the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act or the laws and regulations of other countries we maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anticorruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation 

changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

in fiscal 2022 our walmart us and sams club operating segments generated approximately 82 of our consolidated net sales significant changes in tax and trade policies including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance a significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our us stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise whether imported directly or indirectly and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our us operations and our business 

we are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws tax rates regulations or accounting principles 

we are also exposed to future tax legislation as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws any of which can impact our current and future years tax provision the effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business financial position and results of operations in the us the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect us corporations as further guidance is issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance compliance with the tax act and any other new tax rules regulations guidance and interpretations including collecting information not regularly produced by the company or unexpected changes in our estimates may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations 

in addition legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules these changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes the impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate 

furthermore we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial 

statements and may materially affect our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made 

changes in andor failure to comply with other laws regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation market position or our business and financial performance 

we operate in complex regulated environments in the us and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations 

our operations in the us are subject to numerous federal state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements affecting our health and wellness operations the laws and regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including the health insurance portability and accountability act and the affordable care act laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration the fda and the drug enforcement administration the dea trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission the us department of the treasury and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer including through our digital channels and stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture antikickback laws antimoney laundering laws consumer financial protection laws the office of foreign assets control regulations false claims laws patient inducement regulations and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse quality and standards of medical equipment and the qualifications and practice of the professions of medical pharmacy optical care and health care services 

for example in the us the dea and various other regulatory authorities regulate the purchase distribution maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal and holding of controlled substances the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations in addition other healthrelated legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations also upon the successful completion of the previously announced pending acquisitions by our fintech joint venture there may be an increased degree of scrutiny by financial regulatory authorities over the newly acquired fintech related businesses which may result in higher operational costs and an increased possibility for fines and penalties if there is noncompliance with the applicable laws and regulations 

we are also governed by foreign national and state laws and regulations of general applicability including laws and regulations related to working conditions health and safety equal employment opportunity employee benefit and other labor and employment matters laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the us increasing governmental and societal attention to esg matters including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure topics such as climate change sustainability including with respect to our supply chain natural resources waste reduction energy human capital and risk oversight could expand the nature scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control assess and report in addition certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory requirements including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protections laws and us sanctions we are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection use retention disclosure transfer and processing of personal information such as the california consumer privacy act ccpa which was significantly modified by the california privacy rights act cpra new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in 2021 in virginia and colorado as well as the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr and chinas personal information protection act the potential effects of these laws are farreaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply in the case of noncompliance with a material provision of the gdpr such as nonadherence to the core principles of processing personal data regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4 of global annual turnover in the prior year these administrative fines are discretionary and based in each case on a multifactored approach residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have expanded rights to access correct and require deletion of their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa and cpra provide for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches furthermore our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the telephone consumer 

protection act we may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance including changing some portions of our business even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us 

the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation if we fail to respond adequately to changes including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives or do not respond as effectively as our competitors our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected 

while we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws they are subject to evolving regulations interpretations enforcement priorities of regulatory authorities and regulator discretion the regulatory political and media scrutiny we face which may continue amplifies these risks we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations to the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the us loss of licenses termination from contractual relationships including those with our drug suppliers and thirdparty payers and significant fines or monetary damages andor criminal and civil penalties failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment we are involved in legal proceedings including litigation arbitration and other claims and investigations inspections audits claims inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy healthcare tax environmental and other governmental authorities we may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested legal proceedings in general and securities derivative action and class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions andor involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years for example we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collectiveaction allegations or both in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws as well as a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws 

the company has also been responding to subpoenas information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled in re national prescription opiate litigation mdl no 2804 currently pending in the us district court for the northern district of ohio similar cases that name the company have also been filed in state courts by state local and tribal governments health care providers and other plaintiffs plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief including abatement on october 22 2020 the company filed a declaratory judgment action in the us district court for the eastern district of texas against the us department of justice the doj and the us drug enforcement administration asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the controlled substances act the csa the companys action was dismissed the company appealed this decision to the fifth circuit on december 22 2021 the fifth circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action on december 22 2020 the doj filed a civil complaint against the company in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging that the company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the csa the doj is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief the company filed a motion to dismiss the doj complaint on february 22 2021 since that time the district court stayed further proceedings in the doj complaint pending the decision of the united states supreme court in two other cases interpreting the csa which have been consolidated into ruan v united states  142 s ct 457 2021 

in addition the company is the subject of a consolidated securities class action alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the companys disclosures with respect to opioids filed in the us district court for the district of delaware on january 20 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired walmart stock from march 30 2016 through december 22 2020 on may 11 2021 the us district court in delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on october 8 2021 the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on january 10 2022 and the defendants filed their reply brief on february 10 2022 

two derivative actions were also filed by certain of the companys shareholders in the us district court for the district of delaware on february 9 2021 and april 16 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of the companys current and former directors with respect to oversight of the companys distribution and dispensing of opioids and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters 

other shareholders filed a third derivative action making similar allegations in the delaware court of chancery on september 27 2021 the defendants in this derivative suit filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on december 21 2021 and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on february 22 2022 

the company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters 

we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption  item 3 legal proceedings  and in note 10 in the  notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are part of this annual report on form 10k 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims discourage our shareholders from bringing claims or limit our shareholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers associates or shareholders in such capacity 

our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will to the fullest extent permitted by law be the sole and exclusive forum for claims including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director officer associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction upon the court of chancery the exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers associates or shareholders in such capacity which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons alternatively if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of the claims as to which they are intended to apply then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial position or results of operations while the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the securities act of 1933 as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder

throughout this item 7 we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club sales and other measures management measures the results of the companys segments using each segments operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations as well as other measures from time to time we revise the measurement of each segments operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker 

management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales or comparable sales a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmarts definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months including remodels relocations expansions and conversions as well as ecommerce sales we measure the ecommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally including omnichannel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the stores retail square feet of more than five percent sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months comparable sales are also referred to as samestore sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar into us dollars we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates additionally no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for nonusd acquisitions until owned for 12 months throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results including net sales and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future 

we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our walmart international portfolio for the longterm including the following highlights over the last three years 

• in november 2020 we completed the sale of walmart argentina and recorded a pretax noncash loss in fiscal 2021 of 10 billion primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses refer to note 12  

• in february 2021 we completed the sale of asda for net consideration of 96 billion for which we recognized an estimated pretax loss in fiscal 2021 of 55 billion and an incremental loss of 02 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction refer to note 11 and note 12  

• in march 2021 we completed the sale of seiyu for net consideration of 12 billion for which we recognized an estimated pretax loss in fiscal 2021 of 19 billion and an incremental loss of 02 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction refer to note 12  

we operate in the highly competitive omnichannel retail industry in all of the markets we serve we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets as well as ecommerce health and wellness financial services advertising and data service businesses many of these competitors are national regional or international chains or have a national or international omnichannel or ecommerce presence we compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to catastrophic events weather and other risks related to climate change global health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic competitive pressures consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability supply chain disruptions cost and availability of goods currency exchange rate fluctuations customer preferences deflation inflation fuel and energy prices 

general economic conditions insurance costs interest rates labor availability and costs tax rates the imposition of tariffs cybersecurity attacks and unemployment further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under  item 1a risk factors

company performance metrics 

we are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices supported by everyday low costs at times we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate we define our financial framework as 

• strong efficient growth 

• consistent operating discipline and 

• strategic capital allocation 

as we execute on this financial framework we believe our returns on capital will improve over time 

strong efficient growth 

our objective of prioritizing strong efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities increasing comparable store and club sales accelerating ecommerce sales growth and expanding omnichannel initiatives that complement our flywheel strategy while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs at times we make strategic investments which are focused on the longterm growth of the company 

comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar also known as the 454 calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases however when we discuss our comparable sales below we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar 

calendar comparable sales including the impact of fuel for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows 



comparable sales in the us including fuel increased 77 and 87 in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year walmart us comparable sales increased 64 and 87 in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively for fiscal 2022 comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket and transactions which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 average ticket increased while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets transaction growth turned positive in april 2021 and continued with strong growth through the rest of the year as customers prepandemic behaviors largely resumed for fiscal 2021 comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions related to the covid19 pandemic while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips walmart us ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 07 and 54 to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively as we continue to focus on a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers 

sams club comparable sales increased 150 and 87 in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively for fiscal 2022 sams club comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years the growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations sams club comparable sales for fiscal 2021 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the covid19 pandemic partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 13 and 22 to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively 

consistent operating discipline 

we operate with discipline by managing expenses optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve we invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity manage inventory and reduce costs we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating selling general and administrative operating expenses 



for fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental covid19 related costs of 25 billion as compared to the previous year partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the walmart us segment 

for fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales offset by 40 billion of incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic 

strategic capital allocation 

our strategy includes improving our customerfacing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers as such we continue to allocate more capital to supply chain omnichannel initiatives technology and store remodels and less to new store and club openings the following table provides additional detail 



returns 

as we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on assets return on investment and free cash flow metrics we also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 

return on assets and return on investment 

we include return on assets roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap and return on investment roi as metrics to assess returns on assets while roi is considered a nongaap financial measure management believes roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances longterm strategic initiatives with possible shortterm impacts roa was 56 for both fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively roi was 149 and 140 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively which increased primarily due to the increase in operating income 

we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period 

our calculation of roi is considered a nongaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi as mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain 

expense items and adds interest income and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial measure numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi 

the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



1 the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2 



free cash flow 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see  liquidity and capital resources  for discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of 242 billion 361 billion and 253 billion for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively we generated free cash flow of 111 billion 258 billion and 146 billion for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sellthrough in fiscal 2021 as well as timing and payment of wages free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities as well as 28 billion in increased capital expenditures net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sellthrough as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases incremental covid19 related expenses and certain benefit payments free cash flow for 

fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities as well as 04 billion in decreased capital expenditures 

walmarts definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows  

although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a nongaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 



1 net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow 

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 



1 unit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end and reflects the removal of stores in the uk and japan subsequent to closing the divestitures in fiscal 2022 permanently closed locations are not included 

our total revenues which includes net sales and membership and other income increased 136 billion or 24 and 352 billion or 67 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year these increases in revenues were primarily due to increases in net sales which increased 125 billion or 23 and 353 billion or 68 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2022 the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the walmart us and sams club segments which benefited from strong us consumer spending and some inflation along with positive comparable sales in most of our remaining international markets the increase was partially offset by a 326 billion net sales decrease primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the uk and japan which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 net sales also benefited from a 45 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2022 for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the walmart us and sams club segments as well as positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets resulting from increased demand stemming from the covid19 pandemic overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several international markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the covid19 pandemic the net sales increase was partially offset by a negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates of 50 billion 

our gross profit rate increased 14 and 20 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2022 the increase was primarily due to price management in the walmart us segment driven by cost 

inflation as well as merchandise mix partially offset by increased supply chain costs for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives strong sales in higher margin categories and fewer markdowns this was partially offset in the walmart us segment by carryover of prior year price investment as well as the temporary closure of our auto care centers and vision centers in response to the covid19 pandemic 

for fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental covid19 related costs of 25 billion as compared to the previous year partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the walmart us segment for fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales offset by 40 billion of incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic 

loss on extinguishment of debt was 24 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the early retirement of certain higher rate longterm debt to reduce interest expense in future periods 

other gains and losses consisted of a net loss of 30 billion and a net gain of 02 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively the loss in fiscal 2022 primarily reflects net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments as well as 04 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestiture of certain international operations which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the gain in fiscal 2021 primarily reflects 87 billion in net gains associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments partially offset by the 83 billion pretax loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021 

our effective income tax rate was 254 for fiscal 2022 333 for fiscal 2021 and 244 for fiscal 2020 the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 and the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the 83 billion loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021 which provided minimal realizable tax benefit our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our us operations and international operations which are subject to statutory rates that are generally higher than the us statutory rate the reconciliation from the us statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 is presented in note 9  

as a result of the factors discussed above we reported 139 billion and 137 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively which represents an increase of 02 billion and a decrease of 15 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year diluted net income per common share attributable to walmart eps was 487 475 and 519 for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

walmart us segment 



net sales for the walmart us segment increased 233 billion or 63 and 290 billion or 85 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 64 and 87 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively comparable sales in fiscal 2022 were driven by growth in average ticket and transactions which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 average ticket increased while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets transaction growth turned positive in april 2021 and continued with strong growth through the rest of the year as customers prepandemic behaviors largely resumed comparable sales in fiscal 2021 were driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions related to the covid19 pandemic while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips walmart us ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 07 and 54 to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively as we continue to focus on a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers 

gross profit rate increased 51 basis points for fiscal 2022 and was flat for fiscal 2021 when compared to the respective previous fiscal year the increase in fiscal 2022 gross profit rate was primarily due to price management driven by cost inflation as well merchandise mix which includes lapping the temporary closures of our auto care and vision centers and 

growth in our advertising business partially offset by increased supply chain costs gross profit rate for fiscal 2021 benefited from strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns but was offset by a change in merchandise mix the carryover effect of prior price investment and the temporary closure of our auto care and vision centers in response to the covid19 pandemic 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 31 basis points for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year despite the strong sales growth described above fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased primarily due to investments in wages partially offset by lower incremental covid19 related costs of 19 billion for fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 15 basis points primarily due to strong sales which were partially offset by 32 billion of incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic including special bonuses expanded sick and emergency leave pay costs associated with outfitting our stores and associates with masks gloves and sanitizer and expanded cleaning practices 

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 25 billion and increased 17 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year 

walmart international segment 



net sales for the walmart international segment decreased 204 billion or 168 and increased 12 billion or 10 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2022 the reduction in net sales was driven by a 326 billion decrease primarily related to the divestitures of asda and seiyu which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 this decrease was partially offset by positive comparable sales in most of our remaining markets as well as positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of 45 billion for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of 50 billion the pandemic led to significant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior including accelerated growth in ecommerce in several markets while several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of government mandates most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter of fiscal 2021 

gross profit rate decreased 55 basis points and increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2022 the decrease was primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to flipkarts improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the uk 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 71 basis points and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to impacts from the divested markets and 04 billion of lower incremental covid19 related costs operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the uk and japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to 05 billion of incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping a 04 billion noncash impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020 

operating income for fiscal 2022 included a 03 billion impact from positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates and fiscal 2021 included a 02 billion impact from negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 01 billion and 03 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year 

sams club segment 



1 we believe the excluding fuel information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the sams club segments fuel sales on its results of operations which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the sams club segment in the future management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment 

net sales for the sams club segment increased 96 billion or 151 and 51 billion or 87 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2022 the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth including fuel of 150 comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending which was aided by government stimulus and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years the growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 13 to comparable sales for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to comparable sales including fuel of 87 comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the covid19 pandemic partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 22 to comparable sales 

gross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2022 the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins cost inflation and higher supply chain costs partially offset by favorable sales mix including reduced tobacco sales for fiscal 2021  gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix including lower fuel and tobacco sales and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher ecommerce fulfillment costs 

membership and other income increased 131 and 68 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2022 the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased plus member penetration for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to growth in total members which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher plus member penetration 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from 02 billion of lower incremental covid19 related costs partially offset by reduced tobacco sales despite the increased sales growth described above fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to 03 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic which included additional costs such as special bonuses expanded cleaning practices and security expanded sick and emergency leave pay and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves additionally the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales 

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 04 billion and 03 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

the strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity our cash flows provided by operating activities supplemented with our longterm debt and shortterm borrowings have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the longterm growth of our operations generally some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations finance our global investment activities pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

net cash provided by operating activities 



net cash provided by operating activities was 242 billion 361 billion and 253 billion for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sellthrough in fiscal 2021 as well as timing and payment of wages the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sellthrough as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases incremental covid19 related expenses and certain benefit payments 

cash equivalents and working capital deficit 

cash and cash equivalents were 148 billion and 177 billion as of january 31 2022 and 2021 respectively our working capital deficit defined as total current assets less total current liabilities was 63 billion and 26 billion as of january 31 2022 and 2021 respectively we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases 

we use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible additionally from timetotime we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the us historically us taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of us tax reform repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes while we are currently evaluating recent regulations issued from the internal revenue service irs and the us treasury department we do not expect current local laws other existing limitations on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial position or results of operations 

as of january 31 2022 and 2021 cash and cash equivalents of 43 billion and 28 billion respectively may not be freely transferable to the us due to local laws or other restrictions of the 43 billion as of january 31 2022 approximately 22 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the flipkart minority shareholders however this cash is expected to be utilized by flipkart 

net cash used in investing activities 



net cash used in investing activities was 60 billion 101 billion and 91 billion for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively and generally consisted of capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities decreased 41 billion for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the net proceeds received from the divestitures of asda and seiyu partially offset by increased capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities increased 09 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in walmart canada and the change in other investing activities partially offset by decreased capital expenditures 

capital expenditures 

refer to the  strategic capital allocation  section in our company performance metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2022 and 2021 for the fiscal year ending january 31 2023 fiscal 2023 we project capital expenditures will be approximately 18 billion with a focus on supply chain automation customerfacing initiatives and technology 

net cash used in financing activities 



net cash from financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our shortterm and longterm debt financing obligations dividends paid and the repurchase of company stock transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities fiscal 2022 net cash used in financing activities increased 67 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year the increase is primarily due to repayments of longterm debt and related payment 

of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes as well as increased share repurchases partially offset by new longterm debt issuances in the current year and equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock fiscal 2021 net cash used in financing activities increased 18 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of longterm debt partially offset by both a reduction in cash used to pay down shortterm borrowings as well as share repurchases 

sale of subsidiary stoc k 

during fiscal 2022 the company received 32 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the companys majorityowned flipkart subsidiary which reduced the companys ownership from approximately 83 as of january 31 2021 to approximately 75 

shortterm borrowings 

we generally utilize the liquidity provided by shortterm borrowings to provide funding for our operations dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and other cash requirements the following table includes additional information related to the companys shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 



shortterm borrowings as of january 31 2022 and 2021 were 04 billion and 02 billion respectively with weightedaverage interest rates of 29 and 19 respectively we also have 150 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the us as of january 31 2022 that provide additional liquidity if needed additionally we maintain access to various credit facilities outside of the us to further support our walmart international segment operations as needed 

as of january 31 2022 we have 18 billion of syndicated and fronted letters of credit available of which 17 billion was drawn and represents an unrecorded current obligation 

longterm debt 

the following table provides the changes in our longterm debt for fiscal 2022 



our total outstanding longterm debt decreased 66 billion during fiscal 2022 primarily due to the extinguishment and maturities of certain longterm debt partially offset by the issuance of new longterm debt in september 2021 refer to note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for details on the maturities extinguishment and issuances of longterm debt the early extinguishment of certain longterm debt allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods in connection with this early extinguishment of debt the company paid premiums of 23 billion which represents the majority of the 24 billion loss recorded on the transaction during fiscal 2022 

estimated contractual interest payments associated with our longterm debt amount to 160 billion with approximately 13 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2023 estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of january 31 2022 and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate instruments 

dividends 

our total dividend payments were 62 billion 61 billion and 60 billion for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively effective february 17 2022 the board of directors approved the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of 224 per share an increase over the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of 220 per share for fiscal 2023 the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of 056 per share according to the following record and payable dates 



company share repurchase program 

from time to time the company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the companys board of directors all repurchases made prior to february 22 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022 on february 18 2021 the board of directors approved a new 200 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the company can make repurchases and beginning february 22 2021 replaced the previous share repurchase program as of january 31 2022 authorization for 106 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status 

we regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things current cash needs capacity for leverage cost of borrowings our results of operations and the market price of our common stock we anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the companys free cash flow in fiscal 2023 we plan to spend at least 10 billion in share repurchases 

the following table provides on a settlement date basis the number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 



material cash requirements 

material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases employee related costs taxes interest and other general operating expenses which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include shortterm borrowings longterm debt and related interest payments leases and purchase obligations see note 6 and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding outstanding shortterm borrowings and longterm debt and leases respectively 

as of january 31 2022 the company has 279 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding of which 93 billion is due within one year purchase obligations include legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases as well as commitments to make capital expenditures software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction contracts that specify the company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity are excluded from the obligations quantified above accordingly purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

capital resources 

we believe our cash flows from operations current cash position shortterm borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases 

we have strong commercial paper and longterm debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets as of january 31 2022 the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding longterm debt were as follows 



credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the general economic environment conditions in the retail industry our financial position including our total debt and capitalization and changes in our business strategy any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us in addition any downgrade of our current shortterm credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing the credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies

summary of critical accounting estimates 

management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing the companys consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates 

management continually reviews our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the lastin firstout lifo method for walmart us segments inventories the inventory at the sams club segment is valued using the weightedaverage cost lifo method when necessary we record a lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices as a measure of sensitivity a 1 increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory as of january 31 2022 and 2021 our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at firstin firstout fifo 

impairment of assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable managements judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance the evaluation of longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining the value of longlived assets is impaired resulting in a writedown of the related longlived assets impairment charges on assets held and used were immaterial in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 as a measure of sensitivity fiscal 2022 impairment would not change materially with a 10 decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment 

in fiscal 2021 the companys operations in argentina the united kingdom and japan met the held for sale criteria as a result the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value less costs to sell which resulted in impairment charges that were included in the total estimated pretax loss of 83 billion recorded in fiscal 2021 as well as 04 billion in incremental charges associated with the united kingdom and japan divestitures upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 refer to note 12  

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available for intangible assets acquired in a business combination we typically use the income method significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 

goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics as of january 31 2022 our reporting units consisted of walmart us walmart international and sams club goodwill and other indefinitelived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative marketbased approach historically our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value our indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted due to certain strategic restructuring decisions we recorded approximately 07 billion in impairment in fiscal 2020 related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software 

contingencies 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position results of operations or cash flows 

income taxes 

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions accordingly the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies increases and decreases in valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our us and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the us statutory rate and may fluctuate as a result 

our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies this evaluation relies on estimates 

as guidance is issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments 

the analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes the effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption in reality however a change in one factor could cause a change in another which may magnify or negate other sensitivities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps for fiscal 2022 the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased 02 billion primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for longterm debt the table represents the principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates for interest rate swaps the table represents the contractual cash flows and weightedaverage interest rates by the contractual maturity date unless otherwise noted the notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts the weightedaverage variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of january 31 2022 



1 includes deferred loan costs discounts fair value hedges foreignheld debt and secured debt 

as of january 31 2022 our variable rate borrowings including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps represented 22 of our total shortterm and longterm debt based on january 31 2022 debt levels a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately 01 billion 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than the us as well as our foreigncurrencydenominated longterm debt for fiscal 2022 movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the 06 billion net loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps the aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of 10 billion and 01 billion as of january 31 2022 and january 31 2021 respectively the change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain currencies in fiscal 2022 the hypothetical result of a uniform 10 weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of 10 billion a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of january 31 2022 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of 40 million 

in certain countries we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

investment risk 

we are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the stock price of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values the change in fair value is recorded within other gains and losses and resulted in a loss of 24 billion in fiscal 2022 due to net decreases in the stock price of those equity investments as of january 31 2022 the fair value of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values was 119 billion as of january 31 2022 a hypothetical 10 change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments by approximately 12 billion

operations historically many supercenters discount stores and neighborhood markets were generally open 24 hours each day in response to the covid19 pandemic we reduced store hours to allow for additional cleaning and sanitizing but expanded store hours slightly toward the end of fiscal 2021 consistent with its strategy walmart us continues to develop technology tools and services that help better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently such as pickup and delivery walmart shipfromstore and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omnichannel shopping experiences 

seasonal aspects of operations walmart uss business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays as well as different weather patterns historically its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending january 31 however the covid19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors that could result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business 

competition walmart us competes with omnichannel retailers operating discount department retail and wholesale grocers drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets hypermarkets and supercentertype stores as well as ecommerce retailers our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customercentric omnichannel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry we employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry these programs include the following

walmart internationals strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by walmart which means being locally relevant and customerfocused in each of the markets it operates we are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to reshape the portfolio to best enable longterm sustainable and profitable growth as such we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our walmart international portfolio for the longterm which include the following highlights over the last three years

merchandise the merchandising strategy for walmart international is similar to that of our operations in the us in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale while brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales we have both leveraged us private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality low priced items along with the private brands we market globally such as equate george great value holiday time mainstays marketside and parents choice our international markets have developed market specific brands including aurrera cambridge lider myntra and phonepe in addition we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices 

walmart international also offers fuel financial services and related products in various markets our businesses in mexico and canada for example offer prepaid cards and money wire transfers and our phonepe business in india provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment persontoperson p2p payment investment and insurance solutions financial services and advertising combined these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues 

operations the hours of operation for operating units in walmart international vary by country and by individual markets within countries depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation toward the beginning of the covid19 pandemic government mandates led to extensive store and operational closures in several of our international markets as well as limitations on certain merchandise sales in select markets while most closed stores and warehouses resumed operations by the end of fiscal 2021 store hours have been partially reduced or modified in several markets additionally several markets implemented enhanced safety and sanitization protocols as well as provided increased customer options and capacity for pickup and delivery services

 item 1a risk factors tableend

the risks described below could in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and liquidity our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally the following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face 

strategic risks 

failure to successfully execute our omnichannel strategy and the cost of our investments in ecommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance 

the retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate 

our strategy which includes investments in ecommerce technology acquisitions joint ventures store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our ecommerce business increase comparable store sales maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings the success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omnichannel shopping experience for our customers and is further subject to the related risks discussed in this item 1a  failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other longlived assets in addition a greater concentration of ecommerce sales including increasing online grocery sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs which would in turn reduce the opportunities for crossstore or crossclub sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance 

furthermore the cost of certain ecommerce and technology investments including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the shortterm and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term 

if we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers demand for the products and services we sell our market share and the growth of our business 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment price transparency assortment of products customer experience convenience ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those related to sustainability and shopping patterns or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers the demand for the products we sell or services we offer our market share and the growth of our business 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

each of our segments competes for customers employees digital prominence products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global physical ecommerce and omnichannel retailers wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries 

we compete in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omnichannel integration of our physical and digital operations 

a failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance see  item 1 business  above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments 

certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations whether due to bankruptcy consolidation or other factors such consolidation or other business combinations or alliances or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may materially adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions and other economic factors globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates lower or higher prices of petroleum products including crude oil natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel higher costs for electricity and other energy weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws other regulatory changes the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the us or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the us or such other markets change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets goodwill or other longlived assets 

in addition the economic factors listed above any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation labor insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

the economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

the performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

we may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business these arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance in addition any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

operational risks 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial position and results of operations is in many respects unpredictable and we may be unable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future 

the continuing impacts of the covid19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile with varying impacts on certain business operations demand for our products and services instock positions costs of doing business access to inventory supply chain operations our ability to predict future performance exposure to litigation and our financial performance among other things 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our domestic and international associates members suppliers and other people and entities with which we do business there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business and government shutdowns and other restrictions on retailers 

customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed which has challenged our ability to anticipate andor adjust inventory levels to meet that demand these factors have resulted in higher outofstock positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products and could impact inventory levels in the future 

other factors and uncertainties include but are not limited to the severity and duration of the pandemic including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of covid19 cases future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate further increased operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates and recessionary pressures unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time capital and other resources to the pandemic response the availability of and prevalence of access to effective medical treatments and vaccines for covid19 the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides and the longterm impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business including consumer behaviors these risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance 

the covid19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends and has particularly accelerated our ecommerce growth these results as well as those of other metrics such as net income and other financial and operating data may not be indicative of results for future periods once the impact of the covid19 pandemic subsides particularly as vaccines become more widely available and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to the aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below expectations 

to the extent that the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the us and the global economy it may also heighten other risks described in this section including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations competition our reputation implementation of strategic initiatives cybersecurity threats paymentrelated risks technology systems disruption supply chain disruptions labor availability and cost litigation and regulatory requirements 

natural disasters climate change geopolitical events global health epidemics or pandemics and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes tropical storms floods fires earthquakes tsunamis cyclones typhoons weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise geopolitical events global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and catastrophic events such as war civil unrest terrorist attacks or other acts of violence including active shooter situations such as those that have occurred in our us stores in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers limitations on store or club operating hours the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings travel and movement limitations or otherwise and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and the disruption in our communications with our stores 

furthermore the longterm impacts of climate change whether involving physical risks such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels or transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes are expected to be widespread and unpredictable these changes over time could affect for example the availability and cost of certain consumer products commodities and energy including utilities which in turn may impact our ability to procure those certain goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require 

we bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to or destruction of any stores clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor safety anticorruption and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us 

political and economic instability as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control 

in addition the us foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

if the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations we could lose customers incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand reputation and financial performance we are also subject to reputational and other risks related to thirdparty sales on our digital platforms 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims as such any issue regarding the safety of any food or nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our brand reputation and financial performance in addition thirdparties sell goods on some of our digital platforms which we refer to as marketplace transactions whether laws related to such sales apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position in addition we may face reputational financial and other risks including liability for thirdparty sales of goods that are controversial counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our ecommerce growth strategy 

we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations 

given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical information systems our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations including nation states catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates or contractors our information systems are essential to our business operations including the processing of transactions management of our associates facilities logistics inventories physical stores and clubs and our online operations our information systems are not 

fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if our systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken if we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our omnichannel business globally could be materially adversely affected 

increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we use social media online advertising and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our omnichannel sales strategy we offer various pickup delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs omnichannel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world we must anticipate and meet our customers changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment any failure on our part to provide attractive userfriendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our digital platforms which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope and the systems on which they run including those applications and systems in our acquired ecommerce businesses are regularly subject to cyberattacks those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our ecommerce websites including marketplace platforms or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers or members information including payment information and related risks discussed in this item 1a  such attacks if successful in addition to potential data misuse andor loss may also create denials of service or otherwise disable degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers and members shopping experience our supply chain integrity and continuity and our ability to efficiently operate our business if we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters we could suffer loss of sales reductions in transactions reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company customers members associates and vendors whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation result in litigation or other legal actions against us cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results 

like most retailers we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms we also utilize thirdparty service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation for digital storage technology content delivery to customers and members backoffice support and other functions such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers members associates or vendors in addition our ecommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise we and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses worms bot attacks ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card and payment information and cause system failures and disruptions the increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the covid19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces some of our systems and thirdparty service providers systems have experienced limited security breaches or incidents and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future 

associate error or malfeasance faulty password management social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our thirdparty service providers security measures and a breach of our or their information systems moreover hardware software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security 

any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged disclosed destroyed modified lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions customer attrition remediation expenses and claims from customers members associates vendors financial institutions payment card networks and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial position and results of operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security breach vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs to the extent that any cyberattack ransomware or incursion in our or one of our thirdparty service providers information systems results in the loss damage misappropriation or other compromise of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others 

our compliance programs information technology and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk disruptions in our systems caused by security breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with – could harm our ability to conduct our operations which may have a material effect on us may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners thirdparty service providers customers financial services firms and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis 

in addition such securityrelated events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers members associates vendors and shareholders could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our ecommerce operations and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our ecommerce operations as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations net sales results of operations financial position cash flows and liquidity such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards and our private label credit cards and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as payment network security operating guidelines and the payment card industry data security standard we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect cyberattacks cyberterrorism security breaches or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future in certain circumstances our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks such as visa mastercard american express and discover generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised which liabilities could be substantial 

additionally we offer money wire transfer services digital payment platforms bill payment money orders and check cashing and we sell prepaid cards and gift cards we further offer cobranded credit cards and installment loans through financial services partners these products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements including global antimoney laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions penalties and harm to our reputation 

the company also has compliance obligations associated with new privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection use retention disclosure and transfer of personal information which include statutory liability for security breaches consequently cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation 

changes in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our walmart us and sams club segments as well as the recent addition of walmart health centers in a number of states a large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with thirdparty payers and payment administrators such as private insurers governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers pbms 

our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks including reductions in the thirdparty reimbursement rates for drugs changes in our payer mix ie shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms changes in thirdparty payer drug formularies ie the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment growth in and our participation in or exclusion from pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by pbms andor any insurance plan or program increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking thirdparty reimbursement changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition changes in drug mix ie the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics changes in the health insurance market generally changes in the scope of or the elimination of medicare part d or medicaid drug programs increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home delivery options further consolidation and strategic alliances among thirdparty payers pbms or purchasers of drugs overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a thirdparty failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of thirdparty reimbursement may be subject changes in laws or regulations or the practices of thirdparty payers and pbms related to the use of thirdparty financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them and any additional changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act and other changes in laws rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business 

if the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies 

one or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of crossstore or crossclub selling opportunities and in turn adversely affect our overall net sales other results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations additionally our ability to successfully execute organizational changes including management transitions within the companys senior leadership and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or manage leadership transition successfully the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected 

in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

financial risks 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable store and club sales growth rates ecommerce growth rates gross margin or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or failure of walmarts performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations 

our operations in countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period in recent years fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations 

as a result of such translations fluctuations in currency exchange rates from periodtoperiod that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse periodoverperiod changes in our financial performance or reflecting a periodoverperiod improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit consequently unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations 

legal tax regulatory compliance reputational and other risks 

our international operations subject us to legislative judicial accounting legal regulatory tax political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance 

in addition to our us operations we operate our retail business in africa canada central america chile china india and mexico 

during fiscal 2021 our walmart international operations generated approximately 22 of our consolidated net sales walmart internationals operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions such as foreign ownership restrictions on ecommerce and retail operations in international markets such as india restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures antitrust and competition law regulatory matters such as the competition investigations currently underway in mexico related to our subsidiary walmart de mexico in canada related to our subsidiary walmart canada and competition proceedings in india related to our flipkart subsidiary local product safety and environmental laws tax regulations local labor laws antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future 

the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act or the laws and regulations of other countries we maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anticorruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation 

changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

in fiscal 2021 our walmart us and sams club operating segments generated approximately 78 of our consolidated net sales significant changes in tax and trade policies including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our financial performance a significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our us stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise whether imported directly or indirectly and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our us operations and our business 

we are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws tax rates regulations or accounting principles 

we are also exposed to future tax legislation as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws any of which can impact our current and future years tax provision the effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business financial position and results of operations in the us the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect us corporations and additional guidance from the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies is still pending as further guidance is issued by these taxing authorities any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance compliance with the tax act including collecting information not regularly produced by the company or unexpected changes in our estimates may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations 

in addition in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of covid19 legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules these changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes the impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate 

furthermore we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made 

changes in andor failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation market position or our business and financial performance 

we operate in complex regulated environments in the us and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations 

our operations in the us are subject to numerous federal state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements affecting our health and wellness operations the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including the health insurance portability and accountability act the affordable care act laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration the fda and the drug enforcement administration the dea trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer antikickback laws false claims laws patient inducement regulations and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy optical care and health care services 

for example in the us the dea and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal and holding of controlled substances the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

we are also governed by foreign national and state laws and regulations of general applicability including laws and regulations related to working conditions health and safety equal employment opportunity employee benefit and other labor and employment matters laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the us in addition certain financial services we offer or make available such as our money transfer agent services are subject to legal and regulatory requirements including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering sanctions fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protection we are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection use retention disclosure transfer and processing of personal information such as the california consumer protection act “ccpa” which was recently significantly modified by the california privacy rights act “cpra” as well as the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” the potential effects of these laws are farreaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply in the case of noncompliance with a material provision of the gdpr such as nonadherence to the core principles of processing personal data regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4 of global annual turnover in the prior year these administrative fines are discretionary and based in each case on a multifactored approach the ccpa and cpra give california residents expanded rights to access correct and require deletion of their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa and cpra provide for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches furthermore our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the telephone consumer protection act we may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance including changing some portions of our business even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us 

the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation 

while we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws they are subject to evolving regulations interpretations and regulator discretion to the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the us loss of licenses termination from contractual relationships including those with our drug suppliers and thirdparty payers and significant fines or monetary damages andor penalties in addition failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment we are involved in legal proceedings including litigation arbitration and other claims and investigations inspections audits claims inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy healthcare tax environmental and other governmental authorities we may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested legal proceedings in general and securities derivative action and class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions andor involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years for example we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collectiveaction allegations or both in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws as well as a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws 

the company has also been responding to subpoenas information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled in re national prescription opiate litigation mdl no 2804  currently pending in the us district court for the northern district of ohio similar cases that name the company have also been filed in state courts by state local and tribal governments health care providers and other plaintiffs plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief including abatement on october 22 2020 the company filed a declaratory judgment action in the us district court for the eastern district of texas against the us department of justice the “doj” and the us drug enforcement administration asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the controlled substances act the “csa” the company’s action was dismissed and the company is appealing the decision on december 22 2020 the doj filed a civil complaint against the company in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging that the company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the csa the doj is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief the company filed a motion to dismiss the doj complaint on february 22 2021 in addition the company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the company’s disclosures with respect to opioids filed in the us district court for the district of delaware on january 20 2021 and march 5 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired walmart stock from march 30 2016 through december 22 2020 a derivative action was also filed by one of the companys shareholders in the us district court for the district of delaware on february 9 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the company’s distribution and dispensing of opioids 

the company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters 

we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption  item 3 legal proceedings  and in note 10 in the  notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are part of this annual report on form 10k 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims discourage our shareholders from bringing claims or limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers associates or shareholders in such capacity 

our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will to the fullest extent permitted by law be the sole and exclusive forum for claims including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director officer associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction upon the court of chancery the exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers associates or shareholders in such capacity which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons alternatively if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of the claims as to which they are intended to apply then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial position or results of operations while the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the securities act of 1933 as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder

management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales or comparable sales a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmarts definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months including remodels relocations expansions and conversions as well as ecommerce sales we measure the ecommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally including omnichannel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the stores retail square feet of more than five percent sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months comparable sales are also referred to as samestore sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar into us dollars we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates additionally no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for nonusd acquisitions until owned for 12 months throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results including net sales and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future 

our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays as well as weather patterns generally our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending january 31 however the covid19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors that could result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business 

we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our walmart international portfolio for the longterm including the following highlights over the last three years 

• acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares or 77 percent of the diluted shares of flipkart private limited flipkart in august 2018 refer to note 12 for additional information on the transaction 

• divestiture of 80 percent of walmart brazil in august 2018 for which we recorded a pretax loss of 48 billion in fiscal 2019 refer to note 12 for additional information on the transaction 

• divestiture of banking operations in walmart chile and walmart canada in december 2018 and april 2019 respectively 

• in october 2020 we agreed to sell asda for net consideration of 94 billion and recognized an estimated noncash loss in fiscal 2021 of 57 billion after tax which includes the loss associated with the expected derecognition of the asda pension plan in february 2021 we completed the sale of asda refer to note 11 and note 12  

• in november 2020 we completed the sale of walmart argentina and recorded a noncash loss of 10 billion aftertax primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses refer to note 12  

• in november 2020 we agreed to sell a majority stake in seiyu for net consideration of approximately 12 billion and recognized an estimated noncash loss of 19 billion aftertax in fiscal 2021 in march 2021 we completed the sale of seiyu refer to note 12  

we operate in the highly competitive omnichannel retail industry in all of the markets we serve we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets as well as ecommerce businesses many of these competitors are national regional or international chains or have a national or international omnichannel or ecommerce presence we compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to catastrophic events weather global health epidemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic competitive pressures consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability cost of goods currency exchange rate fluctuations customer preferences deflation inflation fuel and energy prices general economic conditions insurance costs interest rates labor costs tax rates the imposition of tariffs cybersecurity attacks and unemployment further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under  item 1a risk factors  

covid19 updates 

throughout fiscal 2021 we have operated with a clear set of priorities to guide our decision making through the covid19 pandemic these priorities are 

• supporting our associates on the front lines in terms of their physical safety financial health and emotional wellbeing we are providing extra pay and benefits including special cash bonuses to associates and the introduction of a covid19 emergency leave policy in the us 

• serving our customers as safely as possible and keeping our supply chain operating we reduced our store operating hours at the onset of the covid19 pandemic and have expanded store hours slightly toward the end of the year 

• helping others which includes waiving or discounting rent for instore tenants in april and may 2020 as well as hiring more than 500000 new associates 

• managing the business well both operationally and financially and driving our longterm strategy we are maintaining our everyday lowprice discipline while investing in our omnichannel offering which continues to resonate with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience 

while we incurred incremental costs of 40 billion during fiscal 2021 associated with operating during a global health crisis the covid19 pandemic resulted in overall net sales growth during fiscal 2021 with strong comparable sales in the us and the majority of our international markets sales trends were positively affected by ecommerce growth acceleration and we also saw customers consolidate shopping trips and purchase larger baskets for a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment refer to  results of operations  below 

we expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the covid19 pandemic the duration and extent of economic stimulus timing and effectiveness of global vaccines and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which may impact our results 

company performance metrics 

we are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices supported by everyday low costs at times we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate we define our financial framework as 

• strong efficient growth 

• consistent operating discipline and 

• strategic capital allocation 

as we execute on this financial framework we believe our returns on capital will improve over time 

strong efficient growth 

our objective of prioritizing strong efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities increasing comparable store and club sales accelerating ecommerce sales growth and expanding omnichannel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs at times we make strategic investments which are focused on the longterm growth of the company 

comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar also known as the 454 calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases however when we discuss our comparable sales below we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar 

calendar comparable sales including the impact of fuel for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows 



comparable sales in the us including fuel increased 87 and 27 in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year walmart us comparable sales increased 87 and 29 in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively for fiscal 2021 comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by a decline in transactions as customers consolidated shopping trips for fiscal 2020 comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket and transactions walmart us ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 54 and 21 to comparable sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively as we continue to focus on a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers 

sams club comparable sales increased 87 and 16 in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively for fiscal 2021 sams club comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the covid19 pandemic partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales sams club comparable sales for fiscal 2020 benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales which were partially offset by lower average ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 22 and 18 to comparable sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively 

consistent operating discipline 

we operate with discipline by managing expenses optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve we invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity manage inventory and reduce costs we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating selling general and administrative operating expenses 



for fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales and lapping the 09 billion business restructuring charges from the prior year described below these benefits were offset by 40 billion of incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic and a 04 billion business restructuring charge in the walmart us segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 

for fiscal 2020 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points compared to the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales these improvements were partially offset by 09 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of noncash impairment charges for certain trade names acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the walmart us and walmart international segments 

strategic capital allocation 

our strategy includes improving our customerfacing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers as such we are allocating more capital to ecommerce technology supply chain and store remodels and less to new store and club openings total fiscal 2021 capital expenditures decreased slightly compared to the prior year the following table provides additional detail 



returns 

as we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on assets return on investment and free cash flow metrics we also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 

return on assets and return on investment 

we include return on assets roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap and return on investment roi as metrics to assess returns on assets while roi is considered a nongaap financial measure management believes roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances longterm strategic initiatives with possible shortterm impacts roa was 56 and 67 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in roa was primarily due to the losses on certain international operations held for sale or sold partially offset by the fair value change in our equity investments as well as the increase in operating income roi was 140 and 134 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in roi was primarily due to the increase in operating income 

we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period for fiscal 2020 lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of that balance sheet date rather than averaged because they are not directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 a twopoint average was used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021 after one full year from the date of adoption of asu 201602 leases  topic 842 asu 201602  

our calculation of roi is considered a nongaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi as mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial measure numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi 

the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 





1 the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by 2 average total assets as used in roa includes the average impact of the adoption of asu 201602  

2 for fiscal 2020 as a result of adopting asu 201602 average total assets is based on the average of total assets without leased assets net plus leased assets net as of january 31 2020 average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of january 31 2020

free cash flow 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company’s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see  liquidity and capital resources  for discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of 361 billion 253 billion and 278 billion for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we generated free cash flow of 258 billion 146 billion and 174 billion for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sellthrough as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases incremental covid19 related expenses and certain benefit payments free cash flow for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities as well as 04 billion in decreased capital expenditures net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the contribution to the asda pension plan in anticipation of its 

future settlement the inclusion of a full year of flipkart operations and the timing of vendor payments free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities as well as 04 billion in increased capital expenditures 

walmarts definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows  

although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a nongaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 



1 net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow 

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 



1 unit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end and includes stores associated with operations classified as held for sale as of january 31 2021 permanently closed locations are not included 

our total revenues which includes net sales and membership and other income increased 352 billion or 67 and 96 billion or 19 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year these increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales which increased 353 billion or 68 and 96 billion or 19 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the walmart us and sams club segments as well as positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets resulting from increased demand stemming from the covid19 pandemic overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several international markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the covid19 pandemic the net sales increase was partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of 50 billion for fiscal 2020 net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for walmart us and sams club segments along with the addition of net sales from flipkart which we acquired in august 2018 and positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets these increases were partially offset by 41 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in august 2018 

our gross profit rate increased 20 basis points and decreased 40 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives strong sales in higher margin categories and fewer markdowns this was partially offset in the walmart us segment by carryover of prior year price investment as well as the temporary closure of our auto care centers and vision centers in response to the 

covid19 pandemic for fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily due to price investment in the walmart us segment and the addition of flipkart in the walmart international segment partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the walmart us segment 

for fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales and lapping the 09 billion business restructuring charges from the prior year described below these benefits were offset by 40 billion of incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic and a 04 billion business restructuring charge in the walmart us segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 

for fiscal 2020 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales these improvements were partially offset by 09 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of noncash impairment charges for certain trade names acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the walmart us and walmart international segments 

other gains and losses consisted of net gains of 02 billion and 20 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the gain in fiscal 2021 primarily reflects 87 billion in net gains associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments partially offset by the 83 billion pretax loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021 the gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of a 19 billion increase in the market value of our investment in jdcom 

our effective income tax rate was 333 for fiscal 2021 244 for fiscal 2020 and 374 for fiscal 2019 the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for or sold in fiscal 2021 which provided minimal realizable tax benefit the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the fiscal 2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in walmart brazil which increased the previous comparative fiscal years effective tax rate as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our us operations and international operations which are subject to statutory rates that beginning in fiscal 2019 are generally higher than the us statutory rate the reconciliation from the us statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 is presented in note 9  

as a result of the factors discussed above we reported 137 billion and 152 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively which represents a decrease of 15 billion and an increase of 80 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year diluted net income per common share attributable to walmart eps was 475 519 and 226 for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

walmart us segment 



net sales for the walmart us segment increased 290 billion or 85 and 93 billion or 28 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 87 and 29 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively comparable sales in fiscal 2021 were driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions related to the covid19 pandemic while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips comparable sales in fiscal 2020 were driven by both average ticket and transaction growth for fiscal 2020 walmart us ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 54 and 21 to comparable sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively as we continue to focus on a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers 

gross profit rate was flat and decreased 14 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year while fiscal 2021 gross profit rate was flat it benefited from strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns offset by a change in merchandise mix the carryover effect of prior year price investment and the temporary closure of our auto care and vision centers in response to the covid19 pandemic for fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily the result of continued price investments which were partially offset by better merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 15 and 4 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year we leveraged operating expenses in fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of strong sales which were partially offset by 32 billion of incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic including special bonuses expanded sick and emergency leave pay costs associated with outfitting our stores and associates with masks gloves and sanitizer and expanded cleaning practices fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also slightly aided by lapping the 05 billion business restructuring charges from the prior year described below offset by a 04 billion business restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 resulting from changes to walmart us support teams to better support its omnichannel strategy the decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to strong sales and productivity improvements which were mostly offset by business restructuring charges of 05 billion consisting primarily of noncash impairment charges for certain trade names acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to decisions that resulted in the write down of certain ecommerce assets 

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 17 billion and decreased 6 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year 

walmart international segment 



net sales for the walmart international segment increased 12 billion or 10 and decreased 07 billion or 06 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of 50 billion the pandemic led to significant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior including accelerated growth in ecommerce in several markets while several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter as a result of government mandates most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter 

for fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of 41 billion as well as a reduction in sales due to our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in august 2018 offset by a full year of net sales from flipkart and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets 

gross profit rate increased 50 basis points and decreased 136 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to flipkarts improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the uk for fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily due to flipkart as well as a change in merchandise mix 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 14 basis points and decreased 13 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to 05 billion of incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping the impairment charges in the prior year discussed below fiscal 2020 decreased primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets as well as cost discipline across multiple markets partially offset by 04 billion in impairment charges primarily due to the writeoff of the carrying value of one of flipkarts two fashion trade names jabongcom as a result of a strategic decision to focus our efforts on a single fashion platform in order to simplify the business and customer proposition 

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 03 billion and decreased 15 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year 

sams club segment 



1 we believe the excluding fuel information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the sams club segments fuel sales on its results of operations which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the sams club segment in the future management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment 

net sales for the sams club segment increased 51 billion or 87 and 10 billion or 16 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year our 87 growth in comparable sales for fiscal 2021 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the covid19 pandemic partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 22 to comparable sales for fiscal 2020 the increase was primarily due to comparable sales including fuel of 16 comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 18 to comparable sales 

gross profit rate increased 65 basis points and decreased 11 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increase in gross profit rate was due to favorable sales mix including lower fuel and tobacco sales and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher ecommerce fulfillment costs for fiscal 2020  gross profit rate decreased due to price investment and higher ecommerce fulfillment costs partially offset by reduced tobacco sales 

membership and other income increased 68 and 47 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2021 and 2020 the increases were primarily due to growth in total members which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher plus member penetration fiscal 2021 growth was also positively affected by the covid19 pandemic fiscal 2020 was also benefited by gains on property sales and other income 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 42 and decreased 19 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year despite increased net sales from the strong demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to 03 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic which included additional costs such as special bonuses expanded cleaning practices and security expanded sick and emergency leave pay and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves additionally the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales for fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily the result of lower laborrelated costs and a charge of approximately 50 million related to lease exit costs in the prior comparable period these benefits were partially offset by a reduction in sales of tobacco and a higher level of technology investment 

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 03 billion and 01 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

the strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity our cash flows provided by operating activities supplemented with our longterm debt and shortterm borrowings have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the longterm growth of our operations generally some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations finance our global investment and expansion activities pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

net cash provided by operating activities 



net cash provided by operating activities was 361 billion 253 billion and 278 billion for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sellthrough as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases incremental covid19 related expenses and certain benefit payments the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 when compared to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to the contribution to our asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement the inclusion of a full year of flipkart operations and the timing of vendor payments 

cash equivalents and working capital deficit 

cash and cash equivalents were 177 billion and 95 billion as of january 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we maintained more cash at january 31 2021 compared to january 31 2020 in order to provide us with enhanced financial flexibility due to the uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic our working capital deficit defined as total current assets less total current liabilities was 26 billion and 160 billion as of january 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in working capital deficit as compared to the previous fiscal year is primarily driven by the increase in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase in current assets and current liabilities due to the classification of the companys operations in the uk and japan as held for sale we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases 

we use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible additionally from timetotime we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the us historically us taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of us tax reform repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes while we are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the internal revenue service irs and the us treasury department we do not expect current local laws other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial position or results of operations 

as of january 31 2021 and 2020 cash and cash equivalents of 28 billion and 23 billion respectively may not be freely transferable to the us due to local laws or other restrictions of the 28 billion as of january 31 2021 approximately 10 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the flipkart minority shareholders however this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of flipkart

net cash used in investing activities was 101 billion 91 billion and 240 billion for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our ecommerce capabilities invest in other technologies and supply chain remodel existing stores and clubs and add new stores and clubs net cash used in investing activities increased 09 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in walmart canada and the change in other investing activities partially offset by decreased capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities decreased 149 billion for fiscal 2020 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of the 138 billion payment for the acquisition of flipkart net of cash acquired as well as payments for other smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2019 

additionally refer to the  strategic capital allocation  section in our company performance metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2021 and 2020 

growth activities 

for the fiscal year ending january 31 2022 fiscal 2022 we project capital expenditures will be approximately 14 billion with a focus on supply chain automation customerfacing initiatives and technology 

net cash used in financing activities 



net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our shortterm and longterm debt financing obligations dividends paid and the repurchase of company stock transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities fiscal 2021 net cash used in financing activities increased 18 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the increase is primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of longterm debt partially offset by both a reduction in cash used to pay down shortterm borrowings as well as share repurchases as we manage our financial position during the current economic environment fiscal 2020 net cash used in financing activities increased 118 billion for fiscal 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the 159 billion of net proceeds received in fiscal 2019 from the issuance of longterm debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for flipkart partially offset by 55 billion of additional longterm debt in the fiscal 2020 to fund general business operations 

shortterm borrowings 

we generally utilize the liquidity provided by shortterm borrowings to provide funding for our operations dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and other cash requirements the following table includes additional information related to the companys shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



we also have 150 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the us as of january 31 2021 that provide additional liquidity if needed additionally we maintain access to various credit facilities outside of the us to further support our walmart international segment operations as needed 

longterm debt 

the following table provides the changes in our longterm debt for fiscal 2021 



dividends 

our total dividend payments were 61 billion 60 billion and 61 billion for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the board of directors approved effective february 18 2021 the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of 220 per share an increase over the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of 216 per share for fiscal 2022 the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of 055 per share according to the following record and payable dates 



company share repurchase program 

from time to time the company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the companys board of directors all repurchases made during fiscal 2021 were made under the 20 billion share repurchase program approved in october 2017 of which authorization for 30 billion of share repurchases remained as of january 31 2021 on february 18 2021 the board of directors approved a new 200 billion share repurchase program which beginning february 22 2021 replaced the previous share repurchase program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status 

we regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things current cash needs capacity for leverage cost of borrowings our results of operations and the market price of our common stock we anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the companys free cash flow the following table provides on a settlement date basis the number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



capital resources 

we believe cash flows from operations our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases 

we have strong commercial paper and longterm debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets as of january 31 2021 the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding longterm debt were as follows 



credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the general economic environment conditions in the retail industry our financial position including our total debt and capitalization and changes in our business strategy any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us in addition any downgrade of our current shortterm credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing the credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

contractual obligations

the expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations

summary of critical accounting estimates 

management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing the companys consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates 

management continually reviews our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the lastin firstout lifo method for walmart us segments inventories the inventory at the sams club segment is valued using the weightedaverage cost lifo method when necessary we record a lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices as a measure of sensitivity a 1 increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory as of january 31 2021 and 2020 our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at firstin firstout fifo 

impairment of assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable managements judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance the evaluation of longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining the value of longlived assets is impaired resulting in a writedown of the related longlived assets impairment charges on assets held and used were immaterial in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 as a measure of sensitivity fiscal 2021 impairment would not change materially with a 10 decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment 

in fiscal 2021 the companys operations in argentina japan and the united kingdom met the held for sale criteria as a result the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value less costs to sell which resulted in impairment charges that were included in the total estimated pretax loss of 83 billion recorded in fiscal 2021 refer to note 12  fiscal 2019 included a pretax loss of 48 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil which included full impairment of all related assets 

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available for intangible assets acquired in a business combination we typically use the income method significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 

goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics as of january 31 2021 our reporting units consisted of walmart us walmart international and sams club goodwill and other indefinitelived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative marketbased approach historically our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value our indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted due to certain strategic restructuring decisions we recorded approximately 07 billion in impairment in fiscal 2020 related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software 

contingencies 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

income taxes 

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions accordingly the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies increases and decreases in valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our us and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the us statutory rate and may fluctuate as a result 

our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies this evaluation relies on estimates 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted and contains significant changes to us income tax law effective beginning january 2018 the tax act reduced the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 and created new taxes on foreignsourced earnings and relatedparty payments as discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act in fiscal 2019 as further guidance is issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standard–setting bodies any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments 

the analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes the effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption in reality however a change in one factor could cause a change in another which may magnify or negate other sensitivities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps for fiscal 2021 the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased 69 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for longterm debt the table represents the principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates for interest rate swaps the table represents the contractual cash flows and weightedaverage interest rates by the contractual maturity date unless otherwise noted the notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts the weightedaverage variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of january 31 2021 



1 includes deferred loan costs discounts fair value hedges foreignheld debt and secured debt 

as of january 31 2021 our variable rate borrowings including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps represented 9 of our total shortterm and longterm debt based on january 31 2021 debt levels a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately 42 million 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the us as well as our foreigncurrencydenominated longterm debt for fiscal 2021 movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the 02 billion net gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps the aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of 83 million and 241 million as of january 31 2021 and january 31 2020 respectively the change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates primarily due to the strengthening of certain currencies relative to the us dollar in fiscal 2021 the hypothetical result of a uniform 10 weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of 524 million a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of january 31 2021 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of 46 million 

in addition to currency swaps we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreigncurrencydenominated longterm debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations we had outstanding longterm debt of £17 billion as of january 31 2021 and january 31 2020 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the uk as of january 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of 210 million in addition we had outstanding longterm debt of ¥100 billion as of january 31 2021 and ¥180 billion as of january 31 2020 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in japan as of january 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 change in value of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of 87 million as of january 31 2021 the companys operations in the uk and japan are classified as held for sale and subsequently closed in february 2021 and march 2021 respectively refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

in certain countries we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

investment risk 

we are exposed to changes in the stock price of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values the change in fair value is recorded within other gains and losses and resulted in a gain of 87 billion in fiscal 2021 due to net increases in the stock price of those equity investments as of january 31 2021 the fair value of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values was 144 billion as of january 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments by approximately 14 billion

the development of our company 

although walmart was incorporated in delaware in october 1969 the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when sam m walton opened a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport arkansas in 1946 his brother james l walton opened a similar store in versailles missouri until 1962 our founders business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores in that year the first walmart discount city which was a discount store opened in rogers arkansas in 1983 we opened our first sams club and in 1988 we opened our first supercenter in 1998 we opened our first walmart neighborhood market in 1991 we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in mexico since then our international presence has expanded and as of january 31 2020  our walmart international segment conducted business in 26 countries

risk factors 

tableend

the risks described below could in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally the following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face 

strategic risks 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may materially adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions and other economic factors globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates lower or higher prices of petroleum products including crude oil natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel higher costs for electricity and other energy weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws other regulatory changes the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the us or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the us or such other markets change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets goodwill or other longlived assets 

in addition the economic factors listed above any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation labor insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

the economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

each of our segments competes for customers employees digital prominence products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global ecommerce and omnichannel retailers wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries 

we compete in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omnichannel integration of our physical and digital operations 

a failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance see  item 1 business  above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments 

certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace other segments are substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions such consolidation or other business combinations or alliances or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers demand for the products and services we sell our market share and the growth of our business 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment price transparency assortment of products customer experience convenience ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the products we sell or services we offer our market share and the growth of our business 

failure to successfully execute our omnichannel strategy and the cost of our investments in ecommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance 

the retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate 

our strategy which includes investments in ecommerce technology acquisitions joint ventures store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our ecommerce business increase comparable store sales maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings the success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omnichannel shopping experience for our customers and is further subject to the related risks discussed in this item 1a  failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other longlived assets in addition a greater concentration of ecommerce sales including increasing online grocery sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs which would in turn reduce the opportunities for crossstore or crossclub sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance 

furthermore the cost of certain ecommerce and technology investments including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the shortterm and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term 

the performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

we may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail operations these arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance in addition any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance or business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

operational risks 

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes tropical storms floods fires earthquakes tsunamis cyclones typhoons weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate geopolitical events global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the recent coronavirus covid19 outbreak and catastrophic events such as war civil unrest terrorist attacks or other acts of violence including active shooter situations such as those that have occurred in our us stores in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities limitations on store or club operating hours the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings travel and movement limitations or otherwise and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and the disruption in our communications with our stores for example our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by riots and looting in chile which resulted in us closing a number of our stores until the disruption abated 

we bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to or destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor safety anticorruption and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us 

political and economic instability as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located such as the recent coronavirus outbreak which could result in potential disruptions or delays to our global supply chain the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control 

in addition the us foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

if the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations we could lose customers incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand reputation and financial performance we are also subject to reputational and other risks related to thirdparty sales on our digital platforms 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims as such any issue regarding the safety of any food or nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our brand reputation and financial performance in addition 

thirdparties sell goods on some of our digital platforms which we refer to as marketplace transactions whether laws related to such sales apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position in addition we may face reputational financial and other risks including liability for thirdparty sales of goods that are controversial counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our ecommerce growth strategy 

we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations 

given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical information systems our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations including nation states catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates or contractors our information systems are essential to our business operations including the processing of transactions management of our associates facilities logistics inventories physical stores and clubs and our online operations our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if our systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken if we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our omnichannel business globally could be materially adversely affected 

increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we use social media online advertising and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our omnichannel sales strategy in addition to home delivery we offer various pickup and delivery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs omnichannel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world we must anticipate and meet our customers changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment any failure on our part to provide attractive userfriendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our digital platforms which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope and the systems on which they run including those applications and systems in our acquired ecommerce businesses are regularly subject to cyberattacks those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our ecommerce websites including marketplace platforms or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers or members information including payment information and related risks discussed in this item 1a such attacks if successful in addition to potential data misuse may also create denials of service or otherwise disable degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers and members shopping experience if we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters we could suffer loss of sales reductions in transactions reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company customers members associates and vendors whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation result in litigation or other legal actions against us cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results 

like most retailers we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms we also utilize thirdparty service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation for digital storage technology content delivery to customers and members backoffice support and other functions such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers members associates or vendors in addition our ecommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise we and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card information and cause system failures and disruptions some of our systems have experienced limited security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future 

associate error or malfeasance faulty password management social engineering or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our thirdparty service providers security measures and a breach of our or their information systems moreover hardware software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security 

any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged modified lost or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions customer attrition remediation expenses and claims from customers members associates vendors financial institutions payment card networks and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security breach vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs 

in addition such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers members associates vendors and shareholders could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our ecommerce operations and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our ecommerce operations as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations net sales results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security compromise could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards and our private label credit cards and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as payment network security operating guidelines and the payment card industry data security standard we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect cyberattacks cyber terrorism security breaches or other compromises from known malware or other threats that may be developed in the future to the extent that any cyberattack or incursion in our or one of our thirdparty service providers information systems results in the loss damage misappropriation or other compromise of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks such as visa mastercard american express and discover generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised which liabilities could be substantial 

additionally we offer money wire transfer services digital payment platforms bill payment money orders and check cashing and we sell prepaid cards and gift cards we further offer cobranded credit cards and installment loans through financial services partners these products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements including global antimoney laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions penalties and harm to our reputation 

the company also has compliance obligations associated with new privacy laws enacted to protect personal information the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ccpa grants california consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection use and sharing of “personal information” of california consumers other us states are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal information and the us federal government is also considering federal privacy legislation outside the us the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation “gdpr” greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur additional costs and expenses if we fail to comply with ccpa gdpr or other privacy related regulations or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with them it could lead to regulatory enforcement action monetary fines or penalties up to 4 of worldwide revenue in the case of gdpr lawsuits or reputational damage and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our walmart us and sams club segments as well as the recent addition of walmart health centers to some of our us stores a large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with thirdparty payers and payment administrators such as private insurers governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers pbms 

our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks including reductions in the thirdparty reimbursement rates for drugs changes in our payer mix ie shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms changes in thirdparty payer drug formularies ie the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment growth in and our participation in or exclusion from exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by pbms andor any insurance plan or program increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking thirdparty reimbursement changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition changes in drug mix ie the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics changes in the health insurance market generally changes in the scope of or the elimination of medicare part d or medicaid drug programs increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations further consolidation and strategic alliances among thirdparty payers pbms or purchasers of drugs overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a thirdparty failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of thirdparty reimbursement may be subject and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act and other changes in laws rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business 

if the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies 

one or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of crossstore or crossclub selling opportunities and in turn adversely affect our overall net sales other results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs distribution centers and corporate offices while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised 

employment and labor laws and regulations additionally our ability to successfully execute organizational changes including management transitions within the companys senior leadership such as our recent leadership changes and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or manage leadership transition successfully the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected 

in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

financial risks 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations 

our operations in countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period in recent years fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations 

as a result of such translations fluctuations in currency exchange rates from periodtoperiod that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse periodoverperiod changes in our financial performance or reflecting a periodoverperiod improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit consequently unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable store and club sales growth rates ecommerce growth rates gross margin or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies additionally failure of walmarts performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock 

legal tax regulatory compliance reputational and other risks 

our international operations subject us to legislative judicial accounting legal regulatory tax political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance 

in addition to our us operations we operate our retail business in africa argentina canada central america chile china india japan mexico and the united kingdom 

during fiscal 2020 our walmart international operations generated approximately 23 of our consolidated net sales walmart internationals operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions such as foreign ownership restrictions on ecommerce and retail operations in international markets such as india restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures local product safety and environmental laws tax regulations local labor laws antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future 

for example during the current transition period following the uk’s recent exit from the european union we face continued uncertainty regarding the impact on our uk business of potential changes in tariffs trade practices and other regulations while the uk and eu work to put in place alternative trade and other arrangements 

the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anticorruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation 

changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

in fiscal 2020 our walmart us and sams club operating segments generated approximately 77 of our consolidated net sales the federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us a significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our us stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise whether imported directly or indirectly and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our us operations and our business 

we are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws tax rates regulations or accounting principles 

for example in december 2019 india enacted a bill which significantly reduced the corporate income tax for certain companies with operations in india in the us the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act significantly changed income tax laws that affect us corporations with additional guidance from the us tax authority still pending as further guidance is issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance compliance with the tax act including collecting information not regularly produced by the company or unexpected changes in our estimates may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made 

changes in andor failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation market position or our business and financial performance 

we operate in complex regulated environments in the us and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations 

our pharmacy and other healthcare operations in the us are subject to numerous federal state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including the health insurance portability and accountability act the affordable care act laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration the fda and the drug enforcement administration the dea trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer antikickback laws false claims laws and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy optical care and nurse practitioner services 

for example in the us the dea and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal and holding of controlled substances the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

we are also governed by foreign national and state laws and regulations of general applicability including laws and regulations related to working conditions health and safety equal employment opportunity employee benefit and other labor and employment matters laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the us in addition certain financial services we offer or make available such as our money transfer agent services are subject to legal and regulatory requirements including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering sanctions fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protection the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer 

untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the us loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary damages andor penalties in addition failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation in particular we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws as well as a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws 

in addition asda stores ltd asda a whollyowned subsidiary of the company has been named as a defendant in numerous equal value claims pending in the manchester employment tribunal the employment tribunal in the united kingdom the claimants who are current and former asda store employees allege that the work performed by employees in asdas retail stores is of equal value in terms of among other things the demands of their jobs to that of employees working in asdas warehouses and distribution facilities and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities and that the pay difference is not objectively justified the claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis at present we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters  

the company has been responding to subpoenas information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled in re national prescription opiate litigation mdl no 2804  currently pending in the us district court for the northern district of ohio similar cases that name the company have also been filed in state courts by state local and tribal governments health care providers and other plaintiffs plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief including abatement the company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters 

we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption  item 3 legal proceedings  and in note 10 in the  notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are part of this annual report on form 10k 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers employees or shareholders in such capacity 

our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will to the fullest extent permitted by law be the sole and exclusive forum for claims including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director officer employee or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction upon the court of chancery this exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers employees or shareholders in such capacity which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons alternatively if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of the claims as to which they are intended to apply then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

throughout this item 7 we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club sales and other measures management measures the results of the companys segments using each segments operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations as well as other measures from time to time we revise the measurement of each segments operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker 

management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales or comparable sales a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmarts definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months including remodels relocations expansions and conversions as well as ecommerce sales we measure the ecommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications including omnichannel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the stores retail square feet of more than five percent additionally sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months comparable sales are also referred to as samestore sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic a component along with ticket of comparable sales traffic is now referred to as transactions and measures a percentage change in the number of sales transactions in our comparable stores as well as for comparable ecommerce activity 

in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar into us dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates additionally no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for nonusd acquisitions until owned for 12 months throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results including net sales and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future 

our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays as well as weather patterns generally our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending january 31  

we have taken strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio for the longterm including

comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar also known as the 454 calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases however when we discuss our comparable sales below we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar

walmart us comparable sales increased 29 and 37 in fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively driven by ticket and transactions growth walmart us ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 17 and 13 to comparable sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively as we continue to focus on a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers  sams club comparable sales increased 16 and 54 in fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively sams club comparable sales for both fiscal 2020 and 2019 benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations sams club fiscal 2019 comparable sales were further aided by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 15 and 09 to comparable sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively 

consistent operating discipline 

we operate with discipline by managing expenses optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve we invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity manage inventory and reduce costs we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating selling general and administrative expenses 



for fiscal 2020  operating selling general and administrative operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales these improvements were partially offset by 09 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of noncash impairment charges for certain trade names acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the walmart us and walmart international segments 

for fiscal 2019 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year the primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping of certain fiscal 2018 charges the improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in ecommerce and technology as well as a 160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit 

strategic capital allocation 

our strategy includes improving our customerfacing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers as such we are allocating more capital to ecommerce technology supply chain and store remodels and less to new store and club openings when compared to prior years total fiscal 2020 capital expenditures increased slightly compared to the prior year the following table provides additional detail 



returns 

as we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on assets return on investment and free cash flow metrics we also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 

return on assets and return on investment 

we include return on assets roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap and return on investment roi as metrics to assess returns on assets while roi is considered a nongaap financial measure management believes roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances longterm strategic initiatives with possible shortterm impacts roa was 67 and 34 for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively the increase in roa was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily due to the change in fair value of the investment in jdcom and lapping the 45 billion net loss recorded in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil partially offset by the dilution to operating income related to flipkart roi was 134 and 142 for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively the decrease in roi was due to the decrease in operating income primarily as a result of the dilution from flipkart as well as business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020 the denominator remained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of asu 201602 leases asu 201602 since operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets 

we define roi as operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period upon adoption of asu 201602 rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of roi on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized for fiscal 2020 lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date rather than averaged because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 a twopoint average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021 after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard further beginning prospectively in fiscal 2020 rent expense in the numerator excludes shortterm and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease right of use asset balance 

prior to adoption of asu 201602 we defined roi as operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period we considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases because the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of february 1 2019 our calculation of roi for fiscal 2019 was not revised 

our calculation of roi is considered a nongaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi as mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial measure numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi 

the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



1 the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by 2 average total assets as used in roa includes the average impact of the adoption of asu 201602 

2 for fiscal 2020 as a result of adopting asu 201602 average total assets is based on the average of total assets without leased assets net plus leased assets net as of january 31 2020 average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of january 31 2020

free cash flow 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital resources for discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of 253 billion  278 billion and 283 billion for fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively we generated free cash flow of 146 billion  174 billion and 183 billion for fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the contribution to our asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement the inclusion of a full year of flipkart operations and the timing of vendor payments free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities as well as 04 billion in increased capital expenditures  net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from the tax act and the timing of tax payments free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities as well as 03 billion in increased capital expenditures 

walmarts definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows  

although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a nongaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 



1 net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow 

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 



1 unit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end permanently closed locations are not included 

our total revenues which includes net sales and membership and other income increased 96 billion or 19 and 141 billion or 28 for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year these increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales which increased 96 billion or 19 and 146 billion or 29 for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2020  net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for walmart us and sams club segments along with the addition of net sales from flipkart which we acquired in august 2018 and positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets these increases were partially offset by 41 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in august 2018 for fiscal 2019  net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for walmart us and sams club segments along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets and net sales from flipkart which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 additionally for fiscal 2019 the increase in net sales was partially offset by a 45 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the sams club segment during fiscal 2018 a 31 billion reduction in net sales due to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in the international segment and 07 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

our gross profit rate decreased 40 and 18 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2020  these decreases were primarily due to price investment in the walmart us segment and the addition of flipkart in the walmart international segment partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the walmart us segment for fiscal 2019  the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing ecommerce business the acquisition of flipkart our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses 

for fiscal 2020  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales these improvements were partially offset by 09 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of noncash impairment charges for certain trade names acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the walmart us and walmart international segments 

for fiscal 2019 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year the primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping approximately 18 billion in certain charges in fiscal 2018 the improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in ecommerce and technology as well as a 02 billion charge related to a securities class action lawsuit 

other gains and losses consisted of a gain of 20 billion for fiscal 2020 and a loss of 84 billion for fiscal 2019  the gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of a 19 billion increase in the market value of our investment in jdcom the loss in fiscal 2019 is primarily the result of the 48 billion pretax loss on the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil and a 35 billion decrease in the market value of our investment in jdcom fiscal 2018 results included loss on extinguishment of debt of 31 billion 

our effective income tax rate was 244 for fiscal 2020  374 for fiscal 2019  and 304 for fiscal 2018  the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the fiscal 2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in walmart brazil which increased the comparative periods effective tax rate as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the aforementioned loss on sale of a majority stake in walmart brazil and flipkarts results additionally our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our us operations and international operations which are subject to statutory rates that beginning in fiscal 2019 are generally higher than the us statutory rate the reconciliation from the us statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018 is presented in note 9 to our notes to consolidated financial statements  

as a result of the factors discussed above we reported 152 billion and 72 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively which represents an increase of 80 billion and a decrease of 33 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year diluted net income per common share attributable to walmart eps was 519  226 and 328 for fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively 

walmart us segment 



net sales for the walmart us segment increased 93 billion or 28 and 132 billion or 41 for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 29 and 37 for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively driven by ticket and transaction growth walmart us ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 17 and 13 to comparable sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019  

gross profit rate decreased 14 and 28 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2020  the decreases were primarily the result of continued price investments which were partially offset by better merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs for fiscal 2019  the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy increased transportation expenses and the mix effects from our growing ecommerce business 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 4 basis points for fiscal 2020 and decreased 23 basis points for fiscal 2019  when compared to the previous fiscal year we leveraged operating expenses in fiscal 2020 as a result of strong sales and productivity improvements which were mostly offset by business restructuring charges of 05 billion consisting primarily of noncash impairment charges for certain trade names acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to decisions that resulted in the write down of certain ecommerce assets the decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and the prior year comparable period including charges related to discontinued real estate projects of 02 billion these improvements more than offset investments in ecommerce technology and omnichannel initiatives and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal 2019 

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income decreased 6 million and increased 391 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year 

walmart international segment 



net sales for the walmart international segment decreased 07 billion or 06 and increased 28 billion or 23 for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2020  the decrease was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of 41 billion as well as a reduction in sales due to our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in august 2018 offset by a full year of net sales from flipkart and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets 

for fiscal 2019  the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from flipkart which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 these increases were partially offset by a 31 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil a 07 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates the continued wind down of our first party brazil ecommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of 140 million due to divesting our suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 

gross profit rate decreased 136 and 41 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2020  the decrease was primarily due to flipkart as well as a change in merchandise mix for fiscal 2019  the decrease was due to flipkart and strategic price investments in certain markets 

membership and other income decreased 11 and 224 for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to currency while fiscal 2019 decreased due to the prior year recognition of a 387 million gain from the sale of suburbia 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 13 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 37 basis points for 2019  when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and cost discipline across multiple markets partially offset by 04 billion in impairment charges which was due primarily to the writeoff of the carrying value of one of flipkarts two fashion trade names jabongcom as a result of a strategic decision to focus our efforts on a single fashion platform in order to simplify the business and customer proposition fiscal 2019 decreased primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately 05 billion which included charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party brazil ecommerce operations this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from flipkart in fiscal 2019 

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income decreased 15 billion and 03 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively 

sams club segment 



1 we believe the excluding fuel information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the sams club segments fuel sales on its results of operations which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the sams club segment in the future management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment 

net sales for the sams club segment increased 10 billion or 16 for fiscal 2020 and decreased 14 billion or 23 for fiscal 2019  when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2020  the increases were primarily due to comparable sales including fuel of 16  comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 15 to comparable sales for fiscal 2019  the decrease was primarily due to a 45 billion decrease in net sales resulting from the net closure of 63 clubs during fiscal 2018 as well as reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations these decreases were partially offset by increases in comparable sales which were benefited by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 09 to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 additional fuel sales of 07 billion partially offset the decreases in net sales for fiscal 2019 

gross profit rate decreased 11 basis points for fiscal 2020 and remained relatively flat for fiscal 2019  when compared to the previous fiscal year the gross profit rate decreased due to investments in price and higher ecommerce fulfillment costs partially offset by reduced tobacco sales which have lower margins for fiscal 2019  gross profit rate was benefited by lapping the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures in fiscal 2018 and decreased tobacco sales in fiscal 2019 this benefit to the gross profit rate was offset by higher transportation costs and ecommerce shipping costs investments in price and increased shrink in fiscal 2019 

membership and other income increased 47 and 26 for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2020  the increase was primarily due to growth in total members which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher plus member penetration along with gains on property sales and other income for fiscal 2019  the increase was due to an increase of 15 in membership income resulting from increased plus member penetration and gains on property sales these increases were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous fiscal year 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 19 and 99 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2020  the decrease was primarily the result of lower laborrelated costs and a charge of approximately 50 million related to lease exit costs in the prior comparable period these benefits were partially offset by a reduction in sales of tobacco and a higher level of technology investment for fiscal 2019  the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately 06 billion in the prior years comparable period related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects 

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 122 million for fiscal 2020 and increased 605 million f or fiscal 2019  when compared to the previous fiscal year 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

the strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity our cash flows provided by operating activities supplemented with our longterm debt and shortterm borrowings have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the longterm growth of our operations generally some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations finance our global investment and expansion activities pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

net cash provided by operating activities 



net cash provided by operating activities was 253 billion  278 billion and 283 billion for fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the contribution to our asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement the inclusion of a full year of flipkart operations and the timing of vendor payments the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019  when compared to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to timing of vendor payments partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from tax reform and the timing of tax payments 

cash equivalents and working capital deficit 

cash and cash equivalents were 95 billion and 77 billion as of january 31 2020 and 2019  respectively our working capital deficit defined as total current assets less total current liabilities was 160 billion and 156 billion as of january 31 2020 and 2019  respectively we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases 

we use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible additionally from timetotime we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the us historically us taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of us tax reform repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes while we are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the irs and the us treasury department we do not expect current local laws other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

as of january 31 2020 and 2019  cash and cash equivalents of 23 billion and 28 billion  respectively may not be freely transferable to the us due to local laws or other restrictions of the 23 billion as of january 31 2020  approximately 06 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the flipkart minority shareholders however this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of flipkart 

net cash used in investing activities 



net cash used in investing activities was 91 billion  240 billion and 91 billion for fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our ecommerce capabilities invest in other technologies remodel existing stores and club and add new stores and clubs net cash used in investing activities decreased 149 billion for fiscal 2020 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of the 138 billion payment for the acquisition of flipkart net of cash acquired as well as payments for other smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2019 net cash used in investing activities increased 150 billion for fiscal 2019 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the previously mentioned fiscal 2019 acquisitions additionally refer to the  strategic capital allocation  section in our company performance metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2020 and 2019  

growth activities 

for the fiscal year ending january 31 2021 fiscal 2021  we project capital expenditures will be approximately 11 billion with a focus on store remodels and customer initiatives ecommerce technology and supply chain we also expect to add approximately 250 new stores in walmart international primarily in mexico and china 

net cash used in financing activities 



net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our shortterm and longterm debt financing obligations dividends paid and the repurchase of company stock transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities fiscal 2020 net cash used in financing activities increased 118 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the 159 billion of net proceeds received in the prior year from the issuance of longterm debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for flipkart partially offset by 55 billion of additional longterm debt in the current year to fund general business operations fiscal 2019 net cash used in financing activities decreased 173 billion for fiscal 2019 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the 159 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for flipkart and for general corporate purposes as well as a decrease in share repurchases due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the flipkart announcement 

shortterm borrowings 

net cash flows used in shortterm borrowings increased in fiscal 2020 and were relatively flat in fiscal 2019  we generally utilize the liquidity provided by shortterm borrowings to provide funding for our operations dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and other cash requirements for fiscal 2020  the additional cash used in shortterm borrowings was primarily due to longterm debt issuances being used to pay down shortterm borrowings 

the following table includes additional information related to the companys shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  



in addition to our shortterm borrowings we have 150 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the us and approximately 29 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the us  as of january 31 2020  that provide additional liquidity if needed 

longterm debt 

the following table provides the changes in our longterm debt for fiscal 2020  

our total longterm debt increased 37 billion for fiscal 2020  primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of longterm debt in both april 2019 and september 2019 to fund general business operations partially offset by repayments of longterm debt 

dividends 

our total dividend payments were 60 billion  61 billion and 61 billion for fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively the board of directors approved effective february 18 2020  the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of 216 per share an increase over the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of 212 per share for fiscal 2021  the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of 054 per share according to the following record and payable dates 



company share repurchase program 

from time to time the company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the companys board of directors all repurchases made during fiscal 2020 were made under the current 20 billion share repurchase program approved in october 2017 which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the company can make share repurchases as of january 31 2020  authorization for 57 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status 

we regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things current cash needs capacity for leverage cost of borrowings our results of operations and the market price of our common stock we anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the companys free cash flow the following table provides on a settlement date basis the number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  

capital resources 

we believe cash flows from operations our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases 

we have strong commercial paper and longterm debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets as of january 31 2020  the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding longterm debt were as follows 



credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the general economic environment conditions in the retail industry our financial position including our total debt and capitalization and changes in our business strategy any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us in addition any downgrade of our current shortterm credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing the credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments such as debt and lease agreements and certain contingent commitments as of january 31 2020  



 under the terms of the sale of the majority stake of walmart brazil we agreed to indemnify advent for certain preclosing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to r23 billion  adjusted for interest based on the brazilian interbank deposit rate as of january 31 2020  the indemnification liability recorded was 07 billion and included in deferred income taxes and other in the companys consolidated balance sheet 

additionally we have 150 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the us and approximately 29 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the us which if drawn upon would be included in the current liabilities section of the companys consolidated balance sheets 

estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of january 31 2020  and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt 

purchase obligations include legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases as well as commitments to make capital expenditures software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts for the purposes of the above table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction contracts that specify the company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity are excluded from the table above accordingly purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time 

periods we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

the expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations

summary of critical accounting estimates 

management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing the companys consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates 

management continually reviews our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the lastin firstout lifo method for walmart us segments inventories the inventory at the sams club segment is valued using the weightedaverage cost lifo method when necessary we record a lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices as a measure of sensitivity a 1 increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory as of january 31 2020 and 2019  our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo 

impairment of assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable managements judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance the evaluation of longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining the value of longlived assets is impaired resulting in a writedown of the related longlived assets impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2020 were 

immaterial as a measure of sensitivity fiscal 2020 impairment would not change materially with a 10 decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment while fiscal 2019 included a pretax loss of 48 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil which included full impairment of all relatedassets there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019 

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available for intangible assets acquired in a business combination we typically use the income method significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 

goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics as of january 31 2020  our reporting units consisted of walmart us walmart international and sams club goodwill and other indefinitelived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative marketbased approach historically our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value our indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost however due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020 we recorded approximately 07 billion in impairment related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted 

contingencies 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in note 10 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

income taxes 

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions accordingly the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies increases and decreases in valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our us and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the us statutory rate and may fluctuate as a result 

our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net 

operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies this evaluation relies on estimates 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act was enacted and contains significant changes to us income tax law effective beginning january 2018 the tax act reduced the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 and created new taxes on foreignsourced earnings and relatedparty payments as discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act in fiscal 2019 as further guidance is issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standard–setting bodies any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and the fair value of our equity investment in jdcom 

the analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes the effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption in reality however a change in one factor could cause a change in another which may magnify or negate other sensitivities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps for fiscal 2020  the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased   175 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for longterm debt the table represents the principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates for interest rate swaps the table represents the contractual cash flows and weightedaverage interest rates by the contractual maturity date unless otherwise noted the notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts the weightedaverage variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of january 31 2020  



 as of january 31 2020  our variable rate borrowings including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps represented 12 of our total shortterm and longterm debt based on january 31 2020 debt levels a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately 61 million  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the us as well our foreigncurrencydenominated longterm debt for fiscal 2020  movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the companys subsidiaries in the uk and mexico were the primary cause of the 03 billion gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps the aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of 241 million and asset position of 62 million as of january 31 2020 and january 31 2019  respectively the change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates primarily the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2020  the hypothetical result of a uniform 10 weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of 173 million  a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of january 31 2020 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of 42 million  

in addition to currency swaps we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreigncurrencydenominated longterm debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations we had outstanding longterm debt of £17 billion as of january 31 2020 and january 31 2019 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the uk as of january 31 2020  a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of 201 million  in addition we had outstanding longterm debt of ¥180 billion as of january 31 2020 and january 31 2019 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in japan as of january 31 2020  a hypothetical 10 change in value of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of 150 million  

in certain countries we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

investment risk 

we are exposed to changes in the jdcom jd stock price as a result of our equity investment in jd the change in fair value is recorded within other gains and losses resulted in a gain of 19 billion in fiscal 2020 due to an increase in the stock price of jd as of january 31 2020  the fair value of our equity investment in jd was 54 billion  as of january 31 2020  a hypothetical 10 change in the stock price of jd would have changed our investment in jd by approximately 550 million

risk factors 

tableend

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally 

strategic risks 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may materially adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions and other economic factors globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates lower or higher prices of petroleum products including crude oil natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel higher costs for electricity and other energy weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws other regulatory changes the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the us or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the us or such other markets change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets goodwill or other longlived assets 

in addition the economic factors listed above any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation labor insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

the economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

each of our segments competes for customers employees digital prominence products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global ecommerce and omnichannel retailers wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries 

we compete in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omnichannel integration of our physical and digital operations 

a failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance see  item 1 business  above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments 

certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace other segments are substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions such consolidation or other business combinations or alliances or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers demand for the products and services we sell our market share and the growth of our business 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment price transparency assortment of products customer experience convenience ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the products we sell our market share and the growth of our business 

failure to successfully execute our omnichannel strategy and the cost of our increasing ecommerce investments may materially adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance 

the retail business is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping digitally as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate 

our strategy which includes acquisitions joint ventures investments in ecommerce technology store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our ecommerce business increase comparable store sales maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings the success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omnichannel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this item 1a  as a result our market position net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other longlived assets in addition a greater concentration of ecommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs which would in turn reduce the opportunities for crossstore or crossclub sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance 

furthermore the cost of certain ecommerce and technology investments including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the shortterm and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term 

the performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

we may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail operations these arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance in addition any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance or business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

operational risks 

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes tropical storms floods fires earthquakes tsunamis cyclones typhoons weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geopolitical events such as war civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a 

country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores 

we bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to or destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor safety anticorruption and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us 

political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet certain of our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control 

in addition the us foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

if the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations we could lose customers incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand reputation and financial performance we may also face reputational and other risks related to thirdparty sales on our digital platforms 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and may also expose us to product liability or food safety claims as such any issue regarding the safety of any food or nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our brand reputation and financial performance in addition thirdparties sell goods on some of our digital platforms which we refer to as marketplace transactions the applicability to us of laws related to such sales is currently unsettled and we may face reputational financial and other risks including liability for thirdparty sales of goods that are counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent 

we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations 

given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical information systems our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates or contractors our information systems are essential to our business operations including the processing of transactions management of our associates facilities logistics inventories physical stores and clubs and our online operations our information systems are not fully 

redundant and if our systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken if we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our ecommerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our omnichannel sales strategy in addition to home delivery we offer walmart pickup pickup today club pickup and online grocery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs omnichannel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the us whether through organic growth or ecommerce acquisitions and in a number of markets in which our walmart international segment operates 

we must anticipate and meet our customers changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment any failure on our part to provide attractive userfriendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our digital platforms which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope and the computer and operating systems on which they run including those applications and systems in our acquired ecommerce businesses are regularly subject to cyberattacks those attacks involve attempts to gain access to our ecommerce websites including marketplace platforms or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers or members payment information and related risks discussed below such attacks if successful may also create denials of service or otherwise disable degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers and members shopping experience if we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters we could suffer loss of sales reductions in traffic reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company customers members associates and vendors whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation result in litigation or other legal actions against us cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results 

as do most retailers we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms we also utilize thirdparty service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation for encryption and authentication technology content delivery to customers and members backoffice support and other functions such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers members associates or vendors in addition our ecommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single hackers or small groups of hackers each year cyberattackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems as cyber threats evolve change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyberattacks might defeat our or a thirdparty service providers security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers members associates and vendors 

associate error or malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our thirdparty service providers security measures and a breach of our or their information systems moreover hardware software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs 

any breach of our security measures or any breach error or malfeasance of those of our thirdparty service providers and loss of our confidential information or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers members associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

in addition such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers members associates vendors and shareholders could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our ecommerce operations and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our ecommerce operations as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations net sales results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards our private label credit cards and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as payment network security operating guidelines and the payment card industry data security standard we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any cyberattack or incursion in our or one of our thirdparty service providers information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our walmart us and sams club segments a large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with thirdparty payers and payment administrators such as private insurers governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers pbms 

our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks including reductions in the thirdparty reimbursement rates for drugs changes in our payer mix ie shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms changes in third party payer drug formularies ie the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment growth in and our participation in or exclusion from exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by pbms andor any insurance plan or program increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking thirdparty reimbursement changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition changes in drug mix ie the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics changes in the health insurance market generally changes in the scope of or the elimination of medicare part d or medicaid drug programs increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations further consolidation among third party payers pbms or purchasers of drugs overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of 

the patient protection and affordable care act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act and other changes in laws rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business 

if the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies 

one or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of crossstore or crossclub selling opportunities and in turn adversely affect our overall net sales other results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected 

in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

financial risks 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations 

our operations in countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period in recent years fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations 

as a result of such translations fluctuations in currency exchange rates from periodtoperiod that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse periodoverperiod changes in our financial performance or reflecting a periodoverperiod improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable store and club sales growth rates ecommerce growth rates gross margin or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies additionally failure of walmarts performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock 

legal tax regulatory compliance reputational and other risks 

our international operations subject us to legislative judicial accounting legal regulatory tax political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance 

in addition to our us operations we operate our retail business in africa argentina canada central america chile china india japan mexico and the united kingdom 

during fiscal 2019 our walmart international operations generated approximately 24  of our consolidated net sales walmart internationals operations in various countries also sources goods and services from other countries our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions on ecommerce offerings in international markets such as india restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures local product safety and environmental laws tax regulations local labor laws antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future 

our business and results of operations in the uk may be negatively affected by increases in food costs changes in trade policies changes in labor immigration tax or other laws and fluctuations in currency exchange rates resulting from the uks pending exit from the european union we expect continued uncertainty around the extent of the impact of this exit on our business until the uk and the european union put in alternative trade and other arrangements 

the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anticorruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation 

changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

in fiscal 2019 our walmart us and sams club operating segments generated approximately 76 of our consolidated net sales the federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us a significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our us stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise whether imported directly or indirectly and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our us operations and our business 

we are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

for example the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act significantly changed income tax laws that affect us corporations and there are aspects of the tax act that remain unclear as additional guidance from the us tax authority is pending as further guidance is issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance 

in addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made 

changes in andor failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate   could materially adversely affect our reputation market position or our business and financial performance 

we operate in complex regulated environments in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations 

our pharmacy operations in the united states are subject to numerous federal state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including the health insurance portability and accountability act the affordable care act laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration the fda and the drug enforcement administration the dea trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer antikickback laws false claims laws and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy optical care and nurse practitioner services 

for example in the united states the dea and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal and holding of controlled substances the dea the fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

we are also governed by foreign national and state laws and regulations of general applicability including laws and regulations related to working conditions health and safety equal employment opportunity employee benefit and other labor and employment matters laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the united states in addition certain financial services we offer or make available such as our money transfer agent services are subject to legal and regulatory requirements including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering fraud and other illicit activity the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer 

untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary damages andor penalties in addition failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation in particular we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws as well as a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws 

in addition asda stores ltd asda a whollyowned subsidiary of the company has been named as a defendant in numerous equal value claims pending in the manchester employment tribunal the employment tribunal in the united kingdom the claimants who are current and former asda store employees allege that the work performed by female employees in asdas retail stores is of equal value in terms of among other things the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in asdas warehouses and distribution facilities and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified the claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis at present we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters  

in december 2017 the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs including counties cities healthcare providers native american tribes individuals and thirdparty payors asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse the consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled in re national prescription opiate litigation   mdl no 2804  and is pending in the us district court for the northern district of ohio the company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation similar cases that name the company have also been filed in state courts by state local and tribal governments health care providers and other plaintiffs plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief including abatement the company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims 

we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption  item 3 legal proceedings  and in note 10  in the  notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are part of this annual report on form 10k 

we could be subject to liability penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our ongoing fcpa matter 

as previously disclosed we are under investigation by the us department of justice the doj and the sec regarding possible violations of the fcpa we have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have been ongoing with them regarding the resolution of these matters these discussions have progressed to a point that in fiscal 2018 we reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an aggregate accrual of 283 million with respect to these matters the accrual 

a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico also investigated these matters walmex cooperated with the mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations 

furthermore lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of our shareholders against us certain of our current and former directors and former officers and certain of walmexs former officers these matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements 

we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the ongoing government investigations and such actions if brought may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other relief criminal convictions andor penalties shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception among certain audiences of our role as a corporate citizen moreover we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations in defending the shareholder lawsuits and with respect to investigations 

while we have made an accrual for these matters because the discussions are continuing there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters including the accrual and the payment of the accrual at some pointintime in the future will have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in the future

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

this discussion which presents our results for the fiscal years ended january 31 2019  fiscal 2019  january 31 2018  fiscal 2018  and january 31 2017  fiscal 2017  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes we also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the companys performance additionally the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole 

management measures the results of the companys segments using each segments operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations as well as other measures from time to time we revise the measurement of each segments operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker in fiscal 2019 the company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations including depreciation expense to the operating segments and accordingly revised prior period amounts for comparability  

management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales or comparable sales a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmarts definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months including remodels relocations expansions and conversions as well as ecommerce sales we measure the ecommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or though mobile applications including omnichannel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the stores retail square feet of more than five percent   additionally sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months comparable sales are also referred to as samestore sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar into us dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates additionally no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for nonusd acquisitions until owned for 12 months   throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results including net sales and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future 

our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays as well as weather patterns generally our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending january 31  

we made certain strategic portfolio decisions further discussed in item 1 business  which include the following 



the retail industry 

we operate in the highly competitive omnichannel retail industry in all of the markets we serve we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets as well as ecommerce businesses many of these competitors are national regional or international chains or have a national or international omnichannel or ecommerce presence we also compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to catastrophic events weather competitive pressures consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability cost of goods currency exchange rate fluctuations customer preferences deflation inflation fuel and energy prices general economic conditions insurance costs interest rates labor costs tax rates the imposition of tariffs cybersecurity attacks and unemployment further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under  item 1a risk factors  and under  cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements  

company performance metrics 

we are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices supported by everyday low costs at times we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate we define our financial framework as 

 as we execute on this financial framework we believe our returns on capital will improve over time 

strong efficient growth 

our objective of prioritizing strong efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities increasing comparable store and club sales accelerating ecommerce sales growth and expansion of omnichannel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs at times we make strategic investments which are focused on the longterm growth of the company 

comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar also known as the 454 calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases however when we discuss our comparable sales below we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar 

calendar comparable sales as well as the impact of fuel for fiscal 2019  and 2018  were as follows 



walmart us comparable sales increased 37  and 21  in fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively driven by ticket and traffic growth walmart us ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 13 and 07 to comparable sales for fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2018  respectively as we continue to focus on a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers  sams club comparable sales increased 54  and 28  in fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively sams club fiscal 2019  comparable sales were driven by strong traffic which was aided by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs and fuel sales these increases were partially offset by reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations in fiscal 2019  sams club fiscal 2018  comp sales were driven by strong traffic and fuel sales sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 09 and 07 to comparable sales for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively 

consistent operating discipline 

we operate with discipline by managing expenses optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve we invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity manage inventory and reduce costs we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating selling general and administrative expenses 



for fiscal 2019  operating selling general and administrative operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48   basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph  the improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in ecommerce and technology as well as a 160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit  

for fiscal 2018 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year while our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately 06 billion in charges related to sams club closures and discontinued real estate projects 400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates 300 million related to home office severance the legal accrual of 283 million related to the fcpa matter a charge of 244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in walmart us and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party brazil ecommerce operations 

strategic capital allocation 

we are allocating more capital to ecommerce technology supply chain and store remodels and less to new store and club openings when compared to prior years this allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers  total fiscal 2019 capital expenditures increased slightly compared to the prior year the following table provides additional detail 



returns 

as we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on assets return on investment and free cash flow metrics we also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources  section 

return on assets and return on investment 

we include return on assets roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap and return on investment roi as metrics to assess returns on assets while roi is considered a nongaap financial measure management believes roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances longterm strategic initiatives with possible shortterm impacts roa was 34  and 52  for the fiscal years ended january 31 2019  and 2018  respectively for fiscal 2019  the decline in roa was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income resulting from the 45 billion net loss related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil and also the 28 billion net unrealized loss on our jdcom investment for fiscal 2018  the decline in roa was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income roi was 142  for fiscal 2019  which was flat compared to fiscal 2018  

we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 

our calculation of roi is considered a nongaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of 8 for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases as mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa 

although roi is a standard financial measure numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi   beginning in fiscal 2020 our calculation of roi will change upon adoption of asu 201602 leases  primarily to replace the factor of 8 for rent expense with us gaap operating lease assets 

the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



 1 the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure    management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital resources  for discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of 278 billion  283 billion  and 317 billion  for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively we generated free cash flow of 174 billion  183 billion  and 211 billion  for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019  declined when compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to timing of vendor payments partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from us tax reform enacted on december 22 2017 tax reform and the timing of tax payments free cash flow for fiscal 2019  declined when compared to fiscal 2018   due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities as well as 03 billion in increased capital expenditures  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2018  from fiscal 2017  were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments as well as lapping the previous years improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017 

walmarts definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows  

although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a nongaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 



1 net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow 

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 



our total revenues which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income increased 141 billion  or 28  and 145 billion  or 30  for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year net sales increased 146 billion  or 29  and 144 billion  or 30  for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2019  net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for walmart us and sams club segments along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets and net sales 

from flipkart which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 additionally for fiscal 2019  the increase in net sales was partially offset by a 45 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the sams club segment during fiscal 2018  a  31  billion reduction in net sales due to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil  in the international segment and 07 billion  of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  for fiscal 2018  net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales the impact from new store openings and sales generated from ecommerce acquisitions the positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018  was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of 19 billion due to divesting our yihaodian and suburbia businesses  and the 05 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

our gross profit rate decreased 18  and 26 basis points for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2019  the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing ecommerce business the consolidation of flipkart our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses for fiscal 2018  the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing ecommerce business 

membership and other income decreased for fiscal 2019  when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the prior year recognition of a 387 million gain from the sale of suburbia in our international segment membership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year while fiscal 2018  included a 387 million gain from the sale of suburbia along with a 47 million gain from a land sale higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased plus member penetration at sams club these gains were offset by gains recognized in fiscal 2017  

for fiscal 2019  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48  basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph  the improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in ecommerce and technology as well as a 160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit  

for fiscal 2018 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year while our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately 06 billion in charges related to sams club closures and discontinued real estate projects 400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates 300 million related to home office severance the legal accrual of 283 million related to the fcpa matter a charge of 244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in walmart us and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party brazil ecommerce operations 

other losses were 84 billion  for fiscal 2019  primarily the result of the 48 billion pretax loss on the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil and a 35 billion pretax decrease in the market value of our investment in jdcom fiscal 2018  results included loss on extinguishment of debt of 31 billion  

our effective income tax rate was 374  for fiscal 2019  304  for fiscal 2018  and 303 for fiscal 2017  although the us statutory rate was lowered due to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019  primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil and flipkarts results additionally our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our us operations and international operations which are subject to statutory rates that beginning in fiscal 2019 are generally higher than the us statutory rate the reconciliation from the us statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  is presented in note 9  in the  notes to consolidated financial statements  

as a result of the factors discussed above we reported 72 billion  and 105 billion  of consolidated net income for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively which represents a decrease of 33 billion  and 38 billion  for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year diluted net income per common share attributable to walmart eps was 226  328  and 438  for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively 

walmart us segment 



net sales for the walmart us segment increased 132 billion  or 41  and 106 billion or 35  for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 37  and 21  for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively driven by ticket and traffic growth walmart us ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 13 and 07 to comparable sales for fiscal 2019  and 2018  additionally for fiscal 2018  yearoveryear growth in retail square feet further contributed to the yearoveryear increase 

gross profit rate decreased 28  and 24 basis points for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2019  the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy increased transportation expenses and the mix effects from our growing ecommerce business for fiscal 2018  the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing ecommerce business partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018  was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 23  basis points for fiscal 2019  and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in fiscal 2019  was primarily due to strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and the prior year comparable period including charges related to discontinued real estate projects of 244 million these improvements more than offset investments in ecommerce technology and omnichannel initiatives and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal 2019 

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 391 million  for fiscal 2019  and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018  respectively when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year 

walmart international segment 



net sales for the walmart international segment increased 28 billion  or 23  and 19 billion or 17  for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2019  the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from flipkart which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 these increases were partially offset by a  31  billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil  a 07 billion  negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the continued wind down of our first party brazil ecommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of 140 million due to divesting our suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 for fiscal 2018  the increase in net sales was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of new stores partially offset by a reduction in net sales of 19 billion due to divesting our yihaodian and suburbia businesses  and a 05 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

gross profit rate decreased 41  and 28 basis points for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2019  the decrease was due to flipkart and strategic price investments in certain markets for fiscal 2018  the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to strategic price investments in certain markets 

membership and other income decreased 224 and 140 for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in fiscal 2019  was due to the prior year recognition of a 387 million gain from the sale of suburbia while fiscal 2018  included the 387 million gain from the sale of suburbia and a 47 million gain from a land sale these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal   2017  which included a 535 million gain from the sale of our yihaodian business and a 194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in chile  

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 37  basis points for fiscal 2019  and was flat for 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2019  was primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately 05 billion which included charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party brazil ecommerce operations this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from flipkart in fiscal 2019  while fiscal 2018  was benefited by an increase in net sales this benefit was offset by restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately 05 billion including charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down  the first party brazil ecommerce operations  

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income decreased 346 million  and 508 million for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively 

sams club segment 



  

1 we believe the excluding fuel information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the sams club segments fuel sales on its results of operations which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the sams club segment in the future 

net sales for the sams club segment decreased 14 billion  or 23  for fiscal 2019  and increased 19 billion or 32  for fiscal 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2019  the decrease was primarily due to a 45 billion decrease in net sales resulting from the net closure of 63 clubs during fiscal 2018  as well as reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations these decreases were partially offset by increases in comparable sales which were benefited by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 09 to comparable sales for fiscal 2019  additional fuel sales of 07 billion  partially offset the decreases in net sales for fiscal 2019  for fiscal 2018  the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of 07 billion in fuel sales from higher fuel prices sams club ecommerce sales positively contributed approximately 07 to comparable sales for fiscal 2018  

gross profit rate was relatively flat for fiscal 2019  and decreased 44 basis points for fiscal 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2019  gross profit rate was benefited by lapping the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures in fiscal 2018  and decreased tobacco sales in fiscal 2019  which have lower margins this benefit to the gross profit rate was offset by higher transportation costs and ecommerce shipping costs investments in price and increased shrink in fiscal 2019 for fiscal 2018  the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures a reclassification of certain supply expenses from operating expenses to cost of goods sold increased shrink increased ecommerce shipping costs and the investment in cash rewards 

membership and other income increased 26  and 23 for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2019  the increase was due to an increase of 15 in membership income resulting from increased plus member penetration and gains on property sales these increases were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2018  the increase in membership and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 13 in membership income resulting from increased plus member penetration 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 99  basis points for fiscal 2019  and increased 83 basis points for fiscal 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2019  the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately 06 billion in the prior years comparable period related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects this charge resulted in the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales in fiscal 2018  

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 605 million  for fiscal 2019  and decreased 713 million f or fiscal   2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

the strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity our cash flows provided by operating activities supplemented with our longterm debt and shortterm borrowings have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the longterm growth of our operations generally some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations finance our global investment and expansion activities pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

net cash provided by operating activities 



net cash provided by operating activities was 278 billion  283 billion  and 317 billion  for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019  declined when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to timing of vendor payments partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from tax reform and the timing of tax payments  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year was due to the timing of tax and other payments as well as lapping the previous years improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017 

cash equivalents and working capital 

cash and cash equivalents were 77 billion  and 68 billion  as of january 31 2019  and 2018  respectively our working capital deficit was 156 billion  and 189 billion  as of january 31 2019  and 2018  respectively we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases the decreased working capital deficit as of january 31 2019  compared to 2018  was primarily due to higher current assets as a result of the consolidation of flipkart 

historically we have used intercompany financing arrangements to make cash available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible during fiscal 2019 we repatriated to the us 53 billion  of cash at a tax cost of approximately 40 million  

as of january 31 2019  and 2018  cash and cash equivalents of 28 billion  and 14 billion  respectively may not be freely transferable to the us due to local laws or other restrictions of the 28 billion  as of january 31 2019  approximately 12 billion  can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the flipkart minority shareholders however this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of flipkart 

net cash used in investing activities 



net cash used in investing activities was 240 billion  91 billion  and 139 billion  for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our ecommerce capabilities invest in other technologies remodel existing stores and club and add new stores and clubs net cash used in investing activities increased 150 billion  for fiscal 2019  when compared to the previous fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the 138 billion  payment for flipkart  net of cash acquired as well as payments for other smaller acquisitions net cash used in investing activities decreased 48 billion  for fiscal 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year fiscal 2018  included cash received of 10 billion from the sale of suburbia in mexico while fiscal 2017  included our acquisition of jetcom inc jetcom for 24 billion and our purchase of 19 billion of shares in jdcom jd refer to note 13  to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our acquisition of jetcom and investment in jd additionally refer to the  strategic capital allocation  section in our company performance metrics  for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2019  and 2018  

growth activities 

for the fiscal year ending january 31 2020  fiscal 2020  we project capital expenditures will be approximately 110 billion in fiscal 2020  we expect to add approximately 300 new stores in walmart international primarily in mexico central america and china and add less than 10 stores in walmart us 

net cash used in financing activities 



net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our shortterm and longterm debt financing obligations dividends paid and the repurchase of company stock transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities fiscal 2019  net cash used in financing activities decreased 173 billion  when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the 159 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for flipkart and for general corporate purposes as well as a decrease in share repurchases due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the flipkart announcement fiscal 2018  net cash used in financing activities increased 08 billion  for fiscal 2018  when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the increase was primarily due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of debt further discussion of financing activities is provided by major categories below 

shortterm borrowings 

net cash flows provided by shortterm borrowings were relatively flat in fiscal 2019 and increased 41 billion  in fiscal 2018  when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year we generally utilize the liquidity provided by shortterm borrowings to provide funding for our operations dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and other cash requirements for fiscal 2018  the additional cash provided by shortterm borrowings was primarily due to the timing of our january 2018 debt extinguishment 

the following table includes additional information related to the companys shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  



in addition to our shortterm borrowings we have 150 billion  of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the us and approximately 28 billion  of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the us  as of january 31 2019  that provide additional liquidity if needed 

longterm debt 

the following table provides the changes in our longterm debt for fiscal 2019  

our total longterm debt increased 116 billion  for fiscal 2019  primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of longterm debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for flipkart and for general corporate purposes  

dividends 

our total dividend payments were 61 billion  61 billion  and 62 billion  for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the board of directors approved effective february 19 2019  the fiscal 2020  annual dividend of 212  per share an increase over the fiscal 2019  annual dividend of 208  per share for fiscal 2020  the annual dividend will be paid in four  quarterly installments of 053  per share according to the following record and payable dates 



company share repurchase program 

from time to time the company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the companys board of directors all repurchases made during  fiscal 2019   were made under the current   20 billion   share repurchase program approved in october 2017 which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the company can make share repurchases   as of january 31 2019  authorization for 113 billion   of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status   

we regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things current cash needs capacity for leverage cost of borrowings our results of operations and the market price of our common stock   we anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the companys free cash flow the following table provides on a settlement date basis the number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for  fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  

share repurchases decreased for fiscal 2019  and were relatively flat for fiscal 2018  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in fiscal 2019  was due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the announcement of the flipkart acquisition repurchases of company stock returned to a more normalized level in the latter half of fiscal 2019 

capital resources 

we believe cash flows from operations our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases 

we have strong commercial paper and longterm debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets as of january 31 2019  the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding longterm debt were as follows 



credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the general economic environment conditions in the retail industry our financial position including our total debt and capitalization and changes in our business strategy any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us in addition any downgrade of our current shortterm credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing the credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments such as debt and lease agreements and certain contingent commitments as of january 31 2019  



 under the terms of the sale of the majority stake of walmart brazil we agreed to indemnify advent for certain preclosing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to r23 billion  adjusted for interest based on the brazilian interbank deposit rate as of january 31 2019  the indemnification liability recorded was 08 billion  and included in deferred income taxes and other in the companys consolidated balance sheet 

additionally we have 150 billion  of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the us and approximately 28 billion  of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the us  which if drawn upon would be included in the current liabilities section of the companys consolidated balance sheets 

estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of january 31 2019  and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt 

purchase obligations include legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases as well as commitments to make capital expenditures software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts for the purposes of the above table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction contracts that specify the company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity are excluded from the table above accordingly purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

the expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above 13 billion  of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities the timing of the payment if any associated with these liabilities is uncertain refer to note 9  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits 

off balance sheet arrangements 

as of january 31 2019  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

other matters 

we discuss our existing fcpa investigation and related matters and possible effects of those matters on walmarts business including certain risks arising therefrom in part i item 1a  of this form 10k under the caption risk factors and under the subcaption legal proceedings in note 10  to our consolidated financial statements which is captioned contingencies and appears elsewhere herein we discuss the asda equal value claims which includes certain existing employment claims against our united kingdom subsidiary asda stores ltd including certain risks arising therefrom in part i item 1a  of this form 10k under the caption risk factors and under the subcaption legal proceedings in note 10  to our consolidated financial statements which is captioned contingencies and appears elsewhere herein we also discuss the national prescription opiate litigation and related matters including certain risks arising therefrom in part i item 1a  of this form 10k under the caption risk factors and under the subcaption legal proceedings in note 10  to our consolidated financial statements which is captioned contingencies and appears elsewhere herein we also discuss various legal proceedings related to the fcpa investigation asda equal value claims and national prescription opiate litigation in part i item 3  herein under the caption legal proceedings the foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k represent contingent liabilities of the company that may or may not result in the company incurring a material liability upon their final resolution 

summary of critical accounting estimates 

management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing the companys consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates 

management continually reviews our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the lastin firstout lifo method for walmart us segments inventories the inventory at the sams club segment is valued using the weightedaverage cost lifo method when necessary we record a lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices as a measure of sensitivity a 1 increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory as of january 31 2019  and 2018  our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo 

impairment of assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable managements judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance the evaluation of longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining the value of longlived assets is impaired resulting in a writedown of the related longlived assets while fiscal 2019 included a pretax loss of 48 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil which included full impairment of all relatedassets there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019 as a measure of sensitivity fiscal 2019 impairment would not change materially with a 10 decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment for fiscal 2018 although impairment charges were 14 billion these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in   note 14  as well as discontinued real estate projects in the us and decisions to exit certain international properties  impairment charges not related to restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not material 

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available for intangible assets acquired in a business combination we typically use the income method significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flows growth rates discount rates and useful lives the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 

goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics   as of january 31 2019  our reporting units consisted of walmart us walmart international and sams club goodwill and other indefinitelived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative marketbased approach historically our reporting units and other indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinitelived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted for approximately 300 million of certain acquired indefinitelived intangible assets the fair value approximated the carrying value any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions accordingly the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies increases and decreases in valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our us and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the us statutory rate and may fluctuate as a result 

our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies this evaluation relies heavily on estimates 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act was enacted and contains significant changes to us income tax law effective beginning january 2018 the tax act reduced the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 and created new taxes on foreignsourced earnings and relatedparty payments as discussed in note 9  to our consolidated financial statements we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act in fiscal 2019 as further guidance is issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standard–setting bodies any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and the fair value of our equity investment in jdcom 

the analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes the effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption in reality however a change in one factor could cause a change in another which may magnify or negate other sensitivities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps for fiscal 2019  the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased   13 million  primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for longterm debt the table represents the principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates for interest rate swaps the table represents the contractual cash flows and weightedaverage interest rates by the contractual maturity date unless otherwise noted the notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts the weightedaverage variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of january 31 2019  



 as of january 31 2019  our variable rate borrowings including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps represented 22  of our total shortterm and longterm debt based on january 31 2019  debt levels a 100  basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately 110 million  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the us as well our foreigncurrencydenominated longterm debt for fiscal 2019  movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the companys subsidiaries in the uk chile and canada were the primary cause of the 21 billion  loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps the aggregate fair value of these swaps was in an asset position of 62 million  and 413 million  as of january 31 2019  and january 31 2018  respectively the change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates primarily the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2019  a hypothetical 10 change in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate as of january 31 2019  would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of 515 million  a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of january 31 2019  would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of 13 million  

in addition to currency swaps we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreigncurrencydenominated longterm debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations we had outstanding longterm debt of £17 billion  as of january 31 2019  and january 31 2018  that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the united kingdom as of january 31 2019  a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of 201 million  in addition we had outstanding longterm debt of ¥180 billion  as of january 31 2019  and january 31 2018  that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in japan as of january 31 2019  a hypothetical 10 change in value of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of 150 million  

in certain countries we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

investment risk 

we are exposed to changes in the jdcom jd stock price as a result of our equity investment in jd since february 1 2018 when we adopted the new financial instrument accounting standard the change in fair value recorded within other gains and losses resulted in a loss of 35 billion  due to a decrease in the stock price of jd as of january 31 2019  the fair value of our equity investment in jd was 36 billion

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally 

strategic risks 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may materially adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions and other economic factors globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates lower or higher prices of petroleum products including crude oil natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel higher costs for electricity and other energy weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws other regulatory changes the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade overall economic slowdown and other economic factors in the us or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the us or such other markets change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

in addition the economic factors listed above any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation labor insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

the economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators whether through physical retail digital retail or the integration of both which could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

each of our segments competes for customers employees store and club sites digital prominence products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global physical and digital retailers wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries 

our walmart us segment competes with both physical retailers operating discount department retail and wholesale grocers drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets hypermarkets and supercentertype stores and digital retailers as well as catalog businesses   our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as digital retailers and catalog businesses 

our walmart international segment competes with both physical retailers who operate department drug discount variety and specialty stores supermarkets hypermarkets and supercentertype stores wholesale clubs homeimprovement stores specialty electronics stores cash  carry operations and convenience stores and digital retailers as well as catalog businesses   

we compete in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through the omnichannel integration of  our physical and digital retail  operations 

a failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance see  item 1 business  above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments 

certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation or other business combinations or alliances may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers demand for the products and services we sell our market share and the growth of our business 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs through our digital platforms or through the combination of both price transparency assortment of products customer experience convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the products we sell our market share and the growth of our business 

failure to grow our ecommerce business through the omnichannel integration of   physical and digital retail  or otherwise and the cost of our increasing ecommerce investments may materially adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance 

the retail business is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate 

our strategy which includes investments in ecommerce technology store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our ecommerce business increase comparable store sales maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings the success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omnichannel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this item 1a  as a result our market position net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected in addition a greater concentration of ecommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs which would in turn reduce the opportunities for crossstore or crossclub sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations 

furthermore the cost of certain ecommerce and technology investments including any operating losses incurred by acquired ecommerce businesses will adversely impact our financial performance in the shortterm and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term 

the performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of our walmart international segment could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our walmart international segment may enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our digital retail operations physical retail operations or both any strategic alliance may not generate the level of ecommerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our 

business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance in addition any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

operational risks 

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes tropical storms floods fires earthquakes tsunamis cyclones typhoons weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geopolitical events such as war civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores 

we bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to or destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor safety and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us 

political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet certain of our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the us currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control 

in addition the uss foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

if the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations we could lose customers incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our brand reputation and financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food or nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our brand reputation and financial performance 

we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations 

given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical information systems our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates or contractors our information systems are essential to our business operations including the processing of transactions management of our associates facilities logistics inventories physical stores and clubs and our online operations our information systems are not fully redundant and if our systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken if we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our ecommerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us using our digital platforms which are a part of our omnichannel sales strategy increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop online and through digital platforms with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our omnichannel sales strategy in addition to home delivery we offer walmart pickup pickup today and club pickup and in a growing number of locations online grocery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs omnichannel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the us whether through organic growth or ecommerce acquisitions and in a number of markets in which our walmart international segment operates 

we must anticipate and meet our customers changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment any failure on our part to provide attractive userfriendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our digital platforms which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope and the computer and operating systems on which they run including those applications and systems in our acquired ecommerce businesses may be subject to cyberattacks those attacks could involve attempts to gain access to one of our ecommerce websites or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers or members payment information and related risks discussed below such attacks if successful can also create denials of service or otherwise disable degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers and members shopping experience if we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters we could suffer loss of sales reductions in traffic reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company customers members associates and vendors whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation result in litigation or other legal actions against us cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results 

as do most retailers we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms we also utilize thirdparty service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation for encryption and authentication technology content delivery to customers and members backoffice support and other functions such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers members associates or vendors in addition our ecommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single hackers or small groups of hackers each year cyberattackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems as cyber threats evolve change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyberattacks might defeat our or a thirdparty service providers security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers members associates and vendors 

associate error or malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our thirdparty service providers security measures and a breach of our or their information systems moreover hardware software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs 

any breach of our security measures or any breach error or malfeasance of those of our thirdparty service providers and loss of our confidential information or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers members associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

in addition such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers members associates vendors and shareholders could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our ecommerce operations and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our ecommerce operations as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations net sales results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital retail operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards our private label credit cards and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as payment network security operating guidelines and the payment card industry data security standard we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any cyberattack or incursion in our or one of our thirdparty service providers information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our walmart us and sams club segments and a large majority of the retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with thirdparty payers and payment administrators such as private insurers governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers pbms 

our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks including reductions in the thirdparty reimbursement rates for drugs changes in our payer mix ie shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms changes in third party payer drug formularies ie the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment growth in and our participation in or exclusion from exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by pbms andor any insurance plan or program increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking thirdparty reimbursement changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition changes in drug mix ie the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics changes 

in the health insurance market generally changes in the scope of or the elimination of medicare part d or medicaid drug programs increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations further consolidation among third party payers pbms or purchasers of drugs overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act and other changes in laws rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business 

if the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies 

one or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations and the net sales and gross margin of those operations result in the loss of crossstore or crossclub selling opportunities and in turn adversely affect our overall net sales other results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected 

in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

financial risks 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations 

our operations in countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period in recent years fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 

as a result of such translations fluctuations in currency exchange rates from periodtoperiod that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse periodoverperiod changes in our financial performance or reflecting a periodoverperiod improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable store and club sales growth rates ecommerce growth 

rates gross margin or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies additionally failure of walmarts performance to match that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock 

legal tax regulatory compliance reputational and other risks 

our operations subject us to legislative judicial accounting legal regulatory tax political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance 

in addition to our us operations we operate our retail business principally through whollyowned subsidiaries in argentina brazil canada chile china india japan and the united kingdom and our majorityowned subsidiaries in africa central america and mexico 

in fiscal 2018 our walmart us and sams club operating segments generated approximately 76  of our consolidated net sales the federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us a significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our us stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise whether imported directly or indirectly and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our us operations and our business 

during fiscal 2018 our walmart international operations generated approximately 24  of our consolidated net sales walmart internationals operations in various countries also sources goods and services from other countries our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints local product safety and environmental laws tax regulations local labor laws antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future 

our business and results of operations in the uk may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates increases in food costs changes in trade policies or changes in labor immigration tax or other laws resulting from the uks anticipated exit from the european union 

brazilian federal state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations although the company believes it complies with those laws the companys subsidiaries in brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and nonincome tax assessments which have arisen during the normal course of business in brazil these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the company could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anticorruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation 

we are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being 

lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act was enacted and contains significant changes to us income tax law effective in 2018 the tax act reduces the us statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates new taxes focused on foreignsourced earnings and relatedparty payments in addition the company was subject to a onetime transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 on december 22 2017 which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the tax act the company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of january 31 2018 in accordance with sab 118 as the company collects and prepares necessary data and interprets the tax act and any additional guidance issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies the company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts during fiscal 2019 those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made and could impact our net income and our earnings per share as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity 

we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made 

we operate in complex regulated environments in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations our pharmacy operations in the united states are subject to numerous federal state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including the health insurance portability and accountability act the affordable care act or any successor thereto laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration the fda and the drug enforcement administration the dea trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer antikickback laws false claims laws and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy optical care and nurse practitioner services 

for example in the united states the dea and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations we are also governed by foreign national and state laws of general applicability including laws regulating matters of working conditions health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit competition antimoney laundering antitrust matters and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the united states changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business 

the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary damages andor penalties any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial 

exposure damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

connection with the government investigations in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations 

while we have made an accrual for these matters because the discussions are continuing there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future

our operations consist of three reportable segments walmart us walmart international and sams club 

 each of our segments contributes to the companys operating results differently each however has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the companys net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the walmart international segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

our fiscal year ends on january 31  for our us and canadian operations we consolidate all other operations generally using a onemonth lag and on a calendar year basis our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays as well as weather patterns generally our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending january 31  

this discussion which presents our results for the fiscal years ended january 31 2018  fiscal 2018  january 31 2017  fiscal 2017  and january 31 2016  fiscal 2016  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes we also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the companys performance additionally the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole 

throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club sales and other measures management measures the results of the companys segments using each segments operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations as well as other measures from time to time we revise the measurement of each segments operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation 

comparable store and club sales or comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmarts definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months including remodels relocations expansions and conversions as well as ecommerce sales we measure the ecommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or though mobile applications including omnichannel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs sales of a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the stores retail square feet of more than five percent additionally sales related to ecommerce acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months comparable sales are also referred to as samestore sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

in discussing our operating results we use the term currency exchange rates to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar into us dollars for financial reporting purposes we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results including net sales and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future 

the retail industry 

we operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets as well as ecommerce businesses many of these competitors are national regional or international chains or have a national or international online presence we compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to catastrophic events weather competitive pressures consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability cost of goods currency exchange rate fluctuations customer preferences deflation inflation fuel and energy prices general economic conditions insurance costs interest rates labor costs tax rates cybersecurity attacks and unemployment further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under  item 1a risk factors  and under  cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements  

company performance metrics 

we are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices supported by everyday low costs at times we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate our financial framework is defined as 

 as we execute on this financial framework we believe our returns on capital will improve over time 

strong efficient growth 

our objective of prioritizing strong efficient growth means we will focus on increasing comparable sales and ecommerce sales growth while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs at times we make strategic investments which are focused on the longterm growth of the company which may not benefit comparable sales in the near term 

comparable sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar also known as the 454 calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases however when we discuss our comparable sales below we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases 

calendar comparable sales as well as the impact of fuel for fiscal 2018  and 2017  were as follows 



comparable sales in the us including fuel   increased 22  and 14  in fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the fiscal 2018  total us comparable sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement higher ecommerce sales and the impact of higher fuel sales ecommerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 07  for both walmart us and sams club for fiscal 2018  the fiscal 2017 total us comparable sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher ecommerce sales at the walmart us segment partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the sams club segment ecommerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 04 and 07 for walmart us and sams club respectively for fiscal 2017  

in the past when we were focused on adding new stores and clubs in the us we did so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units we reduced the number of new store and club openings in fiscal 2018 and the negative impact on comparable sales as a result of these openings was not significant we expect this trend to continue in the future as well in fiscal 2017  we estimate the negative impact on comparable sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately 07 our estimate was calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs which are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs to those of nearby nonimpacted stores and clubs in each case as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened 

operating discipline 

we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating expenses 



for fiscal 2018  operating selling general and administrative operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32   basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year while our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately 06 billion of charges related to sams club closures and discontinued real estate projects approximately 400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates 300 million related to home office severance a legal accrual of 283 million related to the fcpa matter a charge of 244 million related to walmart us discontinued real estate projects and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party brazil ecommerce operations 

strategic capital allocation 

we are allocating more capital to remodels ecommerce technology and supply chain and less to new store and club openings when compared to prior years this allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and integrating digital and physical shopping the following table provides additional detail 



total us capital expenditures decreased 478 million  for fiscal 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year capital expenditures related to new stores and clubs including expansions and relocations decreased 13 billion  partially offset by increases to capital expenditures for remodels and for ecommerce technology supply chain and other these changes were a result of our shift in capital allocation strategy to support growth in comparable store and club sales and ecommerce while slowing the rate at which we open new stores and clubs 

returns 

as we execute our financial framework we believe our returns on capital will improve over time we measure returns on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics in addition we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources  section 

return on assets and return on investment 

we include return on assets roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap and return on investment roi as metrics to assess returns on assets while roi is considered a nongaap financial measure management believes roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances longterm potential strategic initiatives with possible shortterm impacts roa was 52  and 72  for the fiscal years ended january 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the decline in roa was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended january 31 2018  roi was 142  and 152  for the fiscal years ended january 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended january 31 2018  

we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations 

our calculation of roi is considered a nongaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases as mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa 

although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi 

the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



 1 the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure    management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital resources  for discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of 283 billion  317 billion  and 276 billion  for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we generated free cash flow of 183 billion  211 billion  and 161 billion  for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decreases in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2018  from fiscal 2017  were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments as well as lapping the previous years improvements in working capital management  and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2017  from fiscal 2016  was primarily due to improved working capital management additionally we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses 

walmarts definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows  

although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by walmarts management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a nongaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities 



1 net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow 

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 



our total revenues which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income increased 145 billion  or 30  and 37 billion or 08  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year net sales   increased 144 billion  or 30   and 2 7 billion or 06  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2018  net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales the impact from new store openings and sales generated from ecommerce acquisitions  additionally for fiscal 2018  the increase in net sales was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of 19 billion due to divesting our yihaodian and suburbia businesses  and the 05 billion  of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates for fiscal 2017  net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales and the 13 yearoveryear growth in consolidated retail square feet the positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017  was partially offset by a negative impact of 110 billion or 23 as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a 04 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the sams club segment 

our gross profit rate decreased 26  basis points for fiscal 2018  and increased 36 basis points for fiscal 2017  when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2018  the decrease was primarily due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from ecommerce for fiscal 2017  the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs in the walmart us segment additionally improvement in certain markets inventory management and cost analytics programs in the walmart international segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate for fiscal 2017  

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32  and 88 basis points for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2018  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to approximately 06 billion in charges related to sams club closures and discontinued real estate projects approximately 400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates 300 million related to home office severance a legal accrual of 283 million related to the fcpa matter in the third quarter a charge of 244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in walmart us and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party brazil ecommerce operations for fiscal 2017  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the walmart us and sams club segments resulting from the continued investment in associate wage structure a 370 million charge related to discontinued domestic real estate projects and severance and our 

continued investments in ecommerce and technology the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2017  was partially offset by the impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 

membership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018  and increased 10 billion for fiscal 2017  when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year while fiscal 2018  included a 387 million gain from the sale of suburbia a 47 million gain from a land sale higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased plus member penetration at sams club these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal   2017  fiscal 2017  included a 535 million gain from the sale of our yihaodian business and a 194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in chile 

for fiscal 2018 loss on extinguishment of debt was 31 billion  due to the early extinguishment of longterm debt which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods  

our effective income tax rate was 304  for fiscal 2018  and 303  for both fiscal 2017  and 2016  although relatively consistent yearoveryear our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from period to period as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies valuation allowances changes in tax laws outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our us operations and international operations the reconciliation from the us statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  is presented in note 9  in the  notes to consolidated financial statements  and describes the impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act to the fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate 

as a result of the factors discussed above we reported 105 billion  and 143 billion  of consolidated net income for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively which represents a decrease of 38 billion  and 08 billion  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year diluted net income per common share attributable to walmart eps was 328  and 438  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively

net sales for the walmart us segment increased 106 billion  or 35  and 95 billion or 32  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 21  and 16  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively and yearoveryear growth in retail square feet of 07  and 14 for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively additionally for fiscal 2018  sales generated from ecommerce acquisitions  further contributed to the yearoveryear increase 

gross profit rate decreased 24  basis points for fiscal 2018  and increased 24 basis points for fiscal 2017  when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2018  the decrease was primarily due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from ecommerce partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018  was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise for fiscal 2017  the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs

as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income increased 124 million  for fiscal 2018  and decreased 13 billion for fiscal 2017  respectively 

walmart international segment

segment operating income was negatively impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates of 68 million  and 642 million for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income decreased 406 million  for fiscal 2018  and increased 412 million for fiscal 2017  respectively 

sams club segment 

we believe the information in the below table under the caption excluding fuel is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the sams club segments fuel sales on its results of operations which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the sams club segment in the future 



  

net sales for the sams club segment increased 19 billion  or 32  and 05 billion or 09  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2018  the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of 07 billion  in fuel sales from higher fuel prices in fiscal 2018  for fiscal 2017  the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales without fuel driven by higher ecommerce sales and a yearoveryear increase in retail square feet of 09 partially offset by a decrease of 04 billion in fuel sales primarily from lower fuel prices in fiscal 2017  in the future net sales will be negatively impacted by our decision to remove tobacco in certain clubs 

gross profit rate decreased 44  basis points for fiscal 2018  and increased 39 basis points for fiscal 2017  when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2018  the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to the club closures a reclassification of certain supply expenses from operating expenses to cost of goods sold higher inventory shrink increased shipping costs at samsclubcom and the investment in cash rewards for fiscal 2017  the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to margin rate improvement in home and apparel health and wellness and grocery partially offset by changes in merchandise mix and the growth of the cash rewards program 

membership and other income increased 23  for fiscal 2018  and decreased 65 for fiscal 2017  when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2018  the increase in membership and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 13 in membership income resulting from increased plus member penetration for fiscal 2017  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in other income partially offset by an increase of 23 in membership income as a result of increased plus member renewals 

operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 80  and 49 basis points for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal 2018  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately 06 billion related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects for fiscal 2017  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage benefit and incentive expenses from the investment in the associate wage structure as well as our investments in ecommerce and technology and an increase in advertising expense

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

the strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity our cash flows provided by operating activities supplemented with our longterm debt and shortterm borrowings have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the longterm growth of our operations generally some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations finance our global investment and expansion activities pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

net cash provided by operating activities 



net cash provided by operating activities was 283 billion  317 billion  and 276 billion  for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018  when compared to the previous fiscal year was due to the timing of tax and other payments as well as lapping the previous years improvements in working capital management  and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017  when compared to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to improved working capital management additionally we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses    

cash equivalents and working capital 

cash and cash equivalents were 68 billion  and 69 billion  at january 31 2018  and 2017  respectively our working capital deficit was 189 billion  and 92 billion  at january 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the increase in our working capital deficit reflects an increase in shortterm borrowings as part of our longterm debt extinguishment activity as well as improved procurement and inventory management we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases 

we use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the us and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities supplemented with longterm debt and shortterm borrowings accordingly we intend with only certain exceptions to continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the us in our foreign operations as part of us tax reform enacted on december 22 2017 we are currently assessing the impact of the new legislation which can in turn impact our assertion regarding any potential future repatriation if our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the amounts held within our foreign operations could be repatriated to the us although any repatriation under new us tax laws could be subject to incremental withholding taxes we do not expect current local laws other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

as of january 31 2018  and 2017  cash and cash equivalents of 14 billion  and 10 billion  respectively may not be freely transferable to the us due to local laws or other restrictions

we continued to focus on ecommerce including a seamless omnichannel shopping experience in each of our segments during fiscal 2018  our fiscal 2018  accomplishments in this area include growing online grocery to over 1100 pickup locations in the us new dedicated ecommerce fulfillment centers twoday free shipping with no membership fee at walmart us and onehour delivery from stores in china 

growth activities 

for the fiscal year ending january 31 2019  fiscal 2019  we project capital expenditures will be approximately 110 billion and involve 

 globally in fiscal 2019  we expect to add approximately 280 new expanded or relocated stores and clubs with approximately 255 of those in walmart international focusing on key markets such as mexico and china 

net cash used in financing activities 



net cash flows used in financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our shortterm and longterm debt financing obligations dividends paid and the repurchase of company stock transactions with noncontrolling interests are also classified as cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased 08 billion  and 28 billion  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2018  increased due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of debt net cash used in financing 

activities for fiscal 2017  increased primarily due to repurchases of company stock partially offset by lower repayments of longterm debt further discussion of financing activities is provided by major category below 

shortterm borrowings 

net cash flows provided by shortterm borrowings increased 41 billion  in fiscal 2018  and decreased 17 billion  in fiscal 2017  when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year we generally utilize the liquidity provided by shortterm borrowings to provide funding for our operations dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and other cash requirements for fiscal 2018  the additional cash provided by shortterm borrowings was primarily due to the timing of our january 2018 debt extinguishment for fiscal 2017  the decrease in net cash flows provided by shortterm borrowings was due to improved cash flows from operations driven by working capital improvements and changes to tax regulations 

the following table includes additional information related to the companys shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  



in addition to our shortterm borrowings we also have various undrawn committed lines of credit in the us that provide 125 billion  and various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the us that provide approximately 40 billion of additional liquidity if needed 

longterm debt 

the following table provides the changes in our longterm debt for fiscal 2018  

our total longterm debt decreased 45 billion  for fiscal 2018  primarily due to the extinguishment and maturities of certain longterm debt partially offset by the issuance of longterm debt the extinguishment of certain longterm debt allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods  

dividends 

our total dividend payments were 61 billion  62 billion  and 63 billion  for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively on february 20 2018  the board of directors approved the fiscal 2019  annual dividend of 208  per share an increase over the fiscal 2018  annual dividend of 204  per share for fiscal 2019  the annual dividend will be paid in four  quarterly installments of 052  per share according to the following record and payable dates 



company share repurchase program 

from time to time we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the companys board of directors all repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to november 20 2017 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2018  on october 9 2017 the board of directors approved a new 200 billion  share repurchase program which beginning on november 20 2017 replaced the previous share repurchase program as of january 31 2018  authorization for 188 billion  of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status 

we regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things current cash needs capacity for leverage cost of borrowings our results of operations and the market price of our common stock we anticipate that a significant majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be 

funded through the companys free cash flows the following table provides on a settlement date basis the number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  

share repurchases were flat for fiscal 2018  and increased 42 billion  for fiscal 2017  respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year 

significant transactions with noncontrolling interests 

in fiscal 2016 as described in note 13  to our consolidated financial statements we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in yihaodian our ecommerce operations in china for approximately 760 million using existing cash to complete the transaction the company subsequently sold yihaodian to jd in fiscal 2017 

capital resources 

we believe cash flows from operations our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures dividend payments and share repurchases 

we have strong commercial paper and longterm debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets at january 31 2018  the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding longterm debt were as follows 



credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the general economic environment conditions in the retail industry our financial position including our total debt and capitalization and changes in our business strategy any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us in addition any downgrade of our current shortterm credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing the credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments such as debt and lease agreements and certain contingent commitments as of january 31 2018  



 additionally the company has 125 billion  in undrawn committed lines of credit in the us and approximately 40 billion of undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the us which if drawn upon would be included in the current liabilities section of the companys consolidated balance sheets 

estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at january 31 2018  and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt 

purchase obligations include legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases as well as commitments to make capital expenditures software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction contracts that specify the company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity are excluded from the table above additionally purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

the expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above 10 billion  of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities the timing of the payment if any associated with these liabilities is uncertain refer to note 9  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits

summary of critical accounting estimates 

management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing the companys consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates 

management continually reviews our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the lastin firstout lifo method for walmart us segments inventories the inventory at the walmart international segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the firstin firstout fifo method the retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory the inventory at the sams club segment is valued using the weightedaverage cost lifo method 

under the retail method of accounting inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market which is determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to each merchandise groupings retail value the fifo costtoretail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity the costtoretail ratio for measuring any lifo provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns the retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit recognized judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage when management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand customer preferences and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion trends changes in weather and customer preferences could also cause changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year 

when necessary we record a lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices as a measure of sensitivity a 1 increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory at january 31 2018  and 2017  our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo 

we provide for estimated inventory losses or shrinkage between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales following annual inventory counts the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results historically our estimated inventory losses have been materially accurate when compared to annual inventory counts and we expect that trend to continue 

impairment of assets 

we evaluate longlived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable managements judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance the evaluation of longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in 

demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining the value of longlived assets is impaired resulting in a writedown of the related longlived assets although impairment charges for fiscal 2018  were 14 billion  these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in   note 14  as well as discontinued real estate projects in the us and decisions to exit certain international properties  impairment charges not related to restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 were not material and would not change materially with a 10 decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment additionally total impairment charges for fiscal   2017  were not material 

goodwill and other indefinitelived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative marketbased approach historically our reporting units and other indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinitelived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted for approximately 300 million of certain acquired indefinitelived intangible assets the fair value approximated the carrying value any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions accordingly the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies increases and decreases in valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our us and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the us statutory rate and may fluctuate as a result 

our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies this evaluation relies heavily on estimates 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act was enacted and contains significant changes to us income tax law effective in 2018 the tax act reduces the us statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates new taxes on foreignsourced earnings and relatedparty payments in addition the company was subject to a onetime transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the company recorded a net tax benefit of 02 billion  related to the enactment of the tax act the benefit primarily related to the remeasurement of the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the tax acts newly enacted tax rates and is net of the tax acts onetime transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of nonus subsidiaries as discussed in note 9  to our consolidated financial statements as the company collects and prepares necessary data and interprets the tax act and any additional guidance issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies the company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made the accounting for the tax effects of the tax act is provisional and will be completed by the measurement period provided in staff accounting bulletin no 118

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

the analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes the effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption in reality however a change in one factor could cause a change in another which may magnify or negate other sensitivities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt issuances we hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps for fiscal 2018  the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased approximately 87 million  primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for debt obligations the table represents the principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates for interest rate swaps the table represents the contractual cash flows and weightedaverage interest rates by the contractual maturity date unless otherwise noted the notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts the weightedaverage variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at january 31 2018  



 as of january 31 2018  our variable rate borrowings including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps represented 26  of our total shortterm and longterm debt based on january 31 2018  debt levels a 100  basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately 96 million  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the us for fiscal 2018  movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the companys subsidiaries in the united kingdom and canada were the primary cause of the 23 billion  gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreigncurrencydenominated longterm debt as net investment hedges 

we hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of nonus denominated debt the aggregate fair value of these swaps was in an asset position of 413 million  at january 31 2018  and a liability position of 147 million  at january 31 2017  the change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates primarily the strengthening of other currencies relative to the us dollar in fiscal 2018  a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate at january 31 2018  would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of 560 million  a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates underlying 

these swaps from the market rates in effect at january 31 2018  would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of 22 million  

in addition to currency swaps we have designated foreigncurrencydenominated longterm debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations we had outstanding longterm debt of £17 billion  at january 31 2018  and £25 billion  at january 31 2017  that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the united kingdom at january 31 2018  a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of 217 million  in addition we had outstanding longterm debt of ¥180 billion  at january 31 2018  and ¥10 billion  at january 31 2017  that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in japan at january 31 2018  a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in value of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of 150 million  

in certain countries we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in nonfunctional currencies 

investment risk 

during fiscal 2018  the fair value of our availableforsale investment in jd increased approximately 15 billion  due to an increase in the market value of jd

risk factors 

tableend

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally 

strategic risks 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may materially adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions and other economic factors globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates lower or higher prices of petroleum products including crude oil natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel higher costs for electricity and other energy weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes and surcharges or other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws other regulatory changes the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade overall economic slowdown and other economic factors in the us or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the us or such other markets change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

in addition the economic factors listed above any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation labor insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

the economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers demand for the products and services we sell our market share and the growth of our business 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings price transparency assortment of products customer experience convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products as a result of these factors we 

 17 

plan to increase investments in ecommerce technology store remodels and other customer initiatives moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on comparable store sales and ecommerce for growth any failure of these investments or initiatives to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the products we sell our market share and the growth of our business 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators whether through physical retail digital retail or the integration of both which could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our segments competes for customers employees store and club sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global retailers and wholesale club operators as well as other national and international internetbased retailers and retail intermediaries 

our walmart us segment competes with retailers operating discount department retail and wholesale grocers drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarkets as well as ecommerce and catalog businesses our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations and ecommerce retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses 

internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug dollar stores variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarkets wholesale clubs homeimprovement stores specialty electronics stores apparel stores wholesale clubs cash  carry operations convenience stores and ecommerce and catalog businesses 

we compete in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased online through mobile commerce applications or through the integration of our physical and digital retail operations 

where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale a failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance see  item 1 business  above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

failure to grow our ecommerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise and the cost of our increasing ecommerce investments may materially adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance 

the retail business is quickly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate we plan to increase our investments in ecommerce technology store remodels and other customer initiatives moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on increasing comparable store and club sales and ecommerce sales which are included in our calculation of comparable store and club sales with the exception of ecommerce acquisitions until such businesses have been owned for 12 months for growth the success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retail channels and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this item 1a  

our investments in ecommerce technology store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our ecommerce business increase comparable store sales maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings if we fail to successfully implement our strategy our market position net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected in addition a greater concentration of ecommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs which would in turn reduce the opportunities for crossstore or crossclub sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations 

 18 

in addition the cost of certain ecommerce and technology investments including any operating losses incurred by acquired ecommerce businesses will adversely impact our financial performance in the shortterm and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term 

operational risks 

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geopolitical events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located the unavailability of our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores 

these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur such as superstorm sandy in the us in 2012 or the numerous storm systems in the us in recent years and could adversely affect our financial performance 

in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily selfinsured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses from such causes we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor safety and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us 

political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet certain of our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the us currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control 

in addition the uss foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

if the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations we could lose customers incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our brand reputation and financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is 

 19 

outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food or nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our brand reputation and financial performance 

we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical information systems our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates our information systems are essential to our business operations including the processing of transactions management of our associates facilities logistics inventories physical stores and clubs and our online operations if our information systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim any interruption in both our information systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our ecommerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us over our ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications which are a part of our multichannel sales strategy increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our multichannel sales strategy in addition to home delivery we offer walmart pickup pickup today and club pickup and in a growing number of locations online grocery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs multichannel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the us and in a number of markets in which our walmart international segment operates 

we must anticipate and meet our customers changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment any failure on our part to provide attractive userfriendly secure ecommerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope and the computer systems and operating systems on which they run including those applications and systems in our acquired ecommerce businesses may be subject to cyberattacks those attacks could involve attempts to gain access to the website or mobile commerce application to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers or members payment information and related risks discussed below such attacks if successful can also create denials of service or otherwise disable degrade or sabotage one or more of our retail websites or mobile commerce applications and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers and members shopping experience on any of our retail website or mobile commerce applications if we are unable to maintain the security of our retail commerce websites and mobile commerce applications and keep them operating within acceptable parameters we could suffer loss of sales reductions in traffic reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business 

 20 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company customers members associates and vendors whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation result in litigation or other legal actions against us cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results 

as do most retailers we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications we also utilize thirdparty service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation for encryption and authentication technology content delivery to customers and members backoffice support and other functions such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers members associates or vendors in addition our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single hackers or small groups of hackers each year cyberattackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems we have in place substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to our information systems and the information stored on such systems we also have security processes protocols and standards that are applicable to our thirdparty service providers including cloud service providers to protect information from our systems which they have access to or hold under their engagements with us 

we constantly monitor developments in cyber threats evaluate the effectiveness of our information security measures and change such measures or implement new and additional security measures from time to time to address new and different risks to the security of such information and to strengthen our protections for the information stored on our systems we require our thirdparty service providers to do the same nevertheless as cyber threats evolve change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyberattacks might defeat our or a thirdparty service providers security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers members associates and vendors 

associate error or malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our thirdparty service providers security measures and a breach of our or their information systems moreover hardware software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs 

any breach of our security measures or any breach error or malfeasance of those of our thirdparty service providers and loss of our confidential information or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers members associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

in addition such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers members associates vendors and shareholders as well as our operations net sales results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital retail operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards our private label credit cards and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and the payment card industry data security standard even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any cyberattack or incursion in our or one of our thirdparty service providers information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of 

 21 

complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

the retail pharmacy operations in our walmart us and sams club segments generate substantial net sales a large majority of which are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment established through contractual relationship with thirdparty payers and payment administrators such as private insurers governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers pbms 

our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks including reductions in the thirdparty reimbursement rates for drugs changes in our payer mix ie shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms changes in third party payer drug formularies ie the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment growth in and our participation in or exclusion from exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by pbms andor any insurance plan or program increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell increases in the administrative burden associated with seeking thirdparty reimbursement changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition changes in drug mix ie the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics changes in the health insurance market generally changes in the scope of or the elimination of medicare part d or medicaid drug programs increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations further consolidation among third party payers pbms or purchasers of drugs overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act and other changes in laws rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business 

if the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of vendors were to be disrupted for any reason our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies 

one or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations and the net sales and gross margin of those operations result in the loss of crossstore or club selling opportunities and in turn adversely affect our overall net sales other results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected 

the wage increases for over 500000 associates in our operations in the us and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the us that we announced in february 2015 and related wage increases for 12 million associates occurring in february 2016 have increased our wage and other labor expenses significantly if we cannot offset the increases in our wage and other labor expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit achieving decreases in our operating selling general and administrative expense or a combination of both our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2017 in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

 22 

impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations and the performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of that segment could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes opening new units and growing comparable stores sales in the countries in which we have existing operations our ability to open new units or to expand or relocate existing units depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units 

in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods economic business and legal environments in foreign markets may also limit our ability to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want and could result in the closure of existing units in such markets which may adversely impact our financial results if we cannot effectively continue to expand our walmart international segment through opening new units growing comparable store sales or selective acquisitions our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected 

our walmart international segment may also enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our digital retail operations physical retail operations or both for example in fiscal 2017 we entered into a strategic alliance with jdcom inc providing for walmart china to be a preferred retailer on its onlinetooffline platform and our sams club business in china to be a flagship store on its marketplace any strategic alliance may not generate the level of ecommerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our business relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance in addition any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance such as our investment in jdcom inc could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

financial risks 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations 

our operations in countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period in recent years fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 

as a result of such translations fluctuations in currency exchange rates from periodtoperiod that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse periodoverperiod changes in our financial performance or reflecting a periodoverperiod improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

 23 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable store and club sales growth rates ecommerce growth rates gross margin or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies 

legal tax regulatory compliance reputational and other risks 

our operations subject us to legislative judicial accounting legal regulatory tax political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance 

in addition to our us operations we operate our retail business principally through whollyowned subsidiaries in argentina brazil canada chile china india japan and the united kingdom and our majorityowned subsidiaries in africa central america and mexico 

in fiscal 2017 our walmart us and sams club operating segments generated approximately 76  of our consolidated net sales the federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us and the imposition of a border tax or a border adjustment tax on imports into the us a significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our us stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise whether imported directly or indirectly and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our us operations and our business 

during fiscal 2017  our walmart international operations generated approximately 24  of our consolidated net sales our operating segments also source goods and services from other countries our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints local product safety and environmental laws tax regulations local labor laws antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future 

the potential imposition by the us of a border tax or border adjustment tax new or higher tariffs or other restrictions on trade discussed above which impact a country in which we have operations could result in actions by that country to impose new or increase existing tariffs or taxes on products imported into such country from the us or elsewhere and could damage the reputations of usbased companies including us with customers and others in that country this could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our operations in such country or countries 

our business and results of operations in the uk may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates increases in food costs changes in trade policies or changes in labor immigration tax or other laws resulting from the uks anticipated exit from the european union 

brazilian federal state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations although the company believes it complies with those laws the companys subsidiaries in brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and nonincome tax assessments which have arisen during the normal course of business in brazil these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the company could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anticorruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our 

 24 

associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation 

we are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated the us congress and the current federal administration have identified federal tax reform as a priority for 2017 federal tax reform plans under consideration may result in significant changes to the us tax code some of the changes contemplated by the us congress like the border tax or border adjustment tax could have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes and our overall tax liability and could reduce our net income and our earnings per share as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at which corporate taxable income is taxed in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation in particular we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws as well as a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws 

in addition asda stores ltd asda a whollyowned subsidiary of the company has been named as a defendant in nearly 10000 equal value claims pending in the manchester employment tribunal the employment tribunal in the united kingdom the claimants who are current and former asda store employees allege that the work performed by female employees in asdas retail stores is of equal value in terms of among other things the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in asdas warehouses and distribution facilities and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified the claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis at present we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings we discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption  item 3 legal proceedings  and in note 10 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and are included as an exhibit  to this annual report on form 10k 

we could be subject to liability penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our ongoing fcpa matter 

the audit committee of our board of directors has been conducting an internal investigation into among other things alleged violations of the fcpa and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries including walmart de méxico sab de cv walmex and whether prior allegations of such violations andor misconduct were appropriately handled by the company we have also been conducting a voluntary global review of our policies practices and internal controls for anticorruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anticorruption compliance programs since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anticorruption compliance programs the audit committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the fcpa 

inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential fcpa violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate including but not limited to brazil china and india in november 2011 we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the us department of justice the doj and the sec we have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters as discussions regarding resolution are preliminary we cannot currently predict the timing the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters furthermore lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of walmexs current and former officers 

 25 

we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the ongoing government investigations and such actions if brought may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other relief criminal convictions andor penalties the shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences moreover we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations 

while we believe it is probable we will incur a loss from these matters given the ongoing nature and complexity of the review inquiries and investigations we cannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss that may arise from the conclusion of these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future

risk factors 

tableend

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally 

strategic risks 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may materially adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates lower or higher prices of petroleum products including crude oil natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel higher costs for electricity and other energy weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes and surcharges other changes in tax laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods otherwise adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory 

higher levels of unemployment inflation deflation decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the us these conditions may adversely affect our net sales gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and consolidated operating results 

higher interest rates lower or higher prices of petroleum products including crude oil natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel higher costs for electricity and other energy higher transportation costs inflation higher commodity prices higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare currency exchange rate fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences whether involving physical retail digital retail or the integration of physical and digital retail which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings a critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency assortment of products customer experience convenience and the speed and cost of shipping these factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including the key factors described above and spending patterns whether for our physical retail offerings digital retail offerings or the integration of physical retail and digital retail could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

 17 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators whether through physical retail digital retail or through the integration of both areas which could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our segments competes for customers employees store and club sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global retailers and wholesale club operators as well as other national and international internetbased retailers and retail intermediaries our walmart us segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarkets as well as ecommerce and catalog businesses our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as ecommerce retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses 

internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug dollar stores variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarkets wholesale clubs homeimprovement stores specialty electronics stores apparel stores wholesale clubs cash  carry operations convenience stores and ecommerce and catalog businesses we compete with such retailers wholesale club operators and ecommerce retailers in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise the merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications cost and speed of and options for delivery to our customers of the merchandise they purchase from us online through mobile commerce applications and the integration of our physical locations with our digital retail operations 

where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance see item 1 business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result a greater portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs could occur online and through mobile commerce applications if we fail to maintain or grow our overall market position through the integration of our physical retail presence and digital retail our net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected in addition a greater concentration of retail and wholesale club sales in online and mobile commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic we have in our stores and clubs which would in turn reduce the opportunities for crossstore or crossclub sales of merchandise that such instore and inclub traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical side of our segments’ overall operations 

operational risks 

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geopolitical events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located the unavailability of our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur such as superstorm sandy in the us in 2012 or numerous winter storm systems in the us in 2013 2014 and 2015 and could adversely affect our financial performance 

 18 

in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily selfinsured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor safety and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us 

political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet certain of our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the us currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control 

in addition the uss foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

if the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations we could lose customers incur liability for any injuries suffered by our customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance 

we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical information systems our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our information systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both our information systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our information systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

 19 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our ecommerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us over our ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications including walmartcom and samsclubcom in the us and our retail websites in 10 other countries which are a part of our multichannel sales strategy increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our multichannel sales strategy we offer walmart pickup and club pickup and in a growing number of locations online grocery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs multichannel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the us and in a number of markets in which our walmart international segment operates 

we must anticipate and meet our customers changing expectations while adjusting for new developments and technology investments by our competitors through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment any failure on our part to provide attractive userfriendly ecommerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company customers members associates and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers members associates vendors and others could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially adversely affect our operating results 

as do most retailers we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors we also utilize thirdparty service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom wwwsamsclubcom and our websites in certain of our foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments each year cyberattackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information and have security processes protocols and standards that are applicable to our thirdparty service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us 

however we or our thirdparty service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which cyberattackers may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers and breach our or our thirdparty service providers information systems during fiscal 2016 we were notified that a third party service provider that hosts the online photo center for walmart canada suffered a security breach that compromised information of users of that companys site including some walmart canada customers which we believe has not had a material impact on walmart canada or the company walmart canada discontinued use of this third party service provider sams club in the united states also used the same third party service provider to host its online photo center through a different system than the one used by walmart canada after the breach in canada sams club suspended the operation of the online photo center until a security review could be completed by the third party service provider once the security review was complete and new technology with enhanced security measures was implemented by the third party service provider along with a determination that the information of sams club members was not compromised by the security breach sams club resumed the operation of the online photo center through the same third party service provider 

cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers in the future like the incident referenced above and obtain the personal information of customers members associates and vendors that we hold or to which our thirdparty service providers have access and we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs moreover associate error or malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our thirdparty service providers security measures and breach our or our thirdparty service providers information systems whether digital or otherwise 

 20 

any breach of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers and loss of our confidential information which could be undetected for a period of time or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers and members whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer and member confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

in addition such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers members associates vendors and shareholders as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital retail operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards our private label cards and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications by accepting debit and credit cards as a retailer for payment we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard pci dss issued by the payment card industry security standards council pci dss contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data the payment card industry set october 1 2015 as the date on which it will shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept europay mastercard visa emv chip card credit and debit transactions while we already accept many emv cards if we are unable to fully implement emv as planned we may incur increased costs associated with the liability shift by accepting debit cards for payment we are also subject to compliance with the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines even though we comply with these guidelines and standards and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any disruption results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in addition the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected 

the wage increases for over 500000 associates in our operations in the us and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the us that we announced in february 2015 and related wage increases for 12 million associates aggregating 15 billion in the year ending january 31 2017 fiscal 2017 will increase our wage and other labor expenses significantly if we cannot offset the increases in our wage expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit achieving decreases in our operating selling general and administrative expense or a combination of both in the year ending january 31 2018 and thereafter our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2017 in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

 21 

we may face impediments to our expansion of physical retail in the us which may materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our expansion strategy in the us depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the us and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other store formats and sams clubs depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local real estate land use zoning and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states including in market areas in which we have no existing operations 

increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters moreover our expansion in our existing local market areas may be limited if the opening of new stores or clubs would result in an unacceptable level of cannibalization of the sales of existing stores or clubs if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other small formats or sams clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be materially adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand or in which we build stores of a new format are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected 

impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sams clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the us our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods 

moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve economic business and legal environments in foreign markets may be such that we are unable to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want to do and could result in the closure of our existing units in such markets which closures impede the growth of our international operations finally some countries have foreign investment laws that prohibit us or limit us from holding a controlling interest in retail operations in those countries making our entry into those markets which may present attractive growth opportunities more difficult if not impossible if we cannot effectively continue to expand our walmart international segment our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance 

financial risks 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations 

our operations in countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period in recent years fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of 

 22 

operations as a result of such translations fluctuations in currency exchange rates from periodtoperiod that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse periodoverperiod changes in our financial performance or reflecting a periodoverperiod improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable store and club sales growth rates ecommerce growth rates gross margin earnings and earnings per share or new store and club openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies 

regulatory compliance reputational and other risks 

our operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance 

we are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our whollyowned subsidiaries operating in argentina brazil canada chile china india japan and the united kingdom our majorityowned subsidiaries operating in africa central america and mexico and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in china in addition to our us operations during fiscal 2016  our walmart international operations generated approximately 26  of our consolidated net sales our divisions also source goods and services from other countries the future expansion of our operations in countries outside the us could result in our international operations accounting for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints local product safety and environmental laws tax regulations local labor laws antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future 

in particular brazilian federal state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations although the company believes it complies with those laws the companys subsidiaries in brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and nonincome tax assessments which have arisen during the normal course of business in brazil these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the company could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anticorruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our 

 23 

policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation 

we are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation in particular we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws as well as a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws 

in addition asda stores ltd asda a whollyowned subsidiary of the company has been named as a defendant in over 7000 equal value claims that are pending in the manchester employment tribunal the employment tribunal in the united kingdom the claimants who are current and former asda store employees allege that the work performed by female employees in asdas retail stores is of equal value in terms of among other things the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in asdas warehouses and distribution facilities and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified the claimants are seeking i back pay consisting of the difference between the wage rate paid in the stores and the rate paid in the warehouses and distribution facilities for the period of their employment up to a maximum of six years under the statute of limitations and ii an increase in the store rate prospectively to match that paid in the warehouses and the distribution facilities on january 30 2015 the employment tribunal held a case management conference in order to set a schedule for addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issues involved in the first phase of the litigation at this time it is undetermined i how many of these claims may ultimately be filed or ii whether the employment tribunal will decide to hear each claim individually or to consolidate them into groups of similar claims and proceed with the trial of test cases determinations made in such test cases if any might be asserted as binding in subsequent trials of claims within that group and any subsequent claims involving the same issues moreover a determination as to the appropriate rate of pay for a particular store position might be asserted as the basis for additional claims for back pay or wage increases by other store associates who perform or who have performed like work in that position 

on march 23 2015 asda asked the employment tribunal to stay all proceedings contending that the high court which is the superior first instance civil court in the uk that is headquartered in the royal courts of justice in the city of london is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims on march 23 2015 asda also asked the employment tribunal to strike out substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with employment tribunal rules following argument and appellate proceedings the claims have remained in the employment tribunal the issue of stay strike out and the scope of employment tribunal rules are the subject of further appellate proceedings we discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption item 3 legal proceedings and in note 10 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k

we could be subject to liability penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our ongoing fcpa matter 

the audit committee of our board of directors which is composed solely of independent directors is conducting an internal investigation into among other things alleged violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries including walmart de méxico sab de cv or walmex and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations andor misconduct we are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies practices and internal controls for fcpa compliance and strengthening our global anticorruption compliance programs since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anticorruption compliance programs the audit committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the fcpa inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential fcpa violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate including but not limited to brazil china and india in november 2011 we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the us department of justice the doj and the sec and we have been informed by the doj and the sec that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the fcpa a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters furthermore lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of walmexs current and former officers 

we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the ongoing government investigations and such actions if brought may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other relief criminal convictions andor penalties the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings we cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations the shareholder lawsuits or our own internal investigations and review moreover we expect to continue to incur costs incremental to the 126 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2016 and the costs incurred in prior years in conducting our ongoing review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers these matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues while we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters given the ongoing nature and complexity of the review inquiries and investigations we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information which is required to be timely disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures we recognize that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures also we have investments in unconsolidated entities since we do not control or manage those entities our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment changes may include such activities as implementing new more efficient systems updating existing systems automating manual processes migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls these changes have not materially affected and are not reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting however they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective 

an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the secs rules and forms 

reports on internal control over financial reporting 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of ernst  young llp the companys independent registered public accounting firm on the companys internal control over financial reporting are incorporated herein by reference to all information under the captions managements report to our shareholders and report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting respectively included in our annual report to shareholders such information is included in exhibit 13 to this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we identified and disclosed a material weakness in our controls over accounting for leases the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting resulted from a lack of controls which allowed for the misinterpretation and historical misapplication of accounting standards codification 840 leases  asc 840 regarding saleleaseback accounting primarily lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets specifically we did not have adequate controls in place to properly identify and account for leases that were subject to the saleleaseback accounting guidance primarily leases in which we made payments for certain structural components included in the lessors construction of the leased assets which should have resulted in the company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes to remediate the material weakness described above we designed and implemented controls and enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures to properly apply saleleaseback accounting primarily lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets under asc 840 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated 

except as noted above there has been no change in the companys internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2016  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting

risk factors 

tableend

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally 

global and domestic economic risks and consumer demand risks 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may materially adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes and surcharges other changes in tax laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher levels of unemployment inflation deflation decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the us these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and consolidated operating results 

higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare currency exchange rate fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences whether involving physical retail digital retail or a combination of both retail offerings which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings a critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency assortment of products customer experience and convenience these factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including the key factors described above and spending patterns whether for our physical retail offerings digital retail offerings or a combination of these retail offerings could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations 

our operations in countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result of such translations future fluctuations in currency exchange rate over time that are unfavorable to us may result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse periodoverperiod changes in our financial performance such unfavorable currency exchange rate 

 20 

fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse affect on our reported consolidated results of operations 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of goods sold may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

capital investment and information systems risks 

we may face impediments to our expansion in the us including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats which may adversely affect our financial performance 

our expansion strategy in the us depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the us and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other store formats and sams clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local real estate land use zoning and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other small formats or sams clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected 

impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sams clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the us our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our walmart international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance 

we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical information systems our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our information systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant 

 21 

investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both our information systems and backup systems may have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our information systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

competitive and reputational risks 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected the wage increases for over 500000 associates in our operations in the us and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the us that we announced in february 2015 will increase our wage and other labor expenses significantly if the combined impact of the increase in our gross profit and decrease in certain operating expenses in fiscal 2015 and thereafter does not offset the additional wage expense our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for recent fiscal years in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators whether through physical retail digital retail or through a combination of both areas which could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global retailers as well as other national and international internetbased retailers our walmart us segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarkets as well as ecommerce and catalog businesses our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug dollar stores variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarkets wholesale clubs ecommerce and catalog businesses such retailers wholesale club operators and ecommerce retailers compete in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise the merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications speed of and options for delivery to our customers of the merchandise they purchase from us online and the integration of our physical locations with our digital retail operations where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance see item 1 business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our ecommerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us over our ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications including walmartcom and samsclubcom which are a part of our multichannel sales strategy increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our multichannel sales strategy we offer walmart pickup and club pickup programs under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs multichannel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the us and in a number of markets in which our walmart international segment operates any failure on our part to provide attractive userfriendly ecommerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

data and privacy risks 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company customers associates and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers associates vendors and others could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially adversely affect our operating results 

as do most retailers we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors we also utilize thirdparty service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom wwwsamsclubcom and our websites in certain of our foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments each year computer hackers cyber terrorists and others make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information and have security processes protocols and standards that are applicable to our thirdparty service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us 

as a result of these measures and our monitoring processes and procedures we believe that past attempts by computer hackers cyber terrorists and others to gain access to the information stored on our information systems have been unsuccessful however we or our thirdparty service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which computer hackers cyber terrorists and others may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers and breach our or our thirdparty service providers information systems cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers in the future and obtain the personal information of customers associates and vendors that we hold or to which our thirdparty service providers have access and we or our thirdparty service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs moreover associate error or malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our thirdparty service providers’ security measures and breach our or our thirdparty service providers information systems whether digital or otherwise 

any breach of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers and loss of our confidential information which could be undetected for a period of time or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

in addition such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers associates vendors and shareholders as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital retail operations 

 23 

as a retailer who accepts debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard pci dss issued by the payment card industry security standards council pci dss contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data by accepting debit cards for payment we are also subject to compliance with the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines even though we comply with these guidelines and standards and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any disruption results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in addition the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

supply chain and thirdparty risks 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor safety and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the us currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the uss foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance 

legal regulatory and other external risks 

our walmart international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business or financial performance 

we are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our whollyowned subsidiaries operating in argentina brazil canada chile china india japan and the united kingdom our majorityowned subsidiaries operating in africa central america china and mexico and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal 2015  our walmart international operations generated approximately 28  of our consolidated net sales as a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the us we expect that our walmart international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tax regulations local labor laws antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future 

in particular brazilian federal state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations although the company believes it complies with those laws the companys subsidiaries in brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and nonincome tax assessments which have arisen during the normal course of business in brazil these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the company could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other 

 24 

factors which may impact our walmart international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our walmart international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anticorruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance 

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geopolitical events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur such as superstorm sandy in the us in 2012 or numerous winter storm systems in the us in 2013 2014 and 2015 and could adversely affect our financial performance 

in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily selfinsured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws as well as a number of cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws in addition asda stores ltd asda a whollyowned subsidiary of the company has been named as a defendant in over 4000 equal value claims that are pending in the manchester employment tribunal the employment tribunal in the united kingdom the claimants who are current and former asda store employees allege that the work performed by female employees in asdas retail stores is of equal value in terms of among other things the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in asdas warehouses and distribution facilities and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified the claimants are seeking i back pay consisting of the difference between the wage rate paid in the stores and the rate paid in the warehouses and distribution facilities for the period of their employment up to a maximum of six years under the statute of limitations and ii an increase in the store rate prospectively to match that paid in the warehouses and the

distribution facilities on january 30 2015 the employment tribunal held a case management conference in order to set a schedule for addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issues involved in the first phase of the litigation at this time it is undetermined i how many of these claims may ultimately be filed or ii whether the employment tribunal will decide to hear each claim individually or to consolidate them into groups of similar claims and proceed with the trial of test cases determinations made in such test cases if any might be asserted as binding in subsequent trials of claims within that group and any subsequent claims involving the same issues moreover a determination as to the appropriate rate of pay for a particular store position might be asserted as the basis for additional claims for back pay or wage increases by other store associates who perform or who have performed like work in that position on march 23 2015 asda asked the employment tribunal to stay all proceedings contending that the high court which is the superior first instance civil court in the uk that is headquartered in the royal courts of justice in the city of london is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims on march 23 2015 asda also asked the employment tribunal to strike out substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with employment tribunal rules we discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption item 3 legal proceedings and in note 10 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

we could be subject to liability penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our ongoing fcpa matter 

the audit committee of our board of directors which is composed solely of independent directors is conducting an internal investigation into among other things alleged violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries including walmart de méxico sab de cv or walmex and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations andor misconduct we are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies practices and internal controls for fcpa compliance and strengthening our global anticorruption compliance programs since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anticorruption compliance programs the audit committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the fcpa inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential fcpa violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate including but not limited to brazil china and india in november 2011 we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the us department of justice the doj and the sec and we have been informed by the doj and the sec that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the fcpa a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters furthermore lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of walmexs current and former officers 

we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the ongoing government investigations and such actions if brought may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other relief criminal convictions andor penalties the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings we cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations the shareholder lawsuits or our own internal investigations and review moreover we expect to continue to incur costs incremental to the 173 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2015 in conducting our ongoing review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers these matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues while we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters given the ongoing nature and complexity of the review inquiries and investigations we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse affect on our business given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future

in the ordinary course of business we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment changes may include such activities as implementing new more efficient systems updating existing systems automating manual processes migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls these changes have not materially affected and are not reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting however they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective 

an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the secs rules and forms

risk factors 

tableend

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes and surcharges other changes in tax laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher levels of unemployment inflation deflation decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the us these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and consolidated operating results 

higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare currency exchange rate fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences whether involving physical retail ecommerce retail or a combination of both retail offerings which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs through our ecommerce businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings a critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency assortment of products customer experience and convenience these factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including the key factors described above and spending patterns whether for our physical retail offerings ecommerce offerings or through a combination of these retail offerings could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

 16 

we may face impediments to our expansion in the us including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats which may adversely affect our financial performance 

our expansion strategy in the us depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the us and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other store formats and sams clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local real estate land use zoning and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other small formats or sams clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected 

impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sams clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the us our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our walmart international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 17 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators whether through physical retail ecommerce retail or through a combination of both areas which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global retailers our walmart us segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarkets as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug dollar stores variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarkets wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see item 1 business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor safety and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the uss foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance

our walmart international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business or financial performance 

we are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our whollyowned subsidiaries operating in argentina brazil canada china india japan and the united kingdom our majorityowned subsidiaries operating in africa central america chile china and mexico and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal 2014  our walmart international operations generated approximately 29  of our consolidated net sales as a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the us we expect that our walmart international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our walmart international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our walmart international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our walmart international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anticorruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geopolitical events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur such as the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan superstorm sandy in the us in 2012 or numerous winter storm systems in the us in 2013 and 2014 and could adversely affect our financial performance 

in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily selfinsured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v walmart stores inc  which was commenced as a classaction lawsuit in june 2001 in the united states district court for the northern district of california asserting that the company had engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seeking among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys fees on june 21 2004 the us district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification as defined by the us district court the class included all women employed at any walmart domestic retail store at any time since december 26 1998 who have been or may be subjected to walmarts challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices the company appealed the order to the ninth circuit court of appeals and subsequently to the united states supreme court on june 20 2011 the supreme court issued an opinion decertifying the class and remanding the case to the district court on october 27 2011 the plaintiffs attorneys filed an amended complaint proposing a class of current and former female associates at the companys california retail facilities and the company filed a motion to dismiss on january 13 2012 on september 21 2012 the court denied the motion the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on april 15 2013 on august 2 2013 the court denied the motion on august 16 2013 the plaintiffs filed a petition for permission to appeal that ruling to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit on november 18 2013 the ninth circuit denied that petition on october 28 2011 the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the dukes  case filed a similar complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of texas entitled odle v walmart stores inc  proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in any walmart region that includes stores located in the state of texas on october 15 2012 the court in the  odle  case granted the companys motion to dismiss dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs classaction allegations and the individual claims of the lead plaintiff stephanie odle on march 19 2013 the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit denied the plaintiffs petition for permission to appeal on october 2 2012 the plaintiffs attorneys filed another similar complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee entitled phipps v walmart stores inc  proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in region 43 centered in middle and western tennessee on february 20 2013 the court in the phipps  case granted the companys motion to dismiss dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs classaction allegations on september 11 2013 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit granted the plaintiffs petition for permission to appeal that ruling on october 4 2012 the plaintiffs attorneys filed another similar complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of florida entitled love v walmart stores inc  proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in certain designated stores and clubs in regions centered in the state of florida on september 23 2013 the court in

we could be subject to liability penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our ongoing fcpa matter 

the audit committee of our board of directors which is composed solely of independent directors is conducting an internal investigation into among other things alleged violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries including walmart de méxico sab de cv or walmex and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations andor misconduct we are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies practices and internal controls for fcpa compliance and strengthening our global anticorruption compliance programs since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anticorruption compliance programs the audit committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the fcpa inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential fcpa violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate including but not limited to brazil china and india in november 2011 we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the us department of justice the doj and the sec and we have been informed by the doj and the sec that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the fcpa a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters furthermore lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of walmexs current and former officers 

we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the ongoing government investigations and such actions if brought may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other relief criminal convictions andor penalties the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings we cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations the shareholder lawsuits or our own internal investigations and review moreover we expect to continue to incur costs incremental to the 282 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2014 in conducting our ongoing review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers these matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues while we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters given the ongoing nature and complexity of the review inquiries and investigations we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse affect on our business given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our ecommerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us over our merchandising websites including walmartcom and samsclubcom which are a part of our multichannel sales strategy increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our multichannel sales strategy we offer a sitetostore program under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs any failure on our part to provide attractive userfriendly online merchandising platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of online and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our customers associates and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers associates vendors and others could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially adversely affect our operating results 

as do most retailers we receive and store certain personal information about our customers in our information systems and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors we also utilize use thirdparty service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom wwwsamsclubcom and other websites depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments each year computer hackers cyber terrorists and others make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information and have security processes protocols and standards that are applicable to our thirdparty service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us as a result of these measures and our monitoring processes and procedures we believe that past attempts by computer hackers cyber terrorists and others to gain access to the information stored on our information systems have been unsuccessful nevertheless it is possible that computer hackers cyber terrorists and others through cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated or by other means might defeat our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers in the future and obtain the personal information of customers associates and vendors that we hold any breach of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers and loss of our confidential information which could be undetected for a period of time or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

in addition such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers associates and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

as a retailer who accepts debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard pci dss issued by the pci council pci dss contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data despite our compliance with these standards and other information security measures we cannot be certain that all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any disruption results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations and others in addition the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

 22 

we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical information systems our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our information systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both our information systems and backup systems may have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our information systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information which is required to be timely disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures we recognize that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures also we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities since we do not control or manage those entities our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment changes may include such activities as implementing new more efficient systems automating manual processes and updating existing systems for example we are currently implementing various new financial system applications in stages across the company to date we have completed significant implementations in argentina canada central america japan mexico the united kingdom and the united states as these financial system applications are implemented they become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting we will continue to implement and update our financial system applications in stages and each implementation may become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting additionally we are currently establishing shared service functions and processes on a global scale the implementation of our global shared services is in the beginning stages and we believe the related changes to processes and internal controls will allow us to be more efficient and further enhance our internal control over financial reporting

risk factors 

tableend

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

general or macroeconomic factors both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance in the us higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes and surcharges other changes in tax laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our walmart us segment and sams club segment change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher levels of unemployment inflation deflation decreases in consumer disposable income changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the us these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our walmart international segment 

higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the us and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we may face impediments to our expansion in the us including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats which may adversely affect our financial performance 

our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the us and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other store formats and sams clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other small formats or sams clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 17 

impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sams clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the us our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our walmart international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance 

our failure to attract and retain qualified associates changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 18 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers our walmart us segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarkets as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug dollar stores variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarkets wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see item 1 business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor safety and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the us political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the uss foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance 

 19 

our walmart international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business or financial performance 

we are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our whollyowned subsidiaries in argentina brazil canada china japan and the united kingdom our majorityowned subsidiaries in africa central america chile china and mexico our joint ventures in india and china and other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal 2013  our walmart international operations generated approximately 29  of our consolidated net sales as a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the us we expect that our walmart international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints antimoney laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our walmart international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our walmart international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the us and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the us additional risks inherent in our walmart international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by us laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anticorruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such us laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance 

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geopolitical events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur such as the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan or superstorm sandy in the us in 2012 and could adversely affect our financial performance 

in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily selfinsured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages

we could be subject to liability penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our ongoing fcpa matter 

the audit committee of our board of directors which is composed solely of independent directors is conducting an internal investigation into among other things alleged violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries including walmart de méxico sab de cv or walmex and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations andor misconduct we are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies practices and internal controls for fcpa compliance and strengthening our global anticorruption compliance programs since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anticorruption compliance programs the audit committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the fcpa inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential fcpa violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate including but not limited to brazil china and india in november 2011 we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the us department of justice the doj and the sec and we have been informed by the doj and the sec that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the fcpa a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters furthermore lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of walmexs current and former officers 

we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the ongoing government investigations and such actions if brought may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other relief criminal convictions andor penalties the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings we cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations the shareholder lawsuits or our own internal investigations and review moreover we expect to continue to incur costs in addition to the 157 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2013 in conducting our ongoing review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers these matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues while we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters given the ongoing nature and complexity of the review inquiries and investigations we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our global ecommerce business could be adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us over our merchandising websites including walmartcom and samsclubcom which are a part of our multichannel sales strategy increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping in addition we offer a sitetostore program under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local walmart store or sams club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs any failure on our part to provide the necessary technological interfaces with our merchandising programs including user friendly software applications for smart phones and tablets could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of online and other sales harm our reputation with customers have an adverse impact on the growth of our global ecommerce business and negatively affect our results of operations

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our customers associates and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers associates and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could adversely affect our operating results 

as do most retailers we receive certain personal information about our customers and we also receive personal information concerning our associates and vendors in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom  wwwsamsclubcom  and other websites depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments each year computer hackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information as a result of those measures the past attempts by computer hackers to gain access to the information stored on our information systems have been unsuccessful nevertheless it is possible that computer hackers and others through cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated or by other means might defeat our security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers associates and vendors that we hold such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers associates and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our computer systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share

currently our operations comprise three reportable business segments the walmart us segment the walmart international segment and the sam’s club segment 

our walmart us segment is the largest segment of our business accounting for approximately 60 of our fiscal 2012 net sales and operates retail stores in various formats in all 50 states in the us and puerto rico as well as walmart’s online retail operations walmartcom

the development of our company 

although walmart was incorporated in delaware in october 1969 the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when sam m walton opened a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport arkansas in 1946 his brother james l walton opened a similar store in versailles missouri until 1962 our founders’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores in that year the first walmart discount city which was a discount store opened in rogers arkansas in fiscal 1984 we opened our first three sam’s clubs and in fiscal 1988 we opened our first supercenter in fiscal 1999 we opened our first neighborhood market

 item 1a  risk factors tableend the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the united states and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

general economic factors both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance in the united states higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the housing market inflation deflation higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our walmart us segment and sam’s club segment change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher levels of unemployment inflation deflation decreases in consumer disposable income changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than in the united states these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our walmart international segment 

higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the united states and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we may face impediments to our expansion in the united states including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats which may adversely affect our financial performance 

our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other store formats and sam’s clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel 

  

and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other small formats or sam’s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected 

impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sam’s clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the united states our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our walmart international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance 

failure to attract and retain qualified associates changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations are adopted our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart us segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarkets as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sam’s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug dollar stores variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarkets wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club 

  

operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see “item 1 business” above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transportation availability and cost transportation security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance 

our walmart international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we currently conduct operations in 12 countries in africa argentina brazil canada chile china 5 countries in central america japan mexico and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china and india and our other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal 2012 our walmart international operations generated approximately 28 of our net sales as a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the united states we expect that our walmart international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints trade policies both of the united states and of the other countries in which we operate currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our walmart international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our walmart international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our walmart international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

  

natural disasters and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornados whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geopolitical events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution centers the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distributions centers are located changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers’ disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur such as the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan and could adversely affect our financial performance 

in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily selfinsured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v walmart stores inc  which was commenced as a classaction lawsuit in june 2001 in the united states district court for the northern district of california asserting that the company had engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seeking among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys’ fees on june 21 2004 the us district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification as defined by the us district court the class included “all women employed at any walmart domestic retail store at any time since december 26 1998 who have been or may be subjected to walmart’s challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices” the company appealed the order to the ninth circuit court of appeals and subsequently to the united states supreme court on june 20 2011 the supreme court issued an opinion decertifying the class and remanding the case to the district court on october 27 2011 the plaintiffs’ attorneys filed an amended complaint proposing a class of current and former female associates at the company’s california retail facilities and the company filed a motion to dismiss on january 13 2012 on october 28 2011 the plaintiffs’ attorneys filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of texas entitled odle v walmart stores inc  proposing a class of current and former female associates at the company’s texas retail facilities and asserting claims and relief similar to those in the dukes case the company filed a motion to dismiss on march 5 2012 we discuss this case and other litigation to which we are a party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 11 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

  

if we do not maintain the security of information relating to our customers associates and vendors security information breaches through cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers associates and vendors and we could incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

as do most retailers we receive certain personal information about our customers and we also receive personal information concerning our associates and vendors in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom  wwwsamsclubcom and other websites depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments we maintain security measures with respect to such information but despite these measures we may be vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and others that attempt to penetrate the security measures that we have in place a compromise of our security systems through cyberattacks or otherwise which are rapidly evolving and sophisticated that results in personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers associates and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our computer systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the united states and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

general economic factors both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance in the united states higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the housing market inflation deflation higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our walmart us segment and sam’s club segment change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher levels of unemployment inflation deflation decreases in consumer disposable income changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than in the united states these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our walmart international segment 

  

higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rates fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the united states and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

we may face impediments to our expansion in the united states including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats which may adversely affect our financial performance 

our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other store formats and sam’s clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other small formats or sam’s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected 

impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sam’s clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the united states our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our walmart international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance 

  

failure to attract and retain qualified associates changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations are adopted our financial performance could be affected adversely 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart us segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarts as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sam’s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see “item 1 business” above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

our walmart international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we currently conduct operations in argentina brazil canada chile costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras japan mexico nicaragua and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china and india and our other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal 2011 our walmart international operations generated 261 of our net sales as a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the united states we expect that our walmart international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints trade policies both of the united states and of the other countries in which we operate currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our walmart international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our walmart international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our walmart international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

natural disasters and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornados whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geopolitical events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution centers the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distributions centers are located changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers’ disposable income the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan and could adversely affect our financial performance 

in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily selfinsured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages 

  

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v walmart stores inc  a classaction lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states the class as certified in dukes currently includes present and former female associates the plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seek among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys’ fees on june 4 2004 the us district court hearing this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification which we have appealed on february 6 2007 a divided threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued a decision affirming the district court’s certification order on february 20 2007 the company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the court of appeals on december 11 2007 the threejudge panel withdrew its opinion of february 6 2007 and issued a revised opinion as a result the company’s petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot the company filed a new petition for rehearing en banc on january 8 2008 on february 13 2009 the court of appeals issued an order granting the petition on april 26 2010 the ninth circuit issued a divided 65 opinion affirming certain portions of the district court’s ruling and reversing other portions on august 25 2010 the company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court seeking review of the ninth circuit’s decision which was granted by the united states supreme court on december 6 2010 the company filed its brief for petitioner on january 20 2011 the brief for respondents was filed on february 22 2011 and oral argument was held on march 29 2011 we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

if we do not maintain the security of customerrelated information we could damage our reputation with customers incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

as do most retailers we receive certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom and wwwsamsclubcom depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our computer systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

  

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the united states and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

general economic factors both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance in the united states higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the housing market inflation deflation higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our walmart us segment and sam’s club segment change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher levels of unemployment inflation deflation decreases in consumer disposable income changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than in the united states these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our international segment 

higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rates fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the united states and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

  

we may face impediments to our expansion in the united states including conversions of discount stores into supercenters which may adversely affect our financial performance 

our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets and sam’s clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets or sam’s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected 

impediments to the expansion of our international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sam’s clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the united states our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our international segment and our future financial performance 

failure to attract and retain qualified associates changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations are adopted our financial performance could be affected adversely 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart us segment competes with 

  

retailers operating discount department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarts as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sam’s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs including edlp rollbacks and store of the community have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see “item 1 business” above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we currently conduct operations in argentina brazil canada chile costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras japan mexico nicaragua puerto rico and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china and india and our other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal 2010 our international operations generated 247 of our net sales as a result of our expansion activities in foreign countries we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints trade policies both of the united states and of the other countries in which we operate currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

natural disasters and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes floods and earthquakes other weather conditions whether as a result of climate change or otherwise such as major winter storms droughts and tornados and geopolitical events such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located or terrorist attacks both internationally and domestically could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution centers the lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

the significant property damage experienced by the company and others resulting from the hurricanes in fiscal year 2006 resulted in substantial increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others the insurance coverage offered to the company for named windstorms such as hurricanes and tropical storms was substantially more limited and carried higher premiums than the coverage previously available to us as a result the company has chosen to be primarily selfinsured for losses that may result from named windstorms 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v walmart stores inc  a classaction lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states the class as certified in dukes currently includes present and former female associates the plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seek among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys’ fees on june 4 2004 the us district court hearing this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification which we have appealed on february 6 2007 a divided threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld the district court’s ruling on february 20 2007 the company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the court of appeals on november 11 2007 the threejudge panel withdrew its opinion of february 6 2007 and issued a revised opinion as a result the company’s petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot the company filed a new petition for rehearing en banc on january 8 2008 on february 13 2009 the court of appeals issued an order granting the petition the court of appeals heard oral argument on the petition on march 24 2009 we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

if we do not maintain the security of customerrelated information we could damage our reputation with customers incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

as do most retailers we receive certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom and wwwsamsclubcom depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in 

  

litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business implementation of a new financial system in fiscal year 2011 if not properly completed could make financial information unavailable on a timely basis and delay our financial reporting 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our computer systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 we expect to implement a new financial system in our us canada and puerto rico operations the implementation of this new financial system relates to the largest portion of our business and will be a significant component of our internal controls over financial reporting if the new financial system does not function properly upon implementation we may be unable to produce information as needed to manage our business most efficiently or to accumulate and report financial information on a timely basis 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share

risk factors 

tableend 

 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the united states and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

 

general economic factors both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance in the united states higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the housing market inflation higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our walmart us segment and sam’s club segment change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher levels of unemployment inflation decreases in consumer disposable income changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than in the united states these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our international segment 

 

 

higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rates fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the united states and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale 

 

we may face impediments to our expansion in the united states including conversions of discount stores into supercenters which may adversely affect our financial performance 

 

our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets and sam’s clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets or sam’s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

impediments to the expansion of our international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

our business strategy for our international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sam’s clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the united states our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our international segment and our future financial performance 

 

failure to attract and retain qualified associates changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations are adopted our financial performance could be affected adversely 

 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart us segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarts as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sam’s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs including edlp rollbacks store within a store and store of the community have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see “item 1 business” above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments 

 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

we currently conduct operations in argentina brazil canada chile costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras japan mexico nicaragua puerto rico and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china and india and our other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal 2009 our international operations generated 246 of our net sales as a result of a recent acquisition of operations and our expansion activities in foreign countries we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints trade policies both of the united states and of the other countries in which we operate currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

 

natural disasters and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes floods and earthquakes other weather conditions such as major winter storms and geopolitical events such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located or terrorist attacks both internationally and domestically could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution centers the lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

 

the significant property damage experienced by the company and others resulting from the hurricanes in fiscal year 2006 resulted in substantial increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others the insurance coverage offered to the company for named windstorms such as hurricanes and tropical storms was substantially more limited and carried higher premiums than the coverage previously available to us as a result the company has chosen to be primarily selfinsured for losses that may result from named windstorms 

 

 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v walmart stores inc  a classaction lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states the class as certified in dukes currently includes present and former female associates the plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seek among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys’ fees on june 4 2004 the us district court hearing this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification which we have appealed on february 6 2007 a divided threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld the district court’s ruling on february 20 2007 the company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the court of appeals on november 11 2007 the threejudge panel withdrew its opinion of february 6 2007 and issued a revised opinion as a result the company’s petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot the company filed a new petition for rehearing en banc on january 8 2008 on february 13 2009 the court of appeals issued an order granting the petition the court of appeals heard oral argument on the petition on march 24 2009 we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

 

if we do not maintain the security of customerrelated information we could damage our reputation with customers incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

 

as do most retailers we receive certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom and wwwsamsclubcom depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our computer systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share

a majority of sales numerous store brands not found in the united states have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the international segment operates in addition steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the united states and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

general economic factors both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance in the united states higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the housing market inflation higher levels of unemployment unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our walmart stores segment and sam’s club segment change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rates fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the united states can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect the operations and operating results of our walmart stores segment and sam’s club segment these factors affect not only our operations but also the operations of suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers higher levels of unemployment inflation changes in tax and other laws currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries especially those in which average incomes are significantly lower than in the united states these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our international segment 

we may face impediments to our expansion in the united states including conversions of discount stores into supercenters which may adversely affect our financial performance 

our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets and sam’s clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets or sam’s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

impediments to the expansion of our international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sam’s clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the united states our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our international segment and our future financial performance 

failure to attract and retain qualified associates and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel or if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be affected adversely 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart stores segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarts as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sam’s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs including edlp rollbacks store within a store and store of the community have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see “item 1 business” above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and nonfood needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we currently conduct operations in argentina brazil canada costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras japan mexico nicaragua puerto rico and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china during fiscal 2008 our international operations generated 242 of our net sales as a result of recent acquisitions of operations in foreign countries we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years despite the recent dispositions of our operations in germany and south korea our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future in addition foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

natural disasters and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes and geopolitical events such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located or terrorist attacks disrupting transportation and utility systems both internationally and domestically could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution centers the lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption in our communications with our stores these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

the significant property damage experienced by the company and others resulting from the hurricanes in fiscal year 2006 resulted in substantial increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others the insurance coverage offered to the company for named windstorms such as hurricanes and tropical storms was substantially more limited and carried higher premiums than the coverage previously available to us as a result the company has chosen to be primarily selfinsured for losses that may result from named windstorms 

  

named windstorm activity was minimal in fiscal 2008 and the company did not incur any significant losses this past hurricane season 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v walmart stores inc  a classaction lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states the class as certified in dukes currently includes approximately 16 million present and former female associates the plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seek among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys’ fees on june 4 2004 the us district court hearing this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification which we have appealed on february 6 2007 a divided threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld the district court’s ruling on february 20 2007 the company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the court of appeals on november 11 2007 the threejudge panel withdrew its opinion of february 6 2007 and issued a revised opinion as a result the company’s petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot on january 8 2008 the company filed a new petition for rehearing en banc we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and is included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

if we do not maintain the security of customerrelated information we could damage our reputation with customers incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

as do most retailers we receive certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom and wwwsamsclubcom depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our computer systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize that cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 

  

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share

distribution during fiscal 2007 approximately 65 of the sam’s club nonfuel purchases were shipped from the sam’s club segment’s dedicated distribution facilities and some of the walmart stores segment’s distribution centers for perishable items jewelry tires and product returns suppliers shipped the balance of the sam’s club purchases directly to sam’s club locations the principal focus of our sam’s club’s distribution operations is on crossdocking product while stored inventory is minimized crossdocking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers without extra storage shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a crossdock facility sometimes less than an hour a combination of seven companyowned and operated distribution facilities 13 thirdparty owned and operated facilities and two thirdparty owned and operated import distribution centers constitute the overall distribution structure for the sam’s club segment to support the samsclubcom business sam’s club uses one thirdparty owned and operated distribution center in texas two of the companyowned and operated facilities are located in texas with single facilities located in arizona arkansas colorado indiana and minnesota of the thirdparty owned and operated facilities two are in california and one is in each of florida georgia illinois maryland michigan missouri new hampshire north carolina ohio pennsylvania and washington the thirdparty operated import facilities are located in california and south carolina sam’s club uses a combination of our private truck fleet as well as common carriers to transport nonperishable merchandise from distribution centers to clubs we contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs

merchandise the merchandising strategy for the international segment is similar to that of our operations in the united states in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale while brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales several store brands not found in the united states have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the international segment operates in addition steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise 

operations the hours of operation for operating units in the international segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation while sales are primarily on a cashandcarry basis credit cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer 

seasonal aspects of operations the international segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent generally the highest volume of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter the seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays festivals and customs as well as different climatic conditions 

competition the international segment competes with a variety of local national and international chains in the supermarket discount department drug variety specialty stores supercentertype stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate and in mexico with local national and international restaurant chains our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the international segment determines to a large extent our competitive position in our international units our ability to effectively operate the food departments has a major impact on the segment’s competitive position in the markets where we operate 

distribution we utilize a total of 126 distribution facilities located in argentina brazil canada china costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras japan mexico nicaragua puerto rico and the united kingdom through these facilities we process and distribute both imported and domestic product to the operating units of the international segment during fiscal 2007 approximately 78 of the international segment’s purchases flowed through these distribution facilities suppliers ship the balance of the international segment’s purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate a combination of companyowned and operated distribution facilities and thirdparty facilities makes up the overall distribution structure for the international segment the international segment operates export consolidation facilities in california florida and texas in support of product flow to our mexican asian and central and south american markets additionally a walmart stores segment distribution center in pennsylvania exports products to our operations in canada

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

general economic factors both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance in the united states higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs inflation higher levels of unemployment higher consumer debt levels higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our walmart stores segment and sam’s club segment change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rates fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the united states increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect the operations and operating results of our walmart stores segment and sam’s club segment high levels of unemployment inflation changes in tax and other laws currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our international segment 

we may face impediments to our expansion in the united states including conversions of discount stores into supercenters which may adversely affect our financial performance 

our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets and sam’s clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets or sam’s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

impediments to the expansion of our international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sam’s clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the united states our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our international segment and our future financial performance 

failure to attract and retain qualified associates and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel or if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be affected adversely 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart stores segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores and hypermarts as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sam’s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs including edlp rollbacks store within a store and store of the community have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see “item 1 business” above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to 

  

merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we currently conduct operations in argentina brazil canada costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras japan mexico nicaragua puerto rico and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china during fiscal 2007 our international operations generated 223 of our net sales as a result of recent acquisitions of operations in foreign countries we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years despite the recent dispositions of our operations in germany and south korea our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future in addition foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

natural disasters and geopolitical events costs could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes and geopolitical events such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located or terrorist attacks disrupting transportation and utility systems both internationally and domestically could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution centers the lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating and the reduction in the availability of products in our stores these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

  

the significant property damage experienced by the company and others resulting from the hurricanes in fiscal year 2006 resulted in substantial increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others the insurance coverage offered to the company for named windstorms such as hurricanes and tropical storms was substantially more limited and carried higher premiums as a result the company has chosen to be primarily selfinsured for losses that may result from named windstorms 

named windstorm activity was minimal in fiscal 2007 and the company did not incur any significant losses this past hurricane season 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v walmart stores inc  a classaction lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states the class as certified in dukes currently includes approximately 16 million present and former female associates the plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seek among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys’ fees the us district court hearing this case has issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification which we have appealed recently a divided threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld the district court’s ruling and we are now asking that the ruling be reconsidered by a larger panel of that court of appeals we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and is included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

if we do not maintain the security of customerrelated information we could damage our reputation with customers incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

as do most retailers we receive certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at wwwwalmartcom and wwwsamsclubcom depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations

the company is involved in discussions with the california air resources board “carb” to resolve a notice of violation issued by carb alleging that the company sold portable fuel containers and spouts in california which were not compliant with california’s portable fuel containers and spouts regulations carb alleges that in june 2006 the company offered for sale various noncompliant 5gallon portable fuel containers the company conducted its own research and discovered possible sales of additional items between 2002 and 2006 which may not have been compliant with the regulations the company voluntarily reported this additional information to carb the parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter

on february 1 2007 the company received from the epa a request pursuant to section 114a of the federal clean air act seeking detailed information regarding all nonessential products containing ozonedepleting substances including products such as loony string which walmart may have sold or distributed since january 1 2002 on march 8 2007 the epa issued a revised request for information in which it limited its request to string products including loony string silly string and fiesta string and covering the period from 2004 to the present walmart is in the process of gathering the information requested

the development of our company 

although walmart was incorporated in delaware in october 1969 the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when sam m walton opened a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport arkansas in 1946 his brother james l walton opened a similar store in versailles missouri until 1962 our founders’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores in that year the first walmart discount city which was a discount store was opened in fiscal 1984 we opened our first three sam’s clubs and in fiscal 1988 we opened our first supercenter in fiscal 1999 we opened our first neighborhood market 

in fiscal 1992 we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in mexico in which we owned a 50 interest along with cifra sa de cv “cifra” in fiscal 1998 we acquired the controlling interest in cifra and in february 2000 cifra officially changed its name to walmart de mexico sa de cv since fiscal 1992 our international presence has continued to expand and at january 31 2006 we had international operations in argentina brazil canada germany japan mexico puerto rico south korea and the united kingdom we also operate through joint ventures in china and at january 31 2006 owned a minority interest in carhco

our growth measured both by our net sales and net income occurs in large measure as a result of our domestic and international expansion programs along with comparative store sales increases for fiscal 2006 and prior years we considered comparative store sales to be sales at stores that were open as of february 1st of the prior fiscal year and which had not been expanded or relocated since that date comparative store sales are also referred to as “samestore” sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparative store sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparative store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies beginning in fiscal 2007 we changed our method of calculating comparative store sales these changes are described in our current report on form 8k that we furnished to the sec on february 2 2006

the growth in the net sales and operating net income of our walmart stores segment and our sam’s club segment depends to a substantial degree on our expansion programs our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets and sam’s clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets or sam’s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts our financial performance could be adversely affected 

impediments to the expansion of our international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business strategy for our international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sam’s clubs not 

  

previously operated in those markets as in the united states our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in consummating the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we believe we will be ultimately able to integrate successfully any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our international segment and our future financial performance 

failure to attract and retain qualified associates and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs generally including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel or if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be affected adversely 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart stores segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarts as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sam’s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs including edlp rollbacks store within a store and store of the community have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods sold our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see “item 1 business” above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we currently conduct operations in argentina brazil canada costa rico el salvador germany guatemala honduras japan mexico nicaragua puerto rico south korea and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china during fiscal 2006 our international operations generated 201 of our net sales as a result of recent acquisitions of operations in foreign countries we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future in addition foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

natural disasters and geopolitical events costs could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes and geopolitical events such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located and attacks disrupting transportation systems could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution centers the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply or products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

we expect that the significant property damage experienced by the company and others during last year’s hurricanes will result in substantial increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others as a result the company will likely face higher property insurance premiums an increase in retained risk or a combination of the two which could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial condition and results of operations we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v walmart stores inc  a classaction lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states the class as certified in dukes currently includes approximately 16 million present and former female associates the plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seek among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys’ fees the us district court hearing this case has issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference in this form 10k and is included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k

general 

  

walmart stores inc “walmart” or the “company” operates retail stores in various formats around the world walmart is committed to growing by improving the standard of living for our customers throughout the world we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices “edlp” while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect integrity and diversity edlp is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change erratically under frequent promotional activity our fiscal year ends on january 31 during the fiscal year ended january 31 2005 we had net sales of 2852 billion 

  

our walmart stores segment is the largest segment of our business accounting for 673 of our fiscal 2005 sales this segment consists of three different retail formats all of which operate in the united states including 

  

   

   

   

our sam’s club segment consists of membership warehouse clubs which operate in the united states and accounts for 130 of our fiscal 2005 sales our focus for sam’s club is to provide exceptional value on brandname merchandise at “members only” prices for both business and personal use our sam’s clubs average approximately 128000 square feet in size 

  

our international segment consists of retail operations in eight countries and puerto rico this segment generated 197 of our fiscal 2005 sales the international segment includes several different formats of retail stores and restaurants including discount stores supercenters and sam’s clubs that operate outside the united states additionally we own an unconsolidated minority interest of approximately 37 of the seiyu ltd “seiyu” a retailer in japan 

  

we maintain our principal offices at 702 sw 8th street bentonville arkansas 72716 

  

the development of our company 

  

although walmart was incorporated in delaware in october 1969 the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when sam m walton opened a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport arkansas in 1946 his brother james l walton opened a similar store in versailles missouri until 1962 our founders’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores in that year the first walmart discount city which was a discount store was opened in fiscal 1984 we opened our first three sam’s clubs and in fiscal 1988 we opened our first supercenter in fiscal 1999 we opened our first neighborhood market 

  

in fiscal 1992 we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in mexico in which we had a 50 interest along with cifra sa de cv “cifra” in fiscal 1998 we acquired the controlling interest in cifra and in february 2000 cifra officially changed its name to walmart de mexico sa de cv since fiscal 1992 our international presence has continued to expand and at january 31 2005 we had international operations in argentina brazil canada germany mexico puerto rico south korea and the united kingdom we also operate through joint ventures in china and own a minority interest in seiyu 

  

at january 31 2005 we operated in the united states 1353 discount stores 1713 supercenters 551 sam’s clubs and 85 neighborhood markets internationally at january 31 2005 the company operated units in argentina 11 brazil 149 canada 262 germany 91 south korea 16 mexico 679 puerto rico 54 and the united kingdom 282 we also operated 43 stores through joint ventures in china at january 31 2005 additionally seiyu then operated 403 stores throughout japan 

  

our growth measured both by our net sales and net income occurs in large measure as a result of our domestic and international expansion programs along with comparative store sales increases we consider comparative store sales to be sales at stores that were open as of february 1st of the prior fiscal year and which have not been expanded or relocated since that date comparative store sales are also referred to as “samestore” sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparative store sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparative store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

  

the following tables provide summary information concerning the additions of units and square footage for discount stores supercenters neighborhood markets and sam’s clubs in the united states and international units in each of our fiscal years from 2001 through 2005

merchandise the merchandising strategy for the international operating segment is similar to that of our operations in the united states in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale while brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales several store brands not found in the united states have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the international segment operates in addition steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise 

  

operations the hours of operation for operating units in the international segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation while sales are primarily on a cashandcarry basis credit cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer

risk factors 

  

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only ones that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 

  

general economic and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

  

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs unfavorable foreign exchange rates and economic factors that adversely affect consumer demand for the merchandise we offer change the mix of products sold to one with a lower average gross margin result in increased cost of sales slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory could adversely affect the financial performance of our walmart stores and sam’s clubs operations in the united states high levels of unemployment inflation changes in tax and other laws currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries adversely affect our gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in those countries 

  

we may face impediments to our expansion in the united states including conversions of discount stores into supercenters 

  

the growth in the net sales and operating net income of our walmart stores segment and our sam’s club segment depends to a substantial degree on our expansion programs our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional discount stores supercenters neighborhood markets and sam’s clubs and to convert discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new discount stores supercenters neighborhood markets or sam’s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

impediments to the expansion of our international operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

our business strategy for our international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing international business as well as by opening of new units in the countries in which we are currently operating as in the united states our ability to open new stores in our current markets depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive preexisting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units in certain markets if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

we can give no assurance that we will continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices or be successful in consummating the acquisition of any such candidate in addition while we believe we will be ultimately able to integrate successfully any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

failure to attract and retain qualified associates and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs generally while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel or if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be affected adversely 

  

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators 

  

the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products services and other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart stores segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercentertype stores hypermarts as well as internetbased retailers and catalog businesses our sam’s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarket supercentertype stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection services offered to customers location and price our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs including edlp rollbacks store within a store and store of the community have allowed us to successfully compete against our competitors in most instances where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods sold our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could affect our financial performance see “item 1 business” below for additional discussion of our competitive situation 

  

certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greater financial resources better access to merchandise greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

risks associated with the vendors from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required vendor standards of conduct our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced outside the united states political instability the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our vendor standards merchandise quality issues trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other issues affecting our vendors could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

  

we currently conduct operations in argentina brazil canada germany mexico puerto rico south korea and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china we also own a minority interest in seiyu a retailer in japan during fiscal 2005 our international operations generated 197 of our net sales our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future in addition foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations which could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of 

  

managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations 

  

we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may affect our financial condition and results of operation 

  

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to the company’s financial condition or results of operations we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v walmart stores inc  a classaction lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states the class as certified currently includes approximately 16 million present and former female associates the plaintiffs in this case allege we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seek among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys’ fees the us district court hearing this case has issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification we discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “item 3 legal proceedings” and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference in this form 10k

the development of our company 

  

although walmart was incorporated in delaware in october 1969 the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when sam m walton opened a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport arkansas in 1946 his brother james l walton opened a similar store in versailles missouri until 1962 our founders’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores in that year the first walmart discount city which was a discount store was opened in fiscal 1984 we opened our first three sam’s clubs and in fiscal 1988 we opened our first supercenter
